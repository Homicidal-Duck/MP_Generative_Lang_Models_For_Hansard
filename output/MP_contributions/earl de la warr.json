["<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord thorneycroft for giving us the opportunity to have this debate at such an opportune moment <e> <s> we have been enabled to have a wide-ranging discussion about the <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to congratulate the noble lord lord ross of marnock on his maiden speech and we have all been impressed by the depth and sincerity of his feeling for the scottish people <e> <s> scotland is not he will be happy to hear a subject on which i am accustomed to speak though he may be interested to hear that i have the honour to be married to a lady whose great uncle was sir henry campbell bannerman the liberal prime minister and that perhaps brings a slightly non-contentious element into my congratulations <e> <s> we have it in common that we both i when i made my maiden speech and he today did not worry too much about picking a contentious debate <e> <s> i recall the guffaws from some of my noble friends when i said that i was in an invidious position because it was a bill with which i most heartily disagreed <e> <s> i think i then proceeded to put the matter right nevertheless we have been very <e>", "<cs> i too hope that the noble lord lord jacques will not press his amendment but i have to say that i have listened very carefully to all the arguments and am much impressed by those who think that traders will find themselves in some difficulties <e> <s> the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith quoted the example of a promotion which contained free offers <e> <s> this went fairly close to my heart because until a few months ago i had spent years trying to dispose to the public television sets mainly for rental <e> <s> whether or not i was a success is beside the point but i know well that the practice in times of fierce competition is of going further and further towards giving away larger and larger gifts <e> <s> it may well be that that is anti-competitive <e> <s> nevertheless i have taken the point of my noble friend lord trefgarne that you must decide one way or the other but i hope the government will take on board the points which have been made because they will not go away and they will assuredly come up on report <e>", "<cs> i understood that the purpose of the amendment was to enable the facts to be ascertained and not the judgment <e> <s> i suggest and i do so from very considerable experience of no fewer than two price commission investigations that an investigation like this can with the best will in the world very easily fall into the trap of failing in the short time that it has available to it to pick up all the facts <e> <s> i believe therefore that it is enormously for the benefit of the director to have the opportunity to discuss with the firm concerned whether all the facts are right before he publishes them <e> <s> i have known cases admittedly with the price commission where the price commission rather made fools of themselves because they had not bothered to check their findings with the company concerned <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne again spoke about a judgment in a court of law <e> <s> i think there is no suggestion of that it is simply giving both sides the opportunity to make sure that the facts are right not the judgment <e> <s> that is why i said that if the government will accept the spirit behind this amendment they may see their way to being able to do something about it at report stage without in fact accepting the wording of this amendment <e> <s> may i have any hopes of that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press this point <e> <s> the noble lord said that the facts would be checked <e> <s> what we are asking for is that the company concerned see the draft of the report in which the facts are stated and they check that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government white paper gives a comprehensive picture and a good one of this countrys defence posture and capability but it is angled perhaps somewhat naturally very much towards our nato commitments <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord hill-norton for the way in which he drew attention so forcefully to the danger of over-emphasising nato and paying too scant a regard to the dangers that exist in various other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister of state has given us a brilliant account of the main features of this highly sensitive and important bill certainly one of the most important bills of the session <e> <s> the bill is designed as he said to make a start in dealing with the present imbalance that exists in favour of organised labour at the expense of the employer <e> <s> this imbalance has quite clearly gone much too far particularly during the last five years when the last government were in power <e> <s> the bill starts to tackle this problem and does so effectively in my opinion but it does it selectively and with a noticeable moderation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i was taken unaware by that question <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would be good enough to repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not said that it will prevent it <e> <s> i have said that in due course when people realise that it is actionable and illegal it will have a dramatic effect <e> <s> we heard from the noble lord a great deal of history about the act <e> <s> we have heard by implication that two acts have produced some very unforeseen circumstances <e> <s> i cannot foresee what is going to happen but i am perhaps being more optimistic than the noble lord lord mccarthy when i say that i believe that the mood of the country is such that now this sort of legislation will bite <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord would he accept it if i were to tell him that in another place when the secretary of state was asked during the course of the debate on report whether he would give an undertaking that the green paper would be followed by further legislation he specifically declined to do so <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in the way that he interpreted what the noble lord lord mccarthy said about ballots and the way he dealt with them <e> <s> clearly he thoroughly dislikes them <e> <s> i found it quite amazing and horrifying to hear the pious way in which the noble lord dealt with the question of trade union democracy <e> <s> he even went so far as to compare the operation of trade union democracy with the operation of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend lord colville one or two <e>", "<cs> i very much doubt whether the noble lord although he obviously thinks he is is really talking on behalf of all unions <e> <s> i entirely agree with the arguments my two noble friends have just put forward but is the noble lord quite sure that a non-craft union is going to want this sort of restriction applied <e> <s> i cannot believe it <e> <s> many unions are looking hard for members <e> <s> that is one of the things we deal with in connection with the whole closed shop argument <e> <s> i should like his assurance because i know how close he is to the unions that they think this is sensible <e> <s> i should have thought that they thought of it just as we do on this side <e>", "<cs> is there not a difference in this case between a craft union and a general union <e>", "<cs> as i suspected this is angled towards protection of the craft unions <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has proved the point <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord and i am a little surprised that he has lent himself to this although he has done it on the best legal grounds is once more nibbling away at personal rights in favour of something which is protective towards the trade unions <e> <s> this is something which is running right through the opposition amendments <e> <s> the industrial tribunal has a great reputation <e> <s> let us remember that we are seeking to protect the jobs of men whose livelihood will be at stake <e> <s> i suggest that there can be very little wrong in leaning over backwards to make sure that justice is done <e> <s> after all there may be cases i do not think this is too fanciful a suggestion where further facts might come to light after the hearing by the industrial tribunal <e> <s> i would suggest it would be right and in the spirit of this bill to leave in the words or fact <e>", "<cs> i do not think they necessarily do but we are not dealing with that particular issue at the moment <e> <s> i should like to confine myself to the particular issue at stake which was making sure that the individual who is in danger of losing his job had every opportunity of protection <e> <s> the noble lord may well be right that his suggestion follows from what i have said <e> <s> so be it but that is not part of my contention at this time <e>", "<cs> i feel inclined to advise my noble friend to consider the amendment sympathetically <e> <s> the case for it has been well enough argued for me simply to add that the amendment seems to be all right and should be examined by the government <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene for one moment <e> <s> which amendment is he talking about <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a point to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i am a very small employer in that i am a farmer employing eight men <e> <s> it is a grotesque idea that i should take someone on and write a letter to him telling him what might happen if he was to be dismissed <e> <s> this is just not how things happen not on farms anyhow and i would hope not in any other business <e> <s> if i could use the technical words it does not pass the test of practicality good sense or commonsense <e>", "<cs> is it really necessary to dot the is and cross the ts <e> <s> i know very little about the law but if somebody is joined as a co-defendant is it not something that as night follows day <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend who referred to the extraordinary use of the adverb slightly <e> <s> my noble friend dealt with the point adequately but i ask your lordships commitee to consider what would happen if one of the mass membership unions a union with a membership of seven figures were involved in a matter of this kind <e> <s> god bless my soul <e> <s> it could be the secondary picketing of all time <e>", "<cs> well no doubt the noble lord will tell me why not <e> <s> i found what he said to be an extraordinary and novel doctrine on two counts first in regard to the use of the word slightly and secondly by the praying in aid of the advice that the tuc gave their members <e>", "<cs> i take the point but that is not what the noble lords amendment says <e> <s> the amendment permits as many as there are in the union to go in aid <e> <s> the noble lord has told us that he wants to widen things slightly <e> <s> had the amendment been true to the description he has given it would have been quite a different matter but the amendment is not worded in the way that the noble lord has put the matter <e>", "<cs> i want to start by congratulating my noble friend on the simple and persuasive way in which he put his arguments which are very strong <e> <s> however i have to say that i thoroughly disagree with him <e> <s> i shall not be arguing the case because it is more properly argued and will be much better argued from the front bench <e> <s> i want to confine myself to saying a few positive things about clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> i am encouraged <e> <s> i should like to call in aid something that was written by a body which is known for its somewhat hawkish attitudes namely the institute of directors who said <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend has to make another statement will he consider being rather more specific than he has felt able to be in the last two or three statements that have been made about the long history of anglo-french local discord in that part of the world <e> <s> it is a matter which has not been referred to once and is one of which most people are totally unaware <e>", "<cs> my lords before i ask my brief question perhaps i may say how much i welcome what my noble friend lord hill-norton has said that this is indeed the best news for nato for many years <e> <s> having said that may i ask my noble friend whether he could be a little more specific about his description of the control of this weapon as being single key and under <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell said he feared that someone would get up and talk about matters of principle <e> <s> i can put his mind at rest i am not going to talk about matters of principle <e> <s> this is a pragmatic thing <e> <s> this is done because the government recognise the extent to which this country is hurt by excessive striking <e> <s> this is done in order in my opinion to make people think very hard of the consequences of their actions before they take them <e> <s> the effect of this in the unofficial strike will be to penalise those who do it and quite rightly <e> <s> the effect of this in a large measure in official strikes will be to enable the union if it has thought the thing out carefully to support its members financially in doing what the union has asked them to do <e> <s> this is what it is all about as i see it in its effect from the governments point of view <e>", "<cs> i really must ask for a moments indulgence <e> <s> i specifically said that it would make the unions think very hard before they decided whether they would bring people out on strike <e> <s> that is what i said <e> <s> i did not use the word punish and i hope that the noble lord will withdraw that particular word because it is not right <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords for the avoidance of doubt i should like to start by saying that i am on totally common ground with my noble friend lord de lisle my noble friend lord duncan-sandys and the noble lord lord harris of high cross in that i like them hate and detest every aspect of closed shops and believe them to be monstrous intrusions into the personal liberty of men and women <e> <s> but having said that i must now stick closely to the amendment <e> <s> i must congratulate my noble friend lord duncan-sandys in that he has actually talked to the amendment <e> <s> if i may say so with respect my noble friend lord de lisle and the noble lord lord harris of high cross ranged across somewhat wider ground <e>", "<cs> a timorous little mousie <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief because there are many people to speak <e> <s> this afternoon is i believe a moment of extreme importance in the whole turgid history of industrial legislation <e> <s> the importance lies not so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that other aerospace projects include flight simulators which are a vital part of pilot training and whose british manufacturers have in the past suffered badly like aeroplanes from transatlantic competition <e>", "<cs> my lords the fourth channel has been talked about for so long that it is refreshing that at last the necessary enabling bill is before us <e> <s> i think that the governments plans are right and that the structure which this bill sets up will work <e> <s> it has my full support <e> <s> i want to talk about a few of the wider aspects of the television scene the problems and the possibilities in order to help us to try to see where the fourth channel will fit into the broad spectrum of the next years of television <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord willis for the eloquent way in which he painted his broad canvas <e>", "<cs> we would be very much helped if my noble friend could be more specific about the nature of the malpractices <e>", "<cs> they are practices but are we not getting a little emotive if we call them malpractices <e>", "<cs> i do not want to propose any particular solution but i feel it necessary to say and i shall be rather blunt about this that my noble friend appears to have sucked in everything that he has been told by the incorporated society of advertisers and possibly has paid too little attention to the point of view of the contractors <e> <s> there appears to me in what he said to be an assumption that the contractors are people who are likely to commit malpractices <e> <s> he accuses them of acting as monopolies <e> <s> probably he does not pay enough attention to the fact that television advertising is in severe competition with all kinds of other advertising <e> <s> he recited a number of what he called malpractices and i think he said that one of the things was collaborative rate fixing by which i take it he means that those who are advertising in <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend then tell me what he means by collaborative rates <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> i do not think i want to enlarge on what i have said other than to try to suggest to your lordships committee that you have had from my noble friend a picture which despite the best will in the world is somewhat distorted as between the attitudes of the advertisers and the practices of the contractors which to my certain knowledge are not the fearsome practices that have been suggested by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> when i read this amendment i did not like it at all <e> <s> now that it has been so well explained by the noble lord lord ponsonby i cannot say i like it any better but i do not dislike it more <e> <s> it seems to be based on the assumption that the contractors are really going to do their best if they need to to jip the fourth channel people to their own benefit <e> <s> it appears that there is an assumption that this is what is likely so this is what we had better guard against <e>", "<cs> i have been very dismayed as a farmer to hear my noble friends answer <e> <s> i think that he has dealt with a great deal which if i may say so is not relevant to my noble friend lord stanleys amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that there is such admirable mechanistic sense in the amendment that my noble friend should deal with it much more sympathetically <e> <s> all that he is being asked as i understand it is that the matter shall come to the attention of the minister of agriculture at the earliest possible moment and certainly at a moment very much earlier than in the example which my noble friend lord stanley quoted <e> <s> i do not believe that my noble friend has taken this point and i ask him to reconsider it and try to do something a little better than uttering if i may say so pious hopes that the two ministries will work together <e>", "<cs> originally i had some very slight doubts about the need for clause because it seemed to me that there was some danger that we were making use of statute where exhortation would be quite sufficient <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord said i believe there is <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> what i said was socialist thinking was that we should go down the road of establishing yet another training authority yet another piece of bureaucracy with which to load the contractors <e> <s> i made no reference to the authority itself as it is now <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i should like to raise just one question <e> <s> i shall not deal with the sex discrimination side but she has made some very valuable points about the need for training in industry <e> <s> has she seen fit to have discussions with the authority to see what they think about it with all their knowledge about what goes on as regards the affairs of the contractors <e>", "<cs> i expected that and i did not ask the question without reason <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend seems to be absolutely determined to stick to his presumption that the contractors between them have an absolute monopoly <e> <s> it is a presumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reminder <e> <s> i do recall that in answer to a question by me he did run off some of the practices but i have to say and i wish to be fair to him that they were a number of technical terms run off very quickly and they did not strike me as amounting to an explanation that was in any way satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to say a few words in support of this amendment <e> <s> it does two things <e> <s> first it creates a useful sieve to stop too many frivolous complaints coming before the commission <e> <s> secondly it performs the very useful function of keeping the people who now deal with complaints in the two organisations on their toes <e> <s> if we have this commission there must be a danger that people will go straight to it and that the existing mechanisms for dealing with complaints will wither <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to what my noble friend lady trumpington has said <e> <s> i find it very hard to accept the thesis of the noble baroness lady seear that the television contractors should be treated differently that they should be treated as golden calves <e> <s> she has admitted very openly that there are many industries in which training is not adequately given to women and people of other ethnic origin and there is much to commend in what she has said <e> <s> but just because we happen to have an industry under scrutiny and under our control it is a great pity to take advantage of it and to impose by statute something which would be much better done by exhortation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to sound a strong note of warning about the starting date for the fourth channel which is provisionally planned for early <e> <s> at present public demand for a new channel scarcely exists <e> <s> i would say that in fact relatively few members of the viewing public are yet aware of it <e> <s> so we can wait <e> <s> indeed at this time of national economic stringency we certainly ought to pause before going over this particular brink for it is a new call on the nations resources quite possibly at the very worst moment <e>", "<cs> to launch the fourth channel during an advertising recession would in my opinion be asking for serious trouble <e> <s> it would seriously damage the longer-term chances of that channel <e> <s> it could even affect the whole structure of independent television and not least the quality of the programmes on channels both old and new <e> <s> we must remember that there is no apparent instrument for controlling the ceiling of expenditure by the fourth channel should advertising revenue fail to emerge in sufficient quantity <e> <s> among the casualties would be the levy which would put an added burden on the public sector borrowing requirement of as much as million a year <e> <s> one hundred million pounds may not sound like much in terms of the whole borrowing requirement but i know how it sounds to me it sounds like a jolly expensive luxury when times are hard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty in the following terms <e>", "<cs> my lords no motion on the humble address would be complete without a special tribute to her majesty for her majestys dedication and untiring work <e> <s> her majesty not only through her high office but by her own example is a source of inspiration to her majestys subjects and indeed to the whole world <e> <s> she is our finest ambassador <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lords who have just spoken on this question particularly on the penalty of imprisonment up to two years for conviction on indictment of an offence under clause <e> <s> i think it is totally inappropriate for reasons which i shall not argue any further <e> <s> my noble friend is probably aware that i shall be dealing with this in an amendment on a later clause <e> <s> meanwhile like other noble lords who have spoken i think it would be extremely helpful if my noble friend could say a word about this <e>", "<cs> i suppose that this debate will have to come to an end in due course and i hope that it does so before it becomes either more complicated or more colourful <e> <s> to me it is certainly very complicated <e> <s> but in an endeavour to try to simplify what has been said i should like to suggest that there is a quantitative element in what we are talking about as well as a qualitative one <e> <s> certain noble lords have said that sssis is far too many for the nature conservancy council at its present size to deal with <e> <s> others have said and the noble baroness lady white said it very trenchantly that to go as low as is quite ludicrous <e> <s> i agree with both statements <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has been able to tell us and i shall be happy to withdraw this amendment but in all fairness to the noble earl i cannot do so without warning him in if it is not too impertinent what i might describe as the sternest terms that it is my intention to get the word imprisonment right out of clause and unless that happens i shall have no hesitation in dividing the house at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am glad to say that i am the fourth in a row of noble lords who are speaking who have recently visited exmoor and what a lovely visit it was <e> <s> it is something that like my noble friend lord onslow i shall never forget not having been there for decades <e> <s> i strongly disagree with this series of amendments and that includes the amendment of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i hope that the government will stick to the clause as it stands and resist putting an ultimate power into the hands of anybody however remote he may be <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend the figure of had taken my attention <e> <s> at any rate there is not too much indication there that heathland and moorland on exmoor are on the point of disappearing or that there is any threat from the farmers in that direction <e> <s> the indication is exactly the opposite <e> <s> it is that things are very stable and under good control already <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is being totally fair to me because i gave him this phrase last night and i fear that he has been working up an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords much has been made by noble lords on the other side of the fact that this is an all-party amendment in order presumably to create the impression that no politics are involved <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> there are just a handful of maverick peers on my side who in their obsession about this subject as they are such good countrymen have forgotten the very simple fact that the tory party does not believe in compulsion but believes in letting people <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the amendment as strongly as i disagreed with the amendment of my noble friend lord ridley at the committee stage <e> <s> my disagreement is not really surprising since as the noble baroness said the wording now is exactly the same except for the four lines which as she explained add the condition that a farmer must have been offered and have refused an agreement before a moorland conservation order can be applied <e> <s> for reasons which i shall explain a little later on i cannot i fear help feeling that this modest addition is designed to make the house feel that there has been added something of some substance that will alter the sense of the amendment <e> <s> but farmers will perceive not one haporth of difference and they would be right because the result does not differ in any way <e> <s> so we are i repeat debating the same amendment as last time and we shall i fear have to go over some of the same ground again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not wish to be thought to be dodging questions but i really do feel that that is something that my noble friend lord avon would himself wish to deal with <e> <s> that is another way of saying that i know my place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i take that point <e> <s> on the other hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i take that point <e> <s> on the other hand one can look at it in exactly the opposite way and say that one must have the odds in favour of the local authority <e> <s> so be it this is a matter of opinion <e> <s> we have discussed lost acreage before and not surprisingly it has come up again though i must <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to begin by giving your lordships one fact which i believe is central to our debate today <e> <s> it is this over the last years our production has increased on an average by per cent <e> <s> a year <e> <s> that is something just over per cent <e> <s> during the same time our wages have increased by per cent <e> <s> is it any wonder that we find ourselves in trouble and suffering worse in this world recession than almost any other country in the world <e> <s> it is in the light of this shocking state of affairs that we have to determine to what extent if any new laws can help us out of our troubles <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always rather suspicious when the noble lord lord bruce of donington starts by saying this is a non-party matter <e> <s> nevertheless he did not leave us in much doubt for very long as to how he really felt about it <e> <s> i think we should be quite clear that for years the operation of this register of business names has been making an ass of the law and that is something which i know none of us likes at all <e> <s> we have spoken about a rogues charter i should have thought that noble lords would know very well that if a chap is out to cheat you then my goodness <e> <s> he will do it in a more subtle way than by dodging this register of business names <e> <s> it is not there to stop the rogue it never has and it never will <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to try to be as crisp and as brief as the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> i doubt whether i shall quite succeed in either <e> <s> about half of my business life was spent in putting electronic signals down cables to television sets at the other end <e> <s> this we did under licence from the post office with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to be corrected <e> <s> i probably could have chosen a better example <e> <s> the treasury approach as things now are is not good enough by half and half is almost exactly correct in the arithmetical sense too <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point but it is a point which i feel that my noble friend lord trefgarne would rather deal with himself <e> <s> that is the soft way of saying that i am not going to be caught by that one <e> <s> nevertheless quite seriously i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i want to end the way i started by applauding the secretary of states brave endeavour for so much in terms of the re-creation of wealth and prosperity in this country depends upon its successful outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> would he not agree that this can be a two-way affair and that system x for instance the grand new post office exchange can be exported very widely indeed and that the two things can at least counter each other <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that i did say that it was of course politically inspired <e> <s> i then went on to say that i did not find it rooted in dogma <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very grateful if at this stage i could ask a question about practicality <e> <s> the noble lord has said that he does not want to go over old ground again and i do not think it is necessary to do so but from what the noble lord lord ponsonby has said it appears that he is looking for a register of some sort even though it be if you like departmentalised geographically and spread around the country <e> <s> what is not clear to me is whether he is talking about an attempt to get a per cent <e> <s> registry that is to say per cent <e> <s> of existing business names registered somewhere <e> <s> this is where there is a link with past debates <e> <s> if i may say so what was dealt with inadequately in previous amendments was that those who argued them never said how they would attack the question of getting up-to-date the existing tattered probably only -per cent-accurate register <e> <s> it was on the problems of updating that it seemed to me the arguments fell down in terms of practicality <e> <s> i am seeking for comments from the noble lord <e> <s> is he trying to finish up with a register though it be a series of local registers all over the country which is up-to-date <e> <s> is he therefore going to demand that there be a sort of process of re-registration of existing businesses right across the country so that we may end up with a series of local registers which will add up to per cent <e> <s> instead of the per cent <e> <s> to which it adds up now <e> <s> if he can answer that question then i think the house would be in a better position to assess the validity of his case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for elucidating that point <e> <s> all that i can say is that the mind boggles at the amount of work that will have to go into creating this per cent <e> <s> re-registration of all the million existing businesses <e> <s> i am sure that this is a real objection <e>", "<cs> this is rather a curious situation <e> <s> i misunderstood the intention of my noble friend lord morris in just the same way as my noble friend lord trefgarne and the department and i had prepared a defence to say that it was quite wrong that british telecom should be denied the opportunity to compete in these fields <e> <s> but it appears that the argument which my noble friend has adduced is exactly the opposite <e> <s> therefore although it does no harm there perhaps on the whole it ought to stay <e> <s> even from the second answer of my noble friend lord trefgarne it appears if i may say so that the departments brief was based on a misunderstanding of the intention of this amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to me to be very useful to spell out this particular power that is given to british telecom <e> <s> it makes it quite clear that this is one of the ways that is open to it to run its business <e> <s> incidentally as i understand it although i happen to believe that it is not sufficient it is one of the ways by which british telecom can raise money from outside <e> <s> i think that there is a clue in this clause to the way in which the government wish it to conduct its business <e> <s> i regarded it as an important clause so i was surprised when my noble friend lord morris said that it was a drafting amendment <e> <s> it is surely much more than that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has implied that in the past british telecom have put the british manufacturers at risk <e> <s> is he implying that there have been substantial orders placed abroad to the exclusion of british manufacturers <e> <s> if he is i should be very surprised to hear that <e> <s> could he enlarge on that implication <e>", "<cs> i was trying to get the risk in its proper perspective that is all <e>", "<cs> the mention of single telephone instrument at this point is in fact the only time that single telephone instrument is mentioned in the bill <e> <s> it is absolutely crucial therefore that it should stay in because although it talks about duties it is in fact at this point that we find the protection for british telecom from the danger that it should have the right to provide the first telephone removed from it <e> <s> i believe that in financial and practical engineering terms british telecom would be at a grave disadvantage if it had this right removed from it <e> <s> after all telecommunications explosion or not it has the duty to provide a first-class telephone service and that i believe will always be its prime duty <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will give way for a moment is he not getting confused <e> <s> we are talking about the instrument we are not talking about the network <e> <s> of course it sometimes takes a long time to get the telephone it is taking me a long time down in sussex to get some cottages on the telephone <e> <s> but that is not because telephones are short it is because the lines from the network are short <e> <s> will he please consider confining his remarks to the particular issue under discussion which is the provision of telephones by british telecom ordered from various manufacturers and no more than that <e>", "<cs> i was using a very close analogy <e>", "<cs> when i studied this series of amendments i came to the conclusion that the government would be well advised to give way on them <e> <s> having heard the noble lord lord glenamara argue in favour of this amendment i am more than ever convinced that they should do so <e> <s> the requirement in the bill goes one stage too far in enabling indeed forcing the secretary of state to interfere in things <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend not think that a competent chairman and a competent managing director are well capable themselves of controlling a function like that <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend has been arguing against standards that are unnecessarily high not against r and d <e>", "<cs> i do not agree with the amendment <e> <s> i think it is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> there is no way in which it could be accepted while leaving the intention of the secretary of state about the bill intact <e> <s> so i personally would have nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> it is now obvious that amendment no <e> <s> was designed to be the beesley amendment <e> <s> however as the noble lord said matters overlapped a bit and we have presumably now said all that needs to be said about professor beesley <e> <s> i certainly have <e> <s> however i should like to suggest that we do not get into the frame of mind whereby if the noble lord is to press this amendment we vote about beesley <e> <s> in fact we will vote about whether the secretary of state should be constricted in what he may do as regards the licensing of end apparatus <e> <s> we well know that the intention of the secretary of state is wider than that that there may be matters like leasing of lines and other matters that go beyond the question of the supply and installation of apparatus <e> <s> therefore i would suggest to noble lords that this in its smaller way is again a wrecking amendment because it tries to constrict the secretary of state to something which is much less than the whole orbit of liberalisation which i fully support <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he has just said and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter which i agree with him is extremely important <e> <s> i must say immediately that i do not in fact agree with his amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the arguments will be well put by my noble friend but in simple terms it seems to me that in a nationalised industry and in a matter of this type the secretary of state must have the last word and the treasury must have a look-in although i suspect that it is the other way round and that the last word in fact lies with the treasury <e>", "<cs> indeed i can <e> <s> i said quite clearly and fortunately i was doing perhaps what i ought not to do that is i was working very carefully from a script when you have a nationalised industry that in matters of this sort the secretary of state must have the last word and the treasury must have a look in <e> <s> from that it will i hope be obvious to the noble lord that i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i welcomed the amendment because it gave me the opportunity to make some comments on this matter of private sector borrowing <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i think he is really trying to read into what i said more than was there <e> <s> to me it is unthinkable that when you have a nationalised industry the secretary of state and the treasury should not have some back-up responsibility <e> <s> it is unthinkable that they should be removed <e> <s> i am not suggesting that they should be removed <e> <s> i am suggesting that they should stay <e> <s> i am merely discussing how they use their powers <e> <s> surely the noble lord can accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i think the idea behind this amendment is a very sensible one indeed <e> <s> the secretary of state has after all given himself unusually wide powers over the whole industry british telecom in particular but not confined to british telecom <e> <s> i quite understand why he has done it <e> <s> he is trying to achieve something that is right at the heart of what has been called the new industrial revolution and in order to do that he has wanted to make sure that at least in reserve he has the powers to see that certain very important and new things happen <e> <s> so as i say it is understandable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be very grateful to the government for having taken on board this point and for having moved the two amendments which were suggested at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i have assumed like the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that the purpose of this particular paragraph was to make sure and to do no more than make sure that the corporation did not make use of its monopoly activities to subsidise its competitive activities <e> <s> in so far as that is its sole purpose i am perfectly happy with it and i think that it is quite fair <e>", "<cs> i should like to give my strong support to this amendment <e> <s> i worked for many years in a large firm not by many times as large as that in which the noble lord lord rochester worked but we had in common the fact that we did an enormous amount of our own training <e> <s> i feel although it might be slightly subjective as the noble lord lord rochester would feel in his own firm that it would be quite intolerable if a training board that we did not ask for and did not want came to an end and the company had to pay the not inconsiderable costs of winding it up <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the bbc is most anxious to close down this service next year <e> <s> would he also agree that it is becoming almost impossible to maintain these old sets because spares simply are not available <e> <s> would he further agree that second-hand monochrome -line sets can be bought very cheaply indeed <e> <s> therefore in so far as there is hardship i do not think it is relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord hunt to be a good group of amendments and in general a great improvement on what has been produced in another place <e> <s> the question of the reporting of changes of character in an area defined on the map is clearly a sensible one <e> <s> it is clearly a mistake to get involved in redrawing a map every year <e>", "<cs> my lords too should like to welcome the question which has been asked by my noble friend lord windlesham <e> <s> as he reminded us this study came out in may answers were required and no doubt were in by july and so december seems to be a very timely moment for the government to be asked this question <e> <s> i should like to say on a lighter note that although i can assure your lordships there has been no collusion between us in any way except for a telephone call this morning my noble friend lord windlesham and i can in a sense be called industrial cousins <e> <s> many years ago my noble friend lord windlesham was in associated rediffusion making programmes and i was in its first cousin rediffusion making television sets <e> <s> so that there has been a connection between us in broadcasting throughout many years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> he is being extremely helpful about this <e> <s> i had not thought it proper to mention specific names of city institutions but i assure the noble lord that willingness has gone a great deal further since this report was written <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the near doubling of bank borrowing by <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what criteria are used if any to check that an applicant company is admissible for this assistance in view of the fact that as he has said it is subsidised by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend enlighten me on a point which has been touched on already and which i know concerns greatly the ta council <e> <s> it concerns the question of the docking of unemployment benefits from territorial soldiers when they go on training weekends or on their fortnights camp <e> <s> is it a fact as i believe it to be that almost the whole of the benefit is lost when a territorial soldier who is unemployed performs these duties <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend help us by being a little more specific on this question of the timing of the allocation of channels that is to say as between the bbc and the independent contractors <e> <s> he has said very clearly and it is very welcome that he would like to see the independent contractors coming in <e> <s> what he has not been quite specific about i think is whether if the independent contractors can make up their minds in time they will get one of the first two channels or is the decision already taken that if they come in they will come in as number three <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord beswick for asking this very appropriate unstarred question at this particular time <e> <s> it seems to me that with the question of the a and the future of this countrys association with it go very much wider issues <e> <s> i want to be careful not to embarrass either british aerospace or the government or perhaps i should put it in the other order because i know that careful discussions are going on at this moment <e> <s> indeed some very senior members of british aerospace were in toulouse only about a fortnight ago doing some heavy work about the future of the aeroplane <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the long-term wealth of the world will depend on the existing mining companies who have all the expertise being given sufficient protection to encourage them to invest their money <e> <s> does he agree that there may be no other way of exploiting that wealth unless this protection is given to these great companies <e>", "<cs> i find this to be a very strong amendment and it is much stronger than anything that was moved in an earlier part of the bill <e> <s> it is not so much so of the first part of the amendment but of the second part which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords in april we had a debate in this house on the green paper entitled <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this amendment in the way it has been moved and followed up apparently carries with it some misunderstanding <e> <s> we talk about this statutory period <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie of troon talks about the compulsion to have a ballot <e> <s> of course there is no compulsion to have a ballot <e> <s> this is not a statutory thing <e> <s> it does not have to happen <e> <s> we tend to look at this provision as though we were going to move into a period when there were automatically going to be ballots <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e> <s> i feel very sad that my noble friend cannot accept this simple amendment <e> <s> it makes me feel that enormous numbers of man-hours must be spent in the department making absolutely certain that every single suggestion however simple must be blocked in some way <e> <s> i have followed this very carefully and i remember very well the discussion that took place on clause a couple of years ago in the bill <e> <s> here is a classic case <e> <s> sometimes it is a good idea to give away a little on something <e> <s> that is not flippant it is the truth <e> <s> so far as the noble viscounts argument is concerned it got very abstruse considering the simplicity of the case that was originally put up <e> <s> i think that my noble friend really should say to himself here is a case where the bill could not possibly suffer if i just for once gave way if that is what the opposition wants perhaps that is what i had better do <e>", "<cs> i would like to add one point <e> <s> i think we sometimes mislead ourselves by counting up the number of people who have been dismissed <e> <s> that is only half of it is it not <e> <s> there are also the countless number of people who live in fear of dismissal lest they do something which offends what one must in many cases describe as their lawful masters <e> <s> so it is not a quantifiable thing by any manner of means <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised that up to now no noble lord has mentioned the local authority called east kilbride <e> <s> i had a copy of that letter many weeks ago <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord mccarthy is very cross about this amendment but i too was extremely indignant when i read the letter that went out to all local authorities on the east kilbride list <e> <s> it was clear to me and although this is not evidence it was clear to the <e>", "<cs> i really do not feel disposed to widen the debate that far <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers for the excellent way in which he sought to comply with my inquiry which he said was a bit tough and rightly tough at this time of the morning <e> <s> he gave us a full explanation of how the government are feeling <e> <s> while i regret that they did not start this process earlier i welcome very much what my noble friend said about the governments intention to produce a consultative document <e> <s> this is an enormous advance <e> <s> i shall think very carefully about what has been said by all noble lords in particular by my noble friend and take these matters away and consider them very carefully <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i think the government have it about right as they have it now <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord stanley that local authorities ought to be notified of this so that they can all put themselves in the same position to deal with the rogue in the same way <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord monson was taking to task for using the word profit in connection with straw burning <e> <s> that is not why any of us do it <e> <s> i am not as big a straw burner as the noble lord lord walston but i am one who like him does it with great care with youngsters it is true but well supervised <e> <s> i hope that the government will give no undertaking to my noble friend lord stanley about what they will do in future <e> <s> let him be satisfied with the tact that they have gone a long way to meet his point <e> <s> it seems that they have it right <e> <s> let them leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> what my noble friend has said very ably which i do not think the noble lord lord mccarthy has taken account of is that if a man seeks to get his job back and fails he can then get the special award <e> <s> if as is very likely he is say a highly-paid ournalist he does not have to be a journalist he may be a highly paid executive who finds that it would be intolerable for him to go back on account of the conditions of his dismissal and relationship with his colleagues then he is not able to ask for that which if refused would give him the opportunity to get the special award <e> <s> he is then limited to the basic award and the compensatory award <e> <s> there may be cases and i think what my noble friend has said has shown us that there will not be very many but they can be significant where a man is inadequately compensated if he is subject to the limit which is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it he gets the but he cannot get more than a compensatory in addition <e> <s> so it is and our case is that for a highly-paid executive who suffers in this way that may be too little <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by offering my warmest congratulations to the noble baroness lady carnegy for her excellent maiden <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord davies of leek i feel that all the arguments have been adduced and adduced extremely powerfully particularly by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway who i am glad to say has introduced this bill <e> <s> the reason that i have taken some interest in it is that for the best part of my life i have been engaged in working in service industries <e> <s> i was employed for a long time by a very large conglomerate whose name some of your lordships will know and about per cent <e> <s> of whose companies were service companies stretching from passenger transport to entertainments to wembley stadium to plant hire to laundries <e> <s> one could almost say you name the service we have it <e> <s> it is for that reason that i thought that i should take an interest in this bill <e> <s> accordingly in order to bring myself up to date i went to discuss the matter with some of my old friends <e>", "<cs> i want to be very careful not to make a second reading type of speech although really as this is a one-clause bill it is a little difficult to resist the temptation <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and other noble lords were extremely unhappy at second reading about what we regarded as the failure on the part of the government to give adequate or indeed any reasons of substance as to why they could not support this bill <e> <s> one of the central points made in favour of the bill lies in the fact that when eec legislation comes in united kingdom service companies will want to be able to oppose service trade marks from elsewhere but as matters stand they will be unable to do so as they will not be on the register as existing holders <e> <s> that is what the <e>", "<cs> i find this a sensible and important amendment for reasons i shall not rehearse <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to give my fullest support to this bill to denationalise bt <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i certainly agree with him on the first part <e> <s> my support rests not on the relatively narrow grounds of what one might call the failure of the buzby bond initiative and still less i assure your lordships does it rest on a dogmatic belief that all nationalised industries are doomed to stagnation and decay unless they are denationalised <e> <s> i support this bill because as i see it it is one of the most far-sighted bills of this parliament and because i believe that the telecommunications industry is by a long way the greatest growth industry of our time <e> <s> we are only just beginning to perceive the increasing variety of ways by which energy can be harnessed in order among other things to store and transmit information and we are only just beginning to see the growing number of media through which this can be done <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word about this in rather more general terms which means that i shall confine what i say to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not concerned with the way the body is made up <e> <s> i suppose that what we are really discussing is whether an extra ministerial body such as this one should consist of one man as is proposed in the bill and as we find in the case of the director of fair trading or whether we should go right to the other end of the spectrum and there is of course an existing other end of the spectrum and that is the iba where there is a director general who is responsible for nearly all the decisions but who has a chairman and a non-executive board which meets regularly and to which he refers <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord finished or am i interrupting him <e> <s> i realised where i differed from the noble lord when he asked if it would not be prudent to discuss these things with the right people <e> <s> of course it would <e> <s> the noble lord and myself are both businessmen <e> <s> he runs a large professional firm i ran a large industrial undertaking <e> <s> of course we took advice <e> <s> did we not quietly go and have a drink <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i think that he and i have to say that he is not the only one is getting way beyond this particular point of what the dgt does before he decides on the appointment of the members of his regulatory authority <e> <s> the noble lord is ranging over a huge number of questions and it is destroying what could be a very good little debate <e>", "<cs> not this one <e>", "<cs> it seems to me rather surprising that the noble lord should bring forward these two amendments because he gave way on an amendment which so far as i can see dealt with nearly the same principle <e> <s> having said that it appears to me to be quite ridiculous that parliament should have to deal with the salary of one man <e> <s> i cannot think of anything more calculated to waste parliaments time than just to pick one man almost out of a hat just because it is a new job <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> were there not other circumstances attached to his salary which naturally provoked a slightly greater interest <e>", "<cs> my lords before i start i must declare an interest in that i am a director-elect of a cable consortium that has yet to be incorporated and we shall in due course be applying for a franchise <e> <s> before i go on to say what i intend to say i must bring to your lordships attention how disappointed i was with the views that we have just heard from the noble lord lord hill of luton <e> <s> he is a very wise man <e> <s> he is a man who has known all sides of broadcasting and i was greatly disappointed to hear a speech which seemed to be wholly embedded in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given us the benefit of a platitude with which i could not possibly disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder why the noble lord assumes that they will be the plums <e> <s> i had assumed that they would be very much the experimental places <e> <s> i know for a fact that a number of small towns have been picked just because they are small and will produce the answers quickly in microcosm form <e> <s> therefore i suggest that the noble lord may be wrong in thinking that they are the plums <e> <s> not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say in one year <e>", "<cs> i said my lords that that was the forecast <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree with me that particularly in view of the fact that cuba has for many years been an enemy of the western alliance what has been going on in grenada for a long time has been a source of anxiety <e> <s> would she further agree that when grenada or any other of the west indian islands look like turning into a territory that might be at enmity with the west there develops a serious threat to our naval strategy to which the west must have immediate regard <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise to my noble friend for being so anxious to rise previously that i did not give her a chance to reply <e> <s> i should like to put certain questions arising from those i put yesterday <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that the argument in the past few days has left out the great strategic significance of what is going on in the eastern caribbean today <e> <s> does she not agree that it is some years since the united kingdom abdicated in the best sense its responsibility for the defence of the caribbean to the united states government in spite of the fact that by then the united states had left ghaguaramas their big naval base in trinidad <e> <s> would she not agree that a proliferation of small island governments in the eastern caribbean that were of the russian way of thinking would pose a terrible danger to naval ships and supplies coming to us across the atlantic <e> <s> would she agree that no fewer than half the men and supplies from america would come from the southern ports in the gulf of mexico and through the panama canal <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be very brief because it is getting late <e> <s> i have no doubt that this will please the front bench and it will also please my wife who is along the passage waiting for dinner <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to continue this <e> <s> i should perhaps declare my interest <e> <s> it may be

grateful like other noble lords to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for the prayers that he has moved and the very explicit way in which he has dealt with the problem <e> <s> he was good enough to say that he was sorry for the dilemma in which the minister found himself <e> <s> i feel somewhat less sorry for the minister than apparently he does for reasons that i will produce <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he help the house by telling us how much he personally watches television in view of the devastating comments that he has just been making <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble earl how much he watched television in view of the impression he had given that he did not watch it very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by declaring an interest in that i am an executive director in one of the consortia that has recently been chosen to discuss with the government the matters that it is necessary to discuss with a view to concluding a <e>", "<cs> i

that i do not like <e> <s> indeed this matter will be raised a good deal later at this stage in order to try to link the two together <e> <s> we understand very well the difficulty in which the government found themselves <e> <s> i know a great deal about the arguments that have raged in the past three years between these two great departments of state <e> <s> let us say that i understand that it was convenient that the programme side should be part of the home office and that the telecommunications side should be part of the department of industry <e> <s> so i do not have it wrong there <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that i hope that even by implication i did not ask him to think again about the three years <e> <s> i asked him to think again about the suggestions made by my noble friend lord mottistone and to think how he could satisfy us all as to a proper allowance being made for the installation period <e> <s> i should like to think that he has said he will think about these things and for that reason i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> a number of useful suggestions have been made but the discussion has centred around the possible dangers of cross-subsidisation which is not what we want and has not focused sufficiently upon what we are trying to get across that the authority should make up its own mind about how it makes the charges but should seek to go no further than to meet its costs out of the total of the charges <e> <s> nowhere in the bill either in this clause or in clause are we given any assurance that the charges in the aggregate will not turn out to be a global form of levy on the industry to the profit of the government <e> <s> the last subsection in clause refers to any excess of the revenues of the authority going into the consolidated fund <e> <s> to me that is not a safeguard <e> <s> it is a threat <e>", "<cs> it seemed to me that the noble lord lord mishcon had understood the intention of this amendment slightly differently from my understanding of it as to the number of years <e> <s> he said this is perpetual motion you can go on for years and another and another <e> <s> i had understood it it may be that i am wrong and it may be that it would have to be redrafted to achieve it that the intention was to let the initial man who had had it for years go on for another eight years and that would be all <e> <s> if we have failed to do that so be it but it may be something which the government could consider <e>", "<cs> i am most obliged to my noble friend for his offer <e>

am wrong <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord mishcon thumbing very fast through the white paper <e> <s> if i am right will he agree with me that to have a loose rein and that to choose to run the operators on a loose rein is something quite different <e>", "<cs> i have not found the reference but i believe we have dealt with that particular point <e> <s> i have said all that i choose to say on this subject <e> <s> i personally regard this clause as being perfectly adequate and i hope that your lordships will have nothing to do with any of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i believe that there could be something of value in an amendment such as this were it not for the fact that the noble lord includes it in the clause which requires that the authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw attention to a very basic difference between broadcasting and cable <e> <s> first one does not buy broadcasting one buys ones set and listens to or looks at what they give you <e> <s> in the case of cable the market place is there to let the cable operator know whether people like the product or whether they do not <e> <s> that is a fundamental difference <e> <s> secondly i suppose it is open to cable companies to appoint advisory committees to advise them if they want to do so <e> <s> but that is not what the amendment says <e> <s> it says that they shall have these things thrust upon them

impression that the iba is in the position of being <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment as i must i have just one very small parting shot <e> <s> it is quite clear that my noble friend regards the word consult as having an even stronger meaning than i thought <e> <s> he means consult and in the final analysis do what they tell you <e>", "<cs> but we have said everything that could be said <e>", "<cs> that is the burden of the disagreement between us <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my trouble is that i do not know how to define that and we do not get the guidance to do so <e>", "<cs> the very fact that the amendment proposed to take the subsection out altogether should indicate that it was in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> i am more than satisfied with my noble friends explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder what the noble lord lord mishcon has in mind about advertising magazines as they are known <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry i should have said that in moving amendment no <e> <s> i wished to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> this is not a very important question <e> <s> i shall accept the point made by my noble friend that in view of what is earlier stated in clause the powers of the advisory council are already sufficient <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is also the point that each cable channel takes up a great deal more band width than a terrestrial channel <e> <s> indeed it might take up the equivalent of between two and three channels

the fact that it is public service broadcasting <e> <s> those of us who have been in the relay cable business for many years know well that the contractors hate having the area of their market upset

perhaps have said before what i shall say now that during his previous remarks on various amendments it became quite clear to me that he was indeed thinking exactly in terms that i find suitable and exactly in terms of the words of the white paper <e> <s> he has very kindly said that he will have a look at what i said i found wrong and unacceptable about clause and i hope i may accept that <e> <s> on that basis i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord the minister really means me <e>", "<cs> before i make my contribution i must do what i have done before and declare my interest in i think your lordships know what <e> <s> i was interested in the thoughts that the noble lord has had <e> <s> i agree with him that there seems to be a lacuna here and one should think about the halfway house solution while trying to sort things out <e> <s> nevertheless let us remember that during a period of suspension no alternative arrangements can be made <e> <s> you are suspending the public too you are suspending all the customers <e> <s> that perhaps would be the trouble <e> <s> if as the noble lord lord winstanley said there were to be a question of revocation then presumably there would be no lack of continuity in the programmes because the operator would go on until another one had been found and appropriate arrangements had been made so that there was no gap in the programmes nevertheless if we can get over that objection this idea of having a halfway house is interesting and i hope that the government will think about it and we can discuss it further <e>", "<cs> it is very clear from all sides of the committee that there is considerable alarm about this whole business of dual control particularly of a sunrise and high-risk industry into which a lot of money is being put without too much certainty of what will be the outcome <e> <s> my noble friend lord glanusk dealt very concisely with the question of the potential muddle over the granting of a licence <e> <s> i entirely agree <e> <s> but i draw your lordships attention to the fact that this dichotomy of control will run right through the life of the licence and the life of the industry <e> <s> both authorities have power to vary or to modify <e> <s> both have power to terminate either for offences or at the end of the period when the criteria that they might use for granting a new licence could possibly differ <e> <s> in short this is an administrative muddle of a very serious nature <e>", "<cs> i do not want to become involved in semantics but i heard my noble friend say very clearly he emphasised it that this is a dual decision <e> <s> well maybe it is <e> <s> but at that moment i happened to be looking at the wording of the paragraph and i saw the words <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to mention that he started talking about rates and charges and i understand that that is what the amendment is about <e> <s> he then strayed into the provision of broad band services and he seemed to imply that those ought to go right through the country and at that point i failed to follow his argument <e> <s> perhaps he can make quite clear what he was getting at <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend can help us <e> <s> i hope he will be able to tell me that i was wrong but it seemed to me that the statement he made about what is to come later was used to some extent in rebuttal of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> if it was then that is serious because he has used an unknown as an argument <e> <s> perhaps he could help the committee to the advantage of us all by telling me that that was not so and that nor will he be using the fact of his coming statement in rebuttal of any further amendments <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for moving this amendment <e> <s> before i talk to it i must declare my interest as a director of one of the new cable companies <e> <s> i drew attention to the question of dichotomy of control as long ago as the debate on the cable white paper in july and i have talked to it whenever appropriate ever since <e>", "<cs> before the debate comes to an end may i say that i find myself very confused by much that the noble and learned lord has said because for about nine-tenths of his speech he did not appear even to have taken the point about what it is we were asking for <e> <s> he referred constantly to the secretary of state <e> <s> we are asking for it to be written into statute that oftel and the cable authority consult each other on the granting or modification of any licence <e> <s> from hearing the noble and learned lord it seems that between us we have failed to make our point <e>", "<cs> i would not want to press this <e> <s> i think it was dropped because there was developing an ugly political argument with the member for newcastle-under-lyme suggesting that telephone poles were being used for political purposes <e> <s> the only other thing i would say is that one of the reasons for including this is that it is there now in the bill which exists <e> <s> but i do not want to press it <e> <s> having drawn it to the governments attention if they do not feel it worth putting in i am happy to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend for the information that he has given mc <e> <s> i said that i was no expert in the law and i have to admit that i did not know that the law commission was going into this <e> <s> of course he must be right <e> <s> although i would object mildly to the description of ridiculous by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that is not the point that i want to make <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble and learned <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether as i understand it to be it is a fact that this amendment meets the point that he will probably have presumed i was trying to make which was to get the offence extended so that dishonest use of systems applies to cable systems as well as to public telecommunication systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for his helpful reply and although he did not accept it for his kind comments about the technique i have suggested <e> <s> in the course of his remarks he indicated pretty thoroughly that the cable authority will have the right to date the start of a licence forward presumably on the considerations which i have enumerated <e> <s> i am very happy about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for what he said in committee <e> <s> he is right that his suggestion does seem to have been taken on board <e> <s> it will be very helpful to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> i believe that it is as wrong to include as suspect people television contractors and people in the entertainment business who can do so much for cable as long as they do not seek to dominate it as it is right to give the authority the powers to consider every sort of shareholder whoever they may be who might seek to do something contrary to the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support very strongly indeed what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has just said <e> <s> he has put the case brilliantly and in a very wide context <e> <s> all of these arguments have been produced so often <e> <s> indeed the noble lady lady saltoun has said that she has put them three times and i have been saying them ever since july so we are more or less on the same lines <e> <s> what we now need to consider in addition to the legal points is how likely it is that as my noble and learned friend the lord advocate said on the telecommunications bill there will be close co-ordination <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think i can take hope from that <e> <s> at any rate it brings me to the end of what i have to say <e> <s> i would only add that this as i have said before is a high-risk sunrise industry <e> <s> it has to have a lot of confidence within itself and from its backers <e> <s> many of its backers and many of the companies are deeply disturbed by the lack of statutory consultation between their two separate masters <e> <s> i beg my noble friend to help us to put this right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one point to my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that he got himself on to rather delicate ground when he told us that there are certain forms of advertising which go out over the cable systems systems which produce ordinary television-type programmes <e> <s> these are the advertisements that go out in the form of classified or shopping advertisements or even sponsored advertisements <e> <s> particularly in relation to the first two if one form of advertising going out over cable needs to be watched it seems to me very odd that the government should not feel that classified advertisements need the same treatment <e> <s> i fear that this is one of the manifestations of the dual control which we seem to be struggling with all the time <e> <s> a way cannot be found within the delicate balance between the two authorities for the cable authority to do the whole of its duty because surely its duty should be to look at all advertising <e> <s> there is absolutely no logic in saying that some forms of advertising do not need monitoring <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend could help me on that point because i have jumped to my conclusion and may be it is wrong but my conclusion is that this is just one of the weaknesses of the whole structure <e> <s> can my noble friend please help on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only puzzled because i thought i had made myself clear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall try again <e> <s> classified type advertisements of course appear on those television screens which are attached to the cable <e> <s> one can thus switch from programme a which is bbc to programme f the feature film programme or to programme j which is the classified ads programme <e> <s> they all appear on the screen <e> <s> yet the classified ads are not subject to any monitoring whereas the others are <e> <s> i admit that i am taking up my noble friend on a point that he made in reply to my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i apologise if i have gone wide of the point made by my noble friend lord mottistone but i was so surprised to hear that there was this curious gap in the control of advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much doubt whether this is going to happen often enough for it to be right to regard it as a duty on the secretrary of state which is burdensome <e> <s> there will not be many occasions when there is an overlap area <e> <s> let us be quite clear about this <e> <s> it was said in committee i think by the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe that the broadcaster was a public service operator and he therefore had a right to take the decision <e> <s> i pointed out at the time as i am pointing out now that whatever the broadcaster is in terms of public service he is in this for money and he has a marketing area <e> <s> to him his broadcast area is the area in which he markets his investment <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that it is quite wrong that in the ultimate the decision as to which programme should be broadcast should be in the hands of one of the two commercial bodies concerned <e> <s> i fear that this is where the poor secretary of state very often has to come in and do his job to see fair play among two people who are hell bent on making money <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend the chief whip is going to suggest that we do not continue for much longer <e> <s> my amendment which follows this series and a number of other amendments all cover the same subject and i expect that noble lords will agree that the main debate should take place on the amendments of my noble friend <e> <s> if that is the case i am perfectly prepared to defer my remarks until another time if that would suit my noble friend and i could then speak to my amendment while answering him on his amendment <e> <s> if as i understand that is what my noble friend wants it can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak i must once again declare my interest as being a member of a cable consortium <e> <s> it was brought to my attention that i failed to do this last time and in retrospect i would like to apologise to your lordships for what i regard as having been a serious omission <e> <s> i am very grateful as i was before in committee stage to the noble lord lord airedale for the things he has said because he has in a very large measure covered my arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord would give way for a minute <e> <s> he did say then the problem is solved <e> <s> indeed it is not because under the must-carry rules all the cable operator can put out is such i use the word snippets where they are snippets as the broadcaster has time to do <e> <s> it is not solved for him if what he wants to do is to use one of these channels to give the whole thing <e>", "<cs> my lords as i do not intend to move my amendment with the leave of the house i should like to make three brief remarks <e> <s> first in spite of all the help that we have had from my noble friend i want to leave it on record that his amendment falls far short of what the white paper suggested and of what is suggested in my amendment that we believe that my amendment but more importantly the white papers suggestion is absolutely fair and totally protective of broadcasters <e> <s> secondly i take great comfort from the offer that my noble friend has made to have a look at everything that has been said with a view to further consideration at the next stage or even with a view to this matter being dealt with in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend please do the very best he can to give farmers an assurance that the government are sensible of the agonising uncertainty through which the industry is going at the moment <e> <s> perhaps as he has mentioned milk it is all right for me as a dairy farmer to talk specifically about milk <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks from these benches from some of my colleagues who have been helping me on a number of amendments <e> <s> we have enormously appreciated the courtesy we have had from the minister and the help that has come from him and his department <e> <s> we are extremely grateful and we want to say thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend help me by commenting in any way on an announcement that was made on the radio today on london broadcasting to the effect that the prime minister had ordered an inquiry but that the results were not going to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to confine myself to speaking to part i of this bill <e> <s> the reason for that is that i have always believed that if we could achieve secret elections by all members of the trades unions for their executives we should be achieving the most fundamental requirement that is needed in order to improve the working of the trades union movement and its relations with employers and with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend give way for one minute <e> <s> would he be good enough to include the conservative trade unionists in his list of people please <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend please take on board how grateful most of us are that he has come so quickly to this house to make this statement in spite of the obvious fact that he cannot be expected to have any information yet <e> <s> we are delighted that he has come here so fast <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> today when manufacturing industry is still heavily pressed there is a great need for increased profits and more than that for increased capital formation so that industry may do its best to reinvest particularly in places where it is needed <e> <s> it is for that reason that i am interested in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like particularly to thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for his very thoughtful speech <e> <s> we know very well that we are hearing from a trade unionist of great respectability and great expertise <e> <s> we on this side of the committee realise that many of us have not had the experiences which the noble lord and some of his colleagues have had of trade union ballots <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend very much for agreeing in advance to accept the amendment which stands in the names of the noble lord lord rochester and myself and for the gracious way in which he has talked about our efforts <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy gave the game away by saying that he had not had time to cobble together any proper complaints and it was clear from what he said that he had not really reasoned out the objections because it seems as clear as crystal to me that these two amendments go together like a horse and carriage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have done at every stage of the bill i declare my interest as a director of one of the interim consortia <e> <s> all i should like to do is to thank my noble friend for what the government have done <e> <s> he has been very explicit about the main reason why they have done it <e> <s> apart from that for all the reasons that we adduced from committee stage onwards this will be of enormous help to this budding but very high risk industry <e> <s> once again i thank the government for what they have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government for all the help they have given on amendments nos <e> <s> and which the noble lord will remember were hotly debated during the committee and report stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have come close to dealing with what i was asking for at all stages <e> <s> i also believe that the noble lord has by what he has just said satisfied me on the one point on which i was in doubt which is what happens when for various reasons the broadcasters decide not to broadcast something for which cable rights have been acquired <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this amendment which deals with some important principles <e> <s> i shall go no further because it has been so well argued than to say that i hope that my noble friend at the least will say that he can take this amendment away and have a thorough look at it <e> <s> it certainly deserves it <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord rodney i too have to declare an interest as a director of portals holdings <e> <s> lest your lordships should think that portals is badly in need of succour from this decision <e> <s> perhaps i should add that that is very far from being the case <e> <s> the loss of the note will scarcely be noticed except in slightly different delivery dates <e> <s> therefore i ask your lordships to accept that i am capable of taking a totally objective view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that he did not mind my taking him up on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the tripartite discussion between the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords when i heard that i thought of putting it up higher but i decided that i would stick to the existing figure <e> <s> i contend that if this succeeds in that it encourages many more people to take part-time jobs in so far as the taxpayer is concerned it would be at exactly neutral cost <e> <s> i know that one can argue the other way but i argue strongly that it would be of nil cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to accept that <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord mottistone in what he has just said <e> <s> the reason is this <e> <s> i am quite sure that my noble friend lord lucas will find himself in considerable difficulty with his department <e> <s> he has shown himself to be commendably understanding of our point of view but we cannot possibly run the risk that we withdraw the amendment and he comes up with something which the department has written for him and which is totally inadequate when we might then find it very difficult under the rules of this house to return to the matter <e> <s> therefore i agree with my noble friend lord mottistone that we must ask him to be specific when he comes to reply now <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that recently the essex university students union voted against a motion condemning the brighton bombing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word in strong support of the noble lord <e> <s> lord mottistone <e> <s> the way that my noble friend has been talking and i do not want to go into some of the technical details convinces me that the government are not paying sufficient attention to the need to have directors take risks on behalf of young companies <e> <s> this is particularly tragic in the light of another part of the governments determination to help young companies get under way <e> <s> had my noble friend been able to express some greater sympathy with this aspect of the matter we would feel less unhappy about the line that the government are so clearly taking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by adding my congratulations to those of other noble lords to my noble friend lord vinson on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that we shall have many more <e> <s> i am delighted to find that my noble friend is like me and some other speakers a farmer a vat-free farmer so of course together we wept for the plight of my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton which he so passionately described <e>", "<cs> it sounds as though my noble friend the minister is being pulled in a number of directions <e> <s> indeed in one important way i think that he is being pulled in one direction because he has been told by every noble lord who has spoken so far that the one thing that they do not want is for the highway and traffic power to be left with the districts <e> <s> indeed three separate suggestions have been put forward <e> <s> i therefore hope that when my noble friend comes to answer he will at least at one stage do his best to sweep all those suggestions together and to treat them as one although they have a negative element and tell us why he thinks that district authorities are adequate to deal with highways and traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords the intent of this bill is set out extremely succinctly in the last two lines of the introduction to the white paper on page <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> it is plumstead episcopi <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord peyton seems to me to be reading a great deal more into the intentions behind this amendment than is proper <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that this is an amendment asking for flexibility so that the very varying conditions that there are in the various authorities can be taken into account and the extent of their difficulties and the paperwork involved in registering services sympathetically looked at <e> <s> that is so that there can be agreement that in some places the deregulation date should be varied <e> <s> as i see it there is no suggestion in this amendment that there should be a variable date <e> <s> i think there is a rule that the date holds but that there can be exception to it if the local authority can show to the ministers satisfaction that the public would be gravely disadvantaged if the minister forced it to stick to a timetable to which it could not adhere particularly that part of the timetable that deals with the findings of operators to run tendered routes that have been abandoned by the network on a specific day <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for moving this amendment <e> <s> it has my name to it because i believe it to be an amendment of the most fundamental importance <e> <s> let me at the start say my piece warned perhaps by what my noble friend lord nugent said about the last amendment about whether or not it is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> however before giving your lordships my reasons i would ask you to accept my assurances that had i believed it to be a wrecking amendment it would not have had my name attached to it nor would i be speaking to it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has been talking much about the trial areas and about hereford in particular <e> <s> i think one point that none of us has taken is that these trial areas were not designed to be trial areas for the purposes of what is now envisaged <e> <s> the main thing that we had in hereford was that other operators were allowed to come in and run routes but that is only part of this package which we call deregulation <e> <s> it does not deal with the effect of the removal of subsidies from the networks <e> <s> it does not deal with the efficacy of the tender system <e> <s> so it is really only one-third of a trial and to that extent whether the bit that they did succeeded is partly irrelevant because the nature and purpose of the trial was so incomplete in terms of the purpose behind this bill <e>", "<cs> this is a sensible and important amendment <e> <s> the only point i would add is that the noble lord lord shepherd has very properly majored on the safety factor and on the need to have a first class maintenance staff of the right size <e> <s> do not let us forget however all the other things that are being thrust on the traffic commissioners <e> <s> the registrations of services will be a tremendous burden both to start with and thereafter <e> <s> there will be a constant flow of new people requiring operators licences <e> <s> they have to be investigated <e> <s> it is because of those factors too that i support the sense and almost totally the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> as might be expected my noble friend lord peyton has said everything there is to be said in the most remarkably short time <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to him for covering both these amendments in a way of which i fully approve <e> <s> i think we can all agree whatever arguments we have had up till now that new competition coming into this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that he will take away my amendment and look at it despite the qualifications that he made <e> <s> if it is of any help to him i can tell him that i too am more concerned with the first part of my amendment than the second <e> <s> it is in the first part that there is reference to the would-be operators financial standing <e> <s> if my noble friend will think of it in those terms for myself i shall be satisfied <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord shepherd has said and to what has been said by my noble friend the minister and also by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> my noble colleague lord shepherd so far as i could tell was pointing out to us more than anything else the dangers of the gaps that would emerge immediately because of the withdrawal of cross-subsidy and possibly because of other reasons when the networks that his bus companies have operated were forced to cut down their mileage by up to per cent <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent has countered that and said there is no danger because i believe and i daresay it is almost a mystic belief that this void will be filled by the operation of this noble word competition <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it is about the least that one can do and it is essential that this should be done <e> <s> we have to devise methods of making absolutely sure that the public have ready access to these traffic regulations as and when they come out <e> <s> for the traffic authority to send those to the local authority and for it to have to make them available to the public is the least that could happen for the sake of the travelling public <e>", "<cs> i have consistently during this bill laboured the point that one of the great dangers is that there would not be enough money available either to the shire counties or to the authorities in the conurbations to subsidise services on the scale which might be needed <e> <s> but at the same time and this may surprise my noble friend i have not been convinced that commercial competition on would-be tendered routes is anything like the danger that people have suggested <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before he replies my noble friend will allow me to make a few remarks on what has been said by certain noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord peyton suggested that i had painted a macabre picture <e> <s> i do not think it was at all <e> <s> there is going to be a considerable rush and a considerable strain on the traffic staff <e> <s> anybody <e>", "<cs> i would rather finish my sentence if i may <e>", "<cs> no i do not agree with my noble friend lord mottistone either <e> <s> he has put me off my stride and that will take an extra couple of minutes to put right <e> <s> whatever the force of lord beloff s arguments he made them i fear without proper study of clause and that is not like him <e>", "<cs> i think i made it clear towards the end of my speech that i was asking for this principle to be accepted <e> <s> in fact what i suppose i was really saying indeed i did say it but perhaps not strongly enough was that i thought the government were quite wrong to remove clause and that that or something like it embodying those principles should be reinstated <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for the way in which he puts a punch into the points i made <e> <s> i think he probably put the arguments a great deal clearer than i did <e> <s> at least i hope that noble lords are clearer about these esoteric problems than they were when we started some minutes ago <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend says his final piece perhaps i may say that it was clear to me that the government felt really nervous about this subsection d <e> <s> they seemed really to feel that it would inhibit small operators from coming in <e> <s> i took the view that this was really taking their new doctrine to an extreme which was almost ridiculous <e> <s> we know that the provision of the kind of vehicle into which at least the ambulatory disabled can enter exists to some extent but it will be a long time before vehicles with underfloor engines and therefore high floors and three steps up will disappear <e> <s> in due course we shall probably influence the manufacturers to act on this and so the time will come when the lot of the majority of the disabled is very much better <e> <s> but when they say that the clause goes too far because it might interfere with this precious policy of deregulation it seems to me that the government are almost making fools of themselves in their obsessive regard for sticking so tightly to their bill that they refuse even a clause such as this <e>", "<cs> for all the reasons which the noble lord lord mcintosh has put forward so well i too am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for putting this on the record <e> <s> it is right that it should be there and we may well return to it <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord carmichael does very well to point out the need for some mechanism which does not appear to be in the bill in order to enable the commercial and the non-commercial services to mesh in with each other <e> <s> i can see in this amendment nothing but a helpful suggestion <e> <s> the local authority traffic departments have immense knowledge of the routes that are currently being run and i should have thought that operators and traffic commissioners would have benefited enormously from the early statements in detail of their views the map as the noble lord lord carmichael says <e> <s> because it is an early statement surely it means that difficulties which might otherwise arise or gaps which might occur will be pre-empted by the existence of this map and by the ability of local authorities the traffic commissioner to talk with operators about their plan so that as near as possible we get a smooth operation right from the start <e>", "<cs> i can see why my noble friend has some doubts but may i put these two points to her <e> <s> first this is a guide prepared for all operators of the totality of services which the local authority thinks ought to be run and it is prepared as i see it without taking a view one way or the other as to what sort of operator is to run a service <e> <s> as applications for registration come in the map is so to speak marked up and the gaps emerge which can be the subject of fruitful conversations <e> <s> but there is no compulsion nor <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way <e>", "<cs> my noble friend wagged his finger at me as he referred to subsection forgetting perhaps that i had referred him to it <e> <s> i said right at the beginning that i have some doubts about subsection <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right because in the final analysis that would happen <e> <s> my commendation of this clause was clearly qualified by the fact that i did not find that acceptable but i do find acceptable the pre-publishing of a map and all the voluntary mechanism that goes with it <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble lord lord mcintosh said <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment achieves in practice a good deal of what the last amendment sought to achieve and as he gave us its purpose with great lucidity i shall not repeat it <e> <s> i really think that there can be no complaint here on the score of the complaint which was made from this side of the committee about a <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we do not want to get too far into schedule debates but a couple of dates are perhaps worth adding to show how acute the time factor is <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carmichael said d-day will be september th <e> <s> perhaps a high proportion of applications for registration will be in the early part of the year but throughout the spring and summer they will be coming in <e> <s> indeed the last date is to be october th <e> <s> perhaps noble lords will bear that in mind when they think of the final d-day being september th <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend one particular question <e> <s> in the middle of his excellent exposition he said that this might go on for years <e> <s> i wondered why he said that because if he looks at the last three lines of subection of the amendment he will find reference to the substitution of <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome this amendment moved so well by my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that those of us who have paid attention to the progress of this bill through both houses should remember that constantly during the course of debates ministers have given assurances that there would not be blank spots appearing on d-day or soon after because there was in existence this roll grant provisional for four years which would see that any of these little holes are adequately filled <e> <s> that is why i am so concerned about what we were told by my noble friend as to the way in which the grant is to be handed out <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will give way for a moment <e> <s> i did not say it was wrong <e> <s> i said that that was likely to happen and by definition it would be wasting some of this very valuable money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps in saying a few words i can put the mind of my noble friend lord belstead at rest about the possibility that i have not made myself fully aware of the contents of the discussions that took place while i was in san francisco <e> <s> i assure him that immediately i left the aeroplane jet lagged as i was i was at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in this amendment because i played some part in the decision of your lordships to change this clause quite substantially at committee stage <e> <s> as with the other amendment which we discussed a little earlier i read this very carefully i saw what your lordships had done by way of changing the clause again and came to the conclusion that it had been very substantially improved because to be honest i thought that in one or two ways the original amendment overdid it a little <e> <s> so i am quite happy with the clause as it stands <e> <s> i hate having to rat on my noble friend but on the basis if nothing else that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done perhaps it is better not to give the operator these rights <e> <s> i am sure that he will make his views known anyhow <e> <s> so i suggest that we leave the matter as it is and do not amend the bill in this say <e>", "<cs> my lords i nearly gasped when i heard the words very clear from my noble friend <e> <s> i thought that he went into the most extraordinary attempts at obfuscation in his answer <e> <s> he gave what to me was a highly political departmental-type cautious reply about someting that in commercial terms is absolutely obvious <e> <s> there will almost certainly be spare buses available the noble lord lord carmichael made this point very clearly to those would-be operators who will be short of capital but will need to acquire good buses for their use in order to run their new businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i cannot accept that <e> <s> i would not have risen if i had not read the matter with extreme care <e> <s> my noble friend should know better <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is not out of order may i on my noble friends behalf thank the government for their courtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords before i begin to offer my thanks perhaps i can refer to something which the noble lord lord tordoff said <e> <s> he said that there had been criticism that those in opposition had not produced an alternative plan <e> <s> in fact i have here an eight-page document headed briefing note <e>", "<cs> perhaps not my lords <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> i should like to say how much i enjoyed working with the noble lords lord carmichael and lord tordoff <e> <s> i may not call them my noble friends but i should like to say that call them my friends <e> <s> i now have two new friends and very agreeable to me it is <e> <s> i have much enjoyed working with them <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be brief <e> <s> i ask my noble friend when he comes to reply which i am sure will be straightaway to give the committee special help on one aspect of the discussion <e> <s> it has seemed to me that every noble lord who has spoken has agreed with widdicombe that the test is the content of the material and that only <e> <s> but those who have opposed the amendment have asked why should not the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by declaring an interest in that i am a director of one of the new cable companies <e> <s> i should like to go on and say how delighted i was with the maiden speech by my noble friend lord chilston <e> <s> it was particularly pleasant for me <e> <s> having spent much of my life in a trade closely relating to broadcasting i recognised not a fellow traveller but a fellow human being and he seemed to address the house with some good hard business sense which commanded my full approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think there is really very much at issue between us <e> <s> i believe we look at it in very much the same way <e> <s> i shall be extremely interested to hear what the government have to say to us about their view <e>", "<cs> let me say how disappointed i was in my noble friends reply <e> <s> i expected her to say that the government at least thought that it was a good idea to have somebody in every school who was trained in first aid even if there were cogent reasons why that could not be done <e> <s> it seemed to me that she was diligent to avoid such an opinion <e> <s> she suggested that under certain circumstances it may be better not to have somebody because they would be worried about having to fulfil their duty even perhaps while the ambulance was coming <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak about the bill for only a couple of minutes because i want then to range over wider aspects of farming <e> <s> i can give a cautious welcome to the provisions that enable adas to make charges <e> <s> i say cautious because i am concerned as i am sure my noble friend is to see that it is not thereby dispersed as it is a body with considerable skill and experience <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that we suspect that the leaders of those cults come from overseas will the noble lord the minister tell us whether there are many known cases of such people having broken the immigration acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise very much with my noble friend in this <e> <s> like the noble lord lord john-mackie i should like to give assurances to members of adas who i know from my own experience are feeling most insecure <e> <s> i am about to make a great deal more use of adas than i have in the past knowing that it is going to cost me money <e> <s> i have a large number of cows and i know exactly what i want adas to do for me and it is bound to be worth my while <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in the past few minutes he has tempted me very much <e> <s> i am a tenant <e> <s> i am the tenant of my six year-old grandson <e> <s> i spend a lot of my time resenting every penny that i pay to the little blighter <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> i should like to enter this debate for the first time to welcome what my noble friend has <e>", "<cs> there are some of us who remember only recently a schedule that was pages long <e> <s> we want to be careful that we shall not have something which is so nice that the law becomes complex <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to give my strongest support to my noble friends amendment <e> <s> he has argued it with great knowledge and in great depth and all it needs is for me to suggest to the committee that there is in many ways a negation here of natural justice <e> <s> an inspector may go and look at a building deliberately without the owner knowing and knowledge of what happens after that right up until the building has been listed by the minister is kept from the owner <e> <s> the nub of these amendments seems to me to be a demand that the owner should know before the minister decides to list the building and should have a statutory right of appeal <e> <s> there is the statutory right to list and it seems quite wrong that a statutory right should not exist on the other side <e>", "<cs> we should be grateful to my noble friend for the offer he has made to have another look at this matter and to have discussions on it <e> <s> the central point lies in the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment because as my noble friend said it covers non-violent means that can be effectively used to stop a man going about his lawful business <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned stopping a lorry <e> <s> i was going to mention and will a group of people who surround say a chicken battery or a breeder shed in order to make it difficult for people to get in store the animals and feed them and generally make it harder for the work at the farm to go on <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend when talking about agricultural produce mentioned milk and beef but so far as i can remember he did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i too start by congratulating my noble and learned friend on the helpful and extremely lucid way in which he introduced this bill <e> <s> i shall confine myself largely to part i which i fully support and then say a little about part ii to conclude <e> <s> i am in fact rather glad that i decided not to talk about part iii because i did so without knowing that the noble lord lord williams was going to lead for the opposition <e> <s> he will recall that many years ago when he was running the prices and incomes board <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords the price commission <e> <s> i was running a national television rental business and the noble lord chased me all round the houses in making a report on the industry <e> <s> i am happy to say that by a hairsbreadth he failed to catch me but i fear i would not be so lucky another time <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the point that it would put small people out of business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> did not the association also express that view on the assumption that the bill would remain as it is with this particular defence still included <e>", "<cs> my lords is that the end of my pounding <e>", "<cs> with respect i think the noble lord has put it succinctly and he is also very practical <e> <s> we know that much of this bill is to catch the rascals there are <e> <s> to say that one can rely on the conscience of a company is no answer certainly no answer in law <e> <s> it is not a legalistic question because when the chips are down it is and will be very practical <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i shall read carefully what he has said in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> may i make one point that only a layman would see and it may not apply to the courts <e> <s> in the second line of clause there is a reference to <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in all these amendments but in particular in his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i drew attention on second reading to problems about the word safety although i said that i was a layman and i wondered how it could be turned into sufficiently absolute terms if necessary to send a man to gaol <e> <s> now here in this subsection and i had that in mind when i made the reference at second reading we get safety in a special relative sense <e> <s> we get the word safer <e> <s> safer than what <e> <s> safer than the other chap who is selling something and is he selling it at the same price <e> <s> safer than any particular standard <e> <s> these are things which we surely ought to know if we are to judge a man to have committed a criminal offence <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend did not think of any answer because i very much hope that the government themselves will take the sense of what he said and think of something a good deal more precise than we find in this subsection <e>", "<cs> may i raise one point with my noble friend <e> <s> he has given a definition of how the word safer should be interpreted <e> <s> i understand from what he said that the safety officer may take the view that a particular product is not safe enough because it could have been made safer provided it did not cost more to an unreasonable extent <e> <s> i think that is what he said <e> <s> if i have that wrong i should be grateful to be told because it is an important point <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government do not accept the amendment <e> <s> i have great sympathy with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> in many cases it is clearly a shame that we export unsafe goods <e> <s> as she rightly says that will probably do our reputation no good <e> <s> but we must have regard to what we are about tonight we are discussing acts which may become criminal <e> <s> if we take that as the context we are in the business of protecting our population <e> <s> the criminal law cannot be extended to protect the population of the whole world <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for the extremely generous way in which he has listened to the arguments that have been put forward by the noble lord lord gallacher and argued so brilliantly if i may say so by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for the trouble that he has taken to answer me as fully as he can <e> <s> i am possibly a little more optimistic than the noble lord lord williams of elvel so i can now tell him that i shall be coming back at report stage to find out how the government are getting on <e> <s> believe me i do not underestimate the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i join my noble friend in congratulating the noble lord lord porritt on his robust defence of the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> let us all be quite clear that if we want research into such things as cancer arthritis aids and so on we have to allow the industry to spend enormous sums of money on it <e> <s> if we permitted this amendment to go through we would by definition be saying you are not protected as in our opinion you should be <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the noble baroness is quite right in seeking to take out the word cost <e> <s> i referred to the matter at second reading when i was talking about the anti-skid device on an expensive car as opposed to no device on a cheaper car <e> <s> i believe that it will require the judge to take into account a whole new dimension and that it will be extremely difficult for him to do so <e> <s> i believe that the whole matter would be much simpler if reference to the word cost was not there <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendments of the noble lord lord gallacher and i should like very briefly to tell your lordships why i agree so strongly with the concordat that certain of the provisions in the draft code should come out and go into regulations under clause and so become i shall not put it technically part of the law with the code thereafter in a redrafted form serving only as guidance <e> <s> i shall not try to guide your lordships as to the exact evidential form it should take other than to say that i agree with the noble and learned lord lord denning that i rather wish it was not there at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for the trouble that he has taken over the many questions which i put to him and for the clarity of his answer <e> <s> having said that i must say that it is a little bit like the curates egg <e> <s> so far as the a is concerned i think that what the minister had to say was encouraging <e> <s> however i cannot quite understand what is so difficult about hastings east which leaves the bottleneck <e> <s> i hope that the government will change their view on that and hurry it up <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that particularly in view of what has been said about the choice of chairman this house and this country owe an enormous debt of gratitude to sir george jefferson for the work he did during the very difficult and complex time when he was in the chair and started the company on its new role <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend to help me concerning the words in brackets in subsection <e> <s> whatever he finally chooses to do perhaps he can agree with me when i suggest removing the negatives so that the subsection reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to use the description that was used by the noble lord lord walston and say that i regard this as a useful bill and potentially moderately important <e> <s> in the time that i shall allow myself i should like to talk about only one aspect and that is the question of farm woodlands <e> <s> i want specifically to deal with clause b <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> the noble baroness will recall i am sure that i said myself that it was experimental <e> <s> it may work <e> <s> that does not matter <e> <s> i gave it a welcome at the beginning and at the end <e>", "<cs> it is important that in farming debates we take the opportunity to raise those subjects that seem to be the most important <e> <s> the question of de-intensification is certainly in everyones mind and i am sure that it is in the governments mind <e> <s> we know that certain proposals will come from the commission <e> <s> i look forward as will other noble lords to knowing the governments thinking in this respect <e> <s> i believe that we should spare my noble friend from having even to consider accepting the amendment <e> <s> the timing is wrong although the timing of the debate is first class and we should not ask her to go further than giving us some useful thoughts from the government <e>", "<cs> i should like to express regret that my noble friend has seen fit to introduce this somewhat acid argument into what has hitherto been a useful and friendly discussion <e> <s> that said i shall not pursue it or the reasons for it <e> <s> i remind the committee that the bill is concerned not with charity or pity for farmers but with voluntary set-aside of one kind or another <e> <s> we are trying to induce farmers to do something that will be in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boardman for introducing this debate and for giving me an opportunity to address the house for the first time <e> <s> i must tell the house that i have just enjoyed an excellent lunch in your lordships refreshment room where i was mistaken for a waiter <e> <s> i am in fact a stockbroker <e> <s> but having just seen the level of the <e>"]
