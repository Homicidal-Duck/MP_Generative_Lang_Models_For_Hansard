["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply most of which i did not understand may i ask him whether the directive is a definition of the functions of parliament in medieval times <e> <s> has not the function of parliament been completely transformed in the th century and in this century as illustrated in our debate on the gracious speech dealing with economic social and international affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate and welcome the minister on his first reply in his post to questions <e> <s> may i ask him this was there not general agreement at the recent conference on most issues promising a solution at the revised conference in new york in july <e> <s> was not the most controversial question that of seabed mining <e> <s> would the government indicate to us their view of the two unresolved problems the financing of the international authority and the transference of technology to it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm whether at the conference the united states delegate indicated that the united states would be taking unilateral action by authorising private companies to exploit seabeds <e> <s> even though they said that they would conform with an international convention would not this give american companies an unfair advantage over other companies in advancing their proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the question put to the minister from the government benches may i ask whether it is not a fact that the first invasion was by uganda into tanzania as would be endorsed by the high commission in nairobi <e> <s> furthermore in view of the poverty of tanzania quite apart from military action ought not this government to give more aid to that country in seeking to build its new society <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this debate has proved two things first that although foreign affairs and defence are related we need separate days to discuss them and secondly that when noble lords put down their names to speak they should indicate their subject so that we might have some sequence in the debate <e> <s> i apologise to the noble earl lord lauderdale that i shall not be following him but that is an indication how the debate is spoilt because there is not sequence in the discussions <e>", "<cs> certainly and i have often done so <e> <s> in view of the vast superiority of the soviet union and of the united states of america the existence in this country of nuclear weapons is just trivial in any war situation <e> <s> in addition it is a threat to all our people <e> <s> if war occurred and we had these nuclear weapons great britain would be one of the first targets for the soviet union to attack and soviet missiles could destroy the whole of our population <e> <s> i want to ask her majestys government whether they will agree not to proceed with further missiles in this country before salt iii has been able to discuss this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say this <e> <s> the great difference is that now we have all the governments of the world pressing for disarmament <e> <s> it is no longer utopian idealism or romanticism it is now realism <e> <s> there has been the special assembly of the united nations followed by the committee in geneva which is now working out these problems with practical proposals before it <e> <s> what i am asking is that our government should seize this opportunity <e> <s> if the soviet union is insincere put it to the test <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to the provisions of the helsinki agreement <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the major section of the helsinki agreement was concerned with economic co-operation and integration and can he report on the progress which has been made in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords looking realistically at the future and in view of the uncertain stability of the interim government because of the divisions within it and the disproportionate strength of mr ian smith is not the only solution if one is to be reached to find a means by which there will be discussions not only within zimbabwe but with the patriotic front and the front-line governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply and congratulating him upon his appointment may i ask whether while individuals have met it is not desirable that there should be a meeting with the highly representative action committee which includes all the doctors all the staff the six trade unions involved and the south camden community health authority <e> <s> is not further <e>", "<cs> my lords while on this rare occasion welcoming the attitude of the government rather than that of my own front bench may i ask the noble lord this question is it the intention to keep the hospital closed for three years <e> <s> meanwhile will the doctors at the university college hospital where wards are being opened for them be women doctors treating women if they so desire <e> <s> will the voluntary fund which is to be used be under the surveillance of the staff so that they can be sure that it will be used for need rather than money <e>", "<cs> my lords not wishing to prejudice the present discussions may i ask whether the noble lord has noted the statement of president carter in the usa in which he said that while there was a majority election the constitution was only submitted in a referendum to the whites and that the majority of the election was not about the constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming both the statement made by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the ministers present reply may i ask the noble lord this question has he seen the evidence which the board of visitors not a very radical organisation has given to the may commission about pentonville prison <e> <s> has he noted their statement that six prisoners unconvicted have been there for between and months and that eight deportees not charged with any offence have been there for three months <e> <s> does he agree with them that this is shameful and a poor advertisement for british justice <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this further question <e> <s> what is being done to apply the principles which he has expressed <e> <s> is a circular to be issued urging that courts should sit longer and more often in order that they may deal with these questions more rapidly <e> <s> would it not be desirable that it should be an exception that prisoners on remand should be sent to prison <e> <s> if deportees have to be detained surely they can be detained otherwise than in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great importance of any bill for citizenship in this country and the great interest in this problem as indicated by the noble lords reply would it be possible for the government to issue either a green paper or a white paper of their views so that there might be public consideration before the bill is introduced <e> <s> we now have no idea what the proposals of the government are <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join with the spokesman for the government and for the opposition front bench in my very best wishes to the or people of the gilbertese and ellice islands on moving toward their independence <e> <s> they will have a difficult and exciting task <e> <s> they will represent different islands over an area of million square miles <e> <s> i am confident they will prove equal to the task <e> <s> they <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment at committee stage would be to exclude ocean island from the clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest that the banabans proposed that <e> <s> i said that the prime minister of fiji had proposed it and that they had accepted it <e> <s> i have got in detail the proposals which the prime minister of fiji made and they included foreign affairs <e> <s> and the banabans did accept those proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> i said that the prime minister of fiji had suggested that they should not control foreign affairs <e> <s> as an associate state that would be in the hands of the gilbertese <e> <s> it is that that the banabans accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the absence of the assurance for which i asked i shall be moving the amendment at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the very great contribution which the government have made in public housing may i ask whether it is the case that because of the growth of population this problem is especially severe in hongkong <e> <s> have not rents in many cases increased by per cent <e> <s> in a year and in a few years will they not be times higher <e> <s> in view of the fact that rent control is ending this year is not an inquiry necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister know that i am the first to congratulate the hong kong government on their housing programme <e> <s> but is it not the case that the present rent control <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to oppose this motion but i shall be making suggestions during the committee stage which i hope will lead to reconsideration <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> has not the situation completely changed since we discussed this matter three weeks ago by the discussions at the suva negotiations where the banabans have accepted the overall sovereignty of the gilbertese <e> <s> would not the acceptance of this amendment facilitate negotiations which could be completed before th july <e>", "<cs> i am unconvinced and will press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that very full reply may i ask him this while one recognises that many of the governments are themselves responsible for the gulf between riches and poverty is there not a need as suggested by the chairman the leader of the netherlands delegation for the industrialised nations to contribute <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a great danger <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question from the front bench may i ask the minister whether he will look rather deeper into this question <e> <s> is it not the case that this mural painting won national recognition as a work of art and was it not very desirable that this artist and the local people who co-operated with him should seek to beautify the area rather than that the kind of slogans which are so often put on walls should be found there <e> <s> will not the minister look at the issue in that wider context <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister not only for that reply but for the very full letter which i have received today but i ask him whether the labour governments proposals did not include negotiations with the objective of reducing and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons instituting nuclear-free zones in the world and the prohibition of chemical and radiological weapons <e> <s> are these not very radical proposals and can we have an assurance that her majestys government will support them at the geneva committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in the dark as to what is happening at the geneva committee <e> <s> can the minister give us any detailed account of the progress which has been made in these disarmament proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord been able to study the figures published this morning which <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating that the noble lord has had those discussions may i ask whether they give promise that there will be a renewal of dialogue with the western five and do they hold out hope that there may be an election under united nations supervision in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a danger unless these discussions evolve hopefully that the unrecognised national assembly in namibia may adopt legislative powers and that the south african administrator-general may have executive powers which he is now using with great draconian authority <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from that reply would it not be possible to resolve this problem by asking that both swapo and south african troops should be restricted to their bases pending an election <e>", "<cs> my lords to what extent do the wages councils which my noble friend lord shinwell and i helped mary mcarthur establish years ago cover all the homeworkers today who are now spread over a much larger area than they were when the wages councils were established <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i am getting a little older and a little deaf <e> <s> i did not quite hear the point which the minister was making <e> <s> i hope that as i proceed i shall deal with it <e> <s> i want to admit at once that some advances have been made <e> <s> the most extraordinary advance is the agreement by the united nations general assembly to establish an economic authority equal to the political authority <e> <s> that economic authority would control per cent <e> <s> of the activities of the united nations and more than billion dollars of its development funds <e> <s> i have given rather short notice to the minister but i ask him for some information about the development of the new economic authority at the united nations as we have had little information about it <e> <s> there is undoubtedly some suspicion that there has been obstruction of its implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this quite extraordinary <e> <s> not only was the decision reached that this economic authority should be established but a director was appointed and has been serving <e> <s> yet here we are with the government unable to give us any information whatsoever about what has happened to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> is it not the case that this is a highly respected multiracial school with a very large proportion of the children holding faiths other than that of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is it not the case that through pakistani agencies a firm at swansea had made two deliveries of uranium to pakistan before the department of energy made any inquiries as to its use for military nuclear purposes <e> <s> is it not also the case that there is a factory in cheshire financed by an international consortium called urenco from whose dutch plant plans have been sent to pakistan has not the united states now stopped aid for this project and will our government do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the statement in another place that there is to be a tripartite arrangement between west germany the netherlands and this country to control classified materials may i ask the minister whether he regards that as adequate when there is now concern that pakistan may be developing a hydrogen bomb as well as an atom bomb which might be used in a war in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him this question does the agreement between vietnam and the united nations high commissioner for refugees amount to an arrangement by which the vietnamese may leave if they have homes or families abroad or if they have an intention of livelihood <e> <s> has hanoi accepted the proposal to come to the conference where it is proposed that priority should be given to a discussion by which this agreement might be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lords statement that the problem is much more complex but i disagree with some of those who say that the sole responsibility is in vietnam <e> <s> the conference is to be for only two days <e>", "<cs> my lords it is appropriate that i should succeed the noble marquess lord salisbury in his speech <e> <s> he has followed the tradition of his great ancestor <e> <s> he will not expect me to agree with the arguments that he has put forward but the value of these debates is that different views can be expressed and it is one of the glories of our country that by such discussion we have reached decisions finally <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming what the minister has said about the present arrangements and the new proposals which have been made may i ask whether he will agree that this issue of human rights is now of paramount importance and this not only applies to the soviet union but to many countries in the world even among our old allies <e> <s> will her majestys government bring greater pressure to bear in order to secure the carrying out of the helsinki agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that however modernised these forces would be insignificant compared with those of the soviet union and the united states of america and would have no effect at all if war occurred <e> <s> would they not be an invitation to an enemy to bomb the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will pay special attention to this proposal is it not a fact that a great deal of our grants to these countries goes to an lite through governments and never gets to the poorer sections of the community <e> <s> is it not possible to make it a condition of these grants that they should go to the great majority of rural workers and their very successful co-operatives <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the conference is to last for only two days and has to deal with an enormous problem of the resettlement of the boat people can the minister give us an assurance that the british contribution will prevent the conference being hogged down over political differences about responsibilities on which there arc different views and that it will really address itself to the humanitarian problem of dealing with the condition of these people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether simultaneously her majestys government are co-operating with the restructured committee on disarmament at geneva set up by the united nations special assembly for multinational disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i gave notice of my intention to speak too late to the chief whip for my name to be recorded on the list of speakers but i have given notice to the minister that i wished to speak <e> <s> we will all feel that the noble marquess lord salisbury and my noble friend lord paget of northampton are deeply concerned about this question and have spoken with great sincerity about their anxieties <e> <s> i venture to take part in the debate only because i have been in zambia this year and because i have some knowledge of the attitude of those who may be concerned if there were any dangers to her majesty when she goes to zambia <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the decision of the geneva conference regarding the treatment of exiles from vietnam may i ask whether her majestys government would reconsider their decision if that agreement was implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether it is not now clear that the first invasion of tanzania was by uganda <e> <s> would that not be confirmed by our high commissioner in nairobi <e> <s> is it not the case that it had cost tanzania million and that it is asking for only million from nine different western governments <e> <s> in view of the act of liberation which has been carried out in uganda should we not make a response to this invitation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask her majestys government the question of which i have given private notice namely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very full statement <e> <s> is he aware that despite political differences we would wish to express appreciation of the prime minister in initiating this conference which has had such valuable results <e> <s> is it not the case that dr waldheim the united nations secretary-general in effect saved this conference when it was in danger of political controversy and has not the status of the united nations been greatly enhanced by the service which he and the commissioner for refugees gave to the conference <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we desire to express our tribute to the island of the philippines and to indonesia for providing transit accommodation to the refugees and particularly to hong kong which has in a humanitarian way received the refugees at a cost of million a year <e> <s> will the government be making some contribution to hong kong to meet that cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the visit of sir james murray to pretoria next month may i ask whether there is not a danger of the situation deteriorating within namibia as illustrated by the decision yesterday of the nationalist party to oppose any end to racial discrimination <e> <s> could not the two points at issue be solved if the south african forces and the swapo forces were both restricted to their bases pending and during an election under united nations auspices <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister note the unanimous decision by the organisation for african unity including the moderate governments in africa that any recognition of this interim government would be regarded as hostile action towards africa as a whole and will he bear that very much in mind when the lusaka negotiations take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will wish to thank the noble lord lord newall for opening this discussion and more particularly for the speech which he has delivered <e> <s> it is of the greatest importance that members of this house should be visiting other countries with concern to try to find a solution to their problems <e> <s> the noble lords speech indicates that and the proposals he made should be considered by the ministers and the whole house <e>", "<cs> i was quoting from the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will consider very seriously the reports that these cuts may apply to africa and asia <e> <s> is he aware that many of us receive from different countries in africa from india and from malaysia letters paying tribute to the objectivity of the bbcs world service <e> <s> in view of the enormous importance of these areas in the future and of british influence there may i ask him whether he will be very careful not to cut off services to these territories <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question in view of the worldwide character of this problem will the british government take the initiative in having the whole issue discussed by the general assembly of the united nations and afterwards by the security council <e> <s> because some international action is needed if this problem is to be solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in their consideration will the government bear in mind that the government of the united states of america have recognised the new government <e> <s> will they also bear in mind that almost uniquely after the military coup this government are showing extraordinary liberal intentions <e> <s> they are allowing the refugees in the embassy to go to their countries they are not going to have courts-martial for opponents and have indicated that there will be no executions <e> <s> in view of all these facts will her majestys government recognise as early as possible this new government of hope <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this in view of the fact that the united states have contributed million to supplying medical aid and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the house and the public be made more aware of what has been happening at this committee <e> <s> has it not discussed the test ban treaty nuclear disarmament and a ban on chemical radiological and new weapons of destruction <e> <s> surely this house and the public ought to have more information <e> <s> what has occurred since the speech of the foreign secretary at the united nations assembly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask two specific questions arising from these discussions <e> <s> first the negotiations regarding a ban on chemical weapons between the us and the ussr having dragged on for four years is it not possible for the geneva committee itself to prepare a convention <e> <s> secondly with regard to the objection of the west to a ban on new weapons of destruction until a weapon has been identified is that not too late <e> <s> cannot research on new weapons of destruction be put into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the fact that the government recognise the seriousness of these proposals may i ask whether they go some way to meeting the wests demands at vienna and cannot they perhaps with some expansion be made the basis for negotiation on an agreement <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord this question could they not be followed by negotiation to contain the ss missile and the backfire bomber of the soviet union and so avoid confrontation by the staging all over europe of the cruise missiles with their warheads <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reference to wider ownership in the question can the minister say what ownership could be wider than ownership by the whole of our people through our government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible for her majestys government to do something to stop this madness of nuclear missile confrontation in the world which may destroy all life <e> <s> can they not support the recommendations made by the special assembly of the united nations and the geneva committee the proposal of president brezhnev for negotiations on missiles in central europe <e> <s> has the noble lord seen the decision of the ruling party in holland yesterday that this matter should be postponed for two years in order that negotiations may take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i heard all the exchanges but is the minister aware that i decline to go to moscow while the ussr retains its treatment of its dissidents <e> <s> and i am not speaking on behalf of the soviet union but on behalf of world disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this recognising that the present breach of relations due to the invasion of afganistan creates difficulty for negotiations is it not a first necessity that there should be some negotiation about the limitation of nuclear arms in view of the danger of their escalation and their use <e> <s> may i particularly ask the government will they be prepared when the opportunity recurs to support the french governments proposal for a european disarmament conference to break the deadlock between the nato powers and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that as widely reported the government are considering the adoption of the american trident missile system which would involve five nuclear powered submarines <e> <s> can he confirm that the system would cost the astronomical figure of million <e> <s> would not its effect be to escalate the nuclear confrontation <e> <s> is he aware that each submarine would have missiles with warheads and that one warhead would be five times as destructive as the bomb dropped at hiroshima <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government pause before they begin this vast expenditure <e> <s> is the minister aware that the official manifesto of the labour party at the last election included the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this is not an isolated case <e> <s> is there not now enough evidence to require an inquiry into our whole treatment of

able to give us <e> <s> is it not the case that the geneva committee has been unable to discuss the test ban nuclear weapons chemical weapons and verification because those matters are already being discussed by the two super-powers <e> <s> is it not desirable that those matters should be discussed for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that there has been a long delay the test ban has been discussed for years <e> <s> secondly is it not important to have the views of the members of the committee and not only those of the two super-powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is it the case that the soviet union proposed halting the manufacture of all nuclear weapons and proposed their gradual reduction until ultimate destruction and that the wests delegates declined to discuss that <e> <s> will the government in the discussions this year support the proposals of the unaligned governments that that resolution should be considered <e>", "<cs> my

treatment of sakharov in moscow <e> <s> but is the noble lord aware that one of sakharovs alleged crimes is to oppose the extension of nuclear arms <e> <s> if latin america can have a free zone why should we not seek it in europe as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has unusually asked me a question <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that i have not suggested that western europe alone should declare this free zone <e> <s> is he aware that i have suggested that poland and eastern germany should be included <e> <s> is he also aware that there are dissidents in both those territories who are supporting this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this <e> <s> before a review is made of legislation would it not be possible to make a statement in simple language so that the immigrants who are ignorant of their conditions and rights might learn <e> <s> when they make an application in countries abroad this simple statement can be made to them in order to compensate for the absence of knowledge from which they so often suffer when they come to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express to the minister my apology for the timing of my question <e> <s> the forum went on longer than was expected <e> <s> but may i ask him this question while welcoming the declaration to respect human rights as a basis for international scientific co-operation would he not agree that despite the controversy with the soviet delegates valuable and constructive decisions have been made relating to energy food production medical progress and other matters <e> <s> will the government support the unanimous request that there shall be further forums of this character <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister encouraged by the fact that the unaligned nations at the conference sup <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have been critical of the noble lord lord carrington and of lord soames in certain aspects i want very sincerely to congratulate lord carrington on the very remarkable achievement that has occurred <e> <s> no one would have believed a year ago that what i think general walls has described as almost a miracle might have occurred <e> <s> i welcome the fact that mr mugabe has been returned as prime minister and that joshua nkomo has obtained such a large vote <e> <s> i have sent telegrams of congratulation to them today <e> <s> i do that because i believe it may end the terrible war which has been waged in zimbabwe for eleven years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the people of this country know where arms are sent on their behalf <e> <s> as the most crucial issue which affects both them and their children is war and peace i should like to ask whether arms are being sent to some of our allies who have been found guilty by the united nations of denying human rights and even of torture <e> <s> does that not destroy our integrity when we rightly condemn the soviet union for its treatment of dissidents <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister deny that arms are being sold to indonesia singapore pakistan turkey argentina and ethiopia all of which are imprisoning political opponents without trial <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> will he not agree that the present treatment of violent offenders generally is proving a failure and that there is no rehabilitation <e> <s> however is not the liberal treatment at barlinnie proving successful not only in the well-publicised case of mr boyle but in others <e> <s> are discussions taking place about the extension of the barlinnie system and if so would it not be to the benefit of the officers at the maze prison if it were applied there and thus undermine the ira propaganda about the h block which is probably their most effective instrument to influence others <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the minister has said do not the recidivist statistics prove the absolute failure of our present prison system to deal with violent offenders <e> <s> is not the result of the more progressive treatment of barlinnie an indication that rehabilitation can take place <e> <s> if it were applied in northern ireland would it not destroy the ira propaganda which is proving so effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be following the noble lord lord aldington <e> <s> it is a new experience <e> <s> the spokesman from that bench and the spokesman from this bench generally represent the extreme opposites in this houseand therefore

attention to that bench than to this will seriously consider the appeal which he has made that priority should be given by the government to the problems which are raised in the brandt report <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to ask the noble lord before he sat down this question <e> <s> i was perplexed by what he said earlier in his speech that british aid was greater than what we received in return <e> <s> is it not the case that private investment is included in our estimate of aid <e> <s> was it not estimated up to the end of that we received back in repayment for loans dividend and interest three times more than the expanded interpretation of aid which was given <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but is it not the case that very little progress was made <e> <s> in view of the fact that the united nations security council as long ago as august called on south africa to withdraw immediately from namibia is it not now time that strong pressure were exerted upon south africa to meet the proposals of the united nations mission <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question is not the situation in namibia very dangerous as was the situation in zimbabwe before the successful meeting at lancaster house and the elections in rhodesia <e> <s> is not the recalcitrant feeling of south africa and white economic interest in namibia itself due to the fact that there is fear that in an election swapo would win just as mr mugabe has won in zimbabwe and in view of the fact that we have monitoring troops there many more than there were in zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask whether in addition to our own contribution we shall be making a contribution through the european community <e> <s> is it the case that today the representative of the european community is discussing with mr mugabe contributions to zimbabwe <e> <s> is it the case that between million and million will be contributed from the eec over the next five years and shall we be contributing towards that sum <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from that reply is it not the case that the contribution from the eec will depend upon the signing of the lom agreement by zimbabwe and can anything be done immediately before that signature is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> was it revealed in these discussions that the objections of the south african government to the united nations proposal are in relation to the extent of the demilitarised zone the swapo military bases and the size of the united nations force <e> <s> do the government agree with dr waldheim the secretary-general of the united nations that the time has now come for definitive political decisions despite south african differences to allow the supervised election to take place by january at the latest <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the demilitarised zone on the angolan border stretch miles in width and be miles across and would not that prevent any intervention by angola as has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that every member of this house deplores what has happened <e> <s> wishes to express sympathy with the injured and supports compensation for those victims who are not covered <e> <s> i wish strongly to support the proposal for a public inquiry <e> <s> it is not enough that there should be an investigation within the police force <e> <s> we want an inquiry and a report which will have the confidence of the black people as well as of the white <e> <s> i strongly urge that that should happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the amended resolution would have guaranteed

right to self-determination including if they choose an independent state <e> <s> is not security for israel and palestinian self-determination the policy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not the case that the plo has recently modified its policy <e> <s> was not its representative at the united nations largely responsible for the resolution to which i have already referred and which recognises the right of palestine to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which we are discussing this evening relates to the preparations for the independence of zimbabwe and i shall be devoting most of my remarks to this but perhaps the house will forgive me if first i refer to another aspect of the matter because during the proceedings which have resulted in the early independence of zimbabwe i refrained from criticism <e> <s> i did so because i did not want to prejudice the development of the proceedings <e>", "<cs> it is quite true my lords i was not there one need not have been at lancaster house and one need not have been in rhodesia <e> <s> one had very full reports and very detailed information from those concerned very detailed <e>", "<cs> not so <e> <s> the government cannot avoid the fact that not only did they desire a victory for the bishop muzerewa and ian smith coalition but that their actions were exerted against a victory for the patriotic front <e> <s> for example the lancaster house agreement was that the troops on both sides should go to assembly points or be in barracks <e> <s> instead of that even the private army of the bishop was used extensively in security operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i always appreciate interruptions from the noble lord because they help me so much <e> <s> britain has the main

that the present condition in rhodesia is the result mainly of the failure of yes the previous labour government and this government to deal with the rebellion by the whites <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the secretary of state whether he is aware that we all recognise the momentous event which the independence of zimbabwe will be and that despite any criticisms which have been made we want to congratulate him on the part that he has taken <e> <s> britain the united states of america and the european community have already indicated that they will give considerable financial

in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not planned economic arrangements between the two coordinated authorities would be more effective than the eec proposal that separate negotiations should take place with the nations in the communist sphere <e> <s> will not this inevitably lead to come-con negotiating separately with west european countries thus increasing their division <e> <s> is not this decision a repudiation of the helsinki agreement whose main provision was for joint economic co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the present arrangements for discussions on environmental pollution will be maintained and whether it will be possible to review the extension of joint activities which are so important for both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the request from my front bench for an increase of the british contribution may i ask the noble lord this is not a tremendous debt due to the commonwealth because at the commonwealth meeting at lusaka there were initiated the proceedings which have led to the recognition of the independence of zimbabwe <e> <s> have not the government made an appeal to all countries to contribute towards the reconstruction of zimbabwe <e> <s> has not that appeal gone out quite recently so that it is not possible now to say what the commonwealth countries have contributed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in two respects is not this importation of uranium from the rtz company at rossing illegal <e> <s> first is it not the case that there is a partnership with the south african government which has been declared illegal and an action against international law <e> <s> secondly did not the united nations general assembly on th december adopt a decree for the protection of the natural resources of namibia which declared that no natural resources may be removed from the territory without the consent and permission of the council of namibia set up in to replace south africa administratively <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not retort by saying that the minister is wrong in every respect <e> <s> however is it not the case that the hague tribunal declared the south african administration illegal and that partnership with it even paying taxes to it should therefore be considered illegal <e> <s> secondly despite what the noble lord has said has not the assembly of the united nations but also the security council endorsed the decree to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all of us would want to recognise the quite extraordinary constructive activity of the noble lord here yesterday morning in brussels in the afternoon and late at night and here this morning preparing this complicated statement <e> <s> all of us would want to pay tribute to that <e> <s> but may i add that some of us are disturbed by these developments beginning with diplomatic and economic limited arrangements and proceeding to full economic sanctions followed by military action by the american government <e> <s> those of us who were active politically before the first world war see now a terrible parallel of sliding into a war situation <e> <s> are not these actions likely to unite and make more militant the people of iran <e> <s> will there not be dangers for the lives of the hostages rather than making for their release and may these actions not lead to a situation of war <e> <s> would not continued patient diplomatic action difficult as it would be be more likely to save the hostages than the course on which we have started <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is not this a little precipitate and a little insensitive to international discussions which are taking place in two spheres <e> <s> is it not the case that at this moment discussions are taking place between the powers to make chemical weapons outlawed just as biological weapons have already been outlawed

i recognise the great difficulties about verification because chemical weapons can be produced under cover so easily is that not also true of biological weapons which we have agreed to outlaw <e> <s> when charges are made against the soviet union are they not obviously sometimes exaggerated <e> <s> has the noble lord seen the report by the correspondent in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the deep concern of many of us who pioneered the legislation against racial discrimination in this country at the scepticism which the ethnic <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that any scepticism on the part of the non-white communities in this country is due not to the membership of the commission but to its limitations <e> <s> announcements are to be made today and i have seen only the short list of those who are to be nominated to the commission <e> <s> would the noble lord confirm that they are all conservative members of councils or blacks who have important positions utterly unrelated to the ethnic community as a whole <e> <s> will he bear in mind that mr lane the chairman of the commission after paying warm tribute to those who have been removed said as reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

this week by the french government that there should be a summit meeting of heads of state in january followed by a sustained conference next year on the very big agenda if a package agreement is to be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question is not an agreement just as necessary for the western nations as it is for the third world <e> <s> would not the lifting of standards of millions of people in the world mean a demand for goods and less unemployment in our countries in the west <e> <s> could the noble lord confirm two points <e> <s> he informed me last week

proposals have now been supplemented by the united nations world food council which has increased its food reserves to the third world <e> <s> would he confirm these two points <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister spoke of the difficulty of financial aid from this country <e> <s> is he aware that the proposed agenda for this conference is much more than aid <e> <s> is he aware that the agenda covers raw materials energy trade development and finance and that it is a matter of mutual trade rather than aid from the western countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not answer the question whether the report will be placed in the printed paper office in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords delighted as i am by that reply may i ask this of the noble lord when we become members of this house do we not take an oath or an affirmation of support for the church <e> <s> while some of us have reservations about that may i ask whether this is not a case where the whole house should give support to the archbishop and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply and for arranging for the document to be placed in the library may i ask

"<cs> my lords can the minister say what was the attitude of the british delegation on the motion vetoed by the soviet union which demanded economic and military action <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt at all that the peoples of the next century will regard the peoples and governments of this century as mad <e> <s> they will regard us as mad because during the second half of this century we

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that there is a great deal of uncertainty as to the intentions of the soviet union in dismantling half their protection around moscow <e> <s> it might be either that they are thinking of the ultimate endorsement of salt or they may be changing it in a way which will make our new missiles unable to penetrate <e> <s> could this not be resolved

i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the joint action by the united states and soviet union and their initiative in this matter may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that some of us are rather puzzled by the distinction between this convention and the convention adopted in endorsed by nations and ratified by

for his explanation and quiet honestly i wanted the information may i ask him whether the convention did not deal with biological weapons and are they not complementary to the radiological weapons which come under this convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel very humble following the speech which we have just heard from the noble earl lord cranbrook because it was so full of the detailed knowledge of a scientist and biologist which few members of this house can claim <e> <s> i can only say as a layman in that field that i was fascinated by what he told us <e> <s> i shall before i

the minister whether it would not immensely extend the prestige of the european community if it did something to deal with the poverty problem in europe which an investigation has shown has similar causes in practically all the european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords when the monitoring of the effects of these higher fees takes place may i ask the minister whether there will be consideration not

the noble lord say whether the report is correct that at the meeting referred to the foreign and commonwealth secretary the noble lord lord carrington stated that british aid public and private is

my lords with some apology i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords surely her majestys government have some responsibility for what goes on in hong kong <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the evictions are likely to take place next thursday <e> <s> do they not relate to factories run by small businessmen which have been rented for

reasonable proposals including an offer that if the government will provide sites for the factories and adequate compensation they will agree to co-operate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that all of us appreciate what the hong kong government have done in relation to housing but arising from his previous answer is it not the case that the compensation offered is

majestys government to take the initiative to secure the neutralisation of the indian ocean so that the island would no longer be necessary for defensive purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the question of the neutralisation of the indian ocean is separate but is it not the case that the reason for its retention separately from mauritius is its use as an american base <e> <s> the minister says that the british would consider the neutralisation <e> <s> if this government really believe in world disarmament as they say they do can they not take the initiative in this great step <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all those who have listened to this debate will have been impressed by the fact of how seriously from all sides of the house there has been a search for some way

stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming that answer may i ask the minister this question did not this parade show that a large number of companies are defying this embargo on arms <e> <s> in particular could he confirm that the south african government have acquired per cent <e> <s> of the shares in the united states space research corporation which has provided

<e> <s> however is it not also the case that south african troops are in other african countries and french troops are in other african countries <e> <s> should not that be balanced by a demand for the withdrawal of all foreign troops <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming that reply may i ask the minister whether he appreciates how much we welcome the reversal in policy which was in the paper on the brandt commission how much we would wish to congratulate the secretary of state the noble lord

subsisted for seven years between north and south by accepting the need for a new world economic order <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the ministers earlier reply to me in which he said that there

a deputation from the archbishops and bishops be arranged to meet the hunger strikers in their prison to try to dissuade them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that these figures were issued by the united states defense department <e> <s> are they not terribly grave and should not the public be

viscount not agree that if there was an epidemic in the world which threatened all life then world action west and east north and south would be taken and is this not a man-made epidemic just as disastrous potentially for mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for his full reply and though not agreeing with it entirely may i ask him whether if the government recognise the danger of a nuclear war they would take the initiative at the disarmament convention now meeting at geneva on the instructions of the united nations to propose a treaty which would dismantle nuclear weapons all over the world in the east as well as the west with adequate verification <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>",

supporting malta in its proposal for security in the mediterranean <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the series of immigration acts has been related to immediate circumstances mostly the coming of non-whites to this country and that it does not represent an overall policy <e> <s> are there

ask this question specifically is it not the case that in northern ireland on th december the following changes were announced and will they be applied to prisons in the rest of britain civilian clothing during working hours eight letters four parcels and four visits each month association in the evenings and at weekends and work suited to the prisoner with vocational and educational treatment <e> <s> will those changes be extended to britain <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the character of the government of guatemala and the uncertainty in that territory will the government be

paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming that answer i should like to ask the minister the following question is not the alternative to an international convention now very dangerous <e> <s> has that not been illustrated in recent speeches by our own secretary of state for defence by the talks between officials british and american in new york by the adoption by the senate of a vote of million dollars to build a plant for nerve gases and by its request to president reagan to make a report on the production of nerve gas early this year <e>", "<cs> my lords although the verification of chemical weapons is difficult because they can be used for industrial purposes is it not the case that the soviet union has accepted the principle of verification and cannot this be followed by finding methods by which that verification can be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government whether they will very seriously consider not placing these missiles in northern ireland for three reasons first they would intensify the sectarian confrontation in northern ireland secondly the radioactive fall-out would almost inevitably penetrate the republic of ireland and thirdly as sean mcbride that great international figure has pointed out all ireland might become a target in the case of a nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not strange that parliament should not have been informed of this expansion of defence equipment and that we should learn about it only by the notification to the berks <e> <s> county council and two

circularised all local authorities in britain to adopt similar resolutions <e> <s> will not the government be faced with great opposition probably from the majority of local authorities to placing

leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome that reply may i ask the minister whether he can clarify the nature of the european

that reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply may i ask him this question since the new hebrides were a condominium under british and french control were we not mutually parties to the agreement which brought it independence <e> <s> can he confirm that in paris last week the french denied signing the agreement and is it not the case that the loss of million has disrupted education closing schools until next week <e> <s> in view of that situation will the british government with australia give some aid <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the delicate situation i will not put the supplementary question i had planned but may i ask the noble earl this is there anything in the agreement which gives the french the right to revoke it on the ground of the support which has been given to the independence movement in new caledonia <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that this fall in the number of students is regrettable and likely to be larger in the figures because of the higher charges <e> <s> is it not regrettable from two points of view <e> <s> does it not limit knowledge and appreciation of this country abroad and does it not mean that the students who do come are from the rich lite or are subsidised by governments which is very much the same thing and do not include many promising students from all classes in these territories <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that there is very great danger in this proposal <e> <s> will it not mean that when they are not under the authorities in the public service the motivation of these services would under free enterprise become profit <e>", "<cs> my lords

investigation if it were by an authority independent of the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the training of the school-leavers and recognising the right to opt for military training may i ask whether the government will give us an assurance that when discussions with them take place civilian training will be given equal persuasion to military training <e> <s> will the government be very careful in their procedure not to give any indication of economic conscription <e>", "<cs> my lords although i appreciate the reply the minister did not answer my question as to whether when these discussions take place there is persuasion for civilian training equally with military training <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister remember that his late right honourable friend reginald maudling described the nuclear bomb as the final abuse of god <e> <s> is it not a fact that the neutron bomb

third world countries because of this american proposal and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there are not three differences first is not the cost greater as my noble friend lord

increasing exhibitions of towards ethnic minorities by other residents in this country <e> <s> in view of that situation will the minister suggest to the secretary of state that very great care should be taken about the nature of this investigation so that it may have the confidence of the ethnic minorities and not lead to further criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very sincerely congratulate the

question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but is it not the case that there has been no progress since the abortive geneva conference owing to the intransigence of south africa in relying on a new attitude by president reagan <e> <s> is it not the case that south africa is now using its military strength to increase its occupation even going deep into angola <e>

president reagan should end the illegal south african occupation of namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that when there is fear of swapos ideology we should bear in mind the case of zimbabwe where there was similar fear of mugabes ideology <e> <s> is it not the case that failure of the west to act will increase the influence of the soviet union and help to determine the character of the independent namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that this is due to the fact that president reagan had declined to attend a meeting before the autumn and was supported in that by our prime minister <e> <s> may i also ask does not delay seriously prejudice the chances of success of the summit meeting <e> <s> because it was timed to take place in june before the meeting of the western heads of state in canada in july where its findings would have been the first item

world disarmament <e> <s> and is not the latter now quite a practical proposal made by the united nations special assembly being discussed by the geneva committee which is to make a report to the renewed united nations assembly in june next year <e> <s> is it not now a realistic proposal which the government should support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the public are almost unaware of what is happening at the meetings of the geneva committee <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case whenever world disarmament is suggested that the government insist on verification <e> <s> is it not the case that the soviet union has now accepted verification in principle <e> <s> furthermore is not the need for greater information made necessary by the fact that agreement has been largely reached at geneva on a proposal that if a complaint is made then on-the-spot united nations inspection shall take place and if a government refuse it they will be assumed to have breached the convention <e> <s> is this not a way out of this great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister three questions <e> <s> first while welcoming the appointment of the noble and learned lord lord scarman as chairman will the government be very careful to appoint a membership of this inquiry which receives the confidence of those involved <e> <s> will they include a member of the racial community councils and of the ethnic organisations <e> <s> secondly can the minister say whether the apparently rather restricted terms of reference will include a discussion of the deeper reasons for the sense of frustration particularly the unemployment among young workers mainly blacks but also including whites <e> <s> thirdly will the inquiry pay special attention to what has been done in handsworth birmingham a very similar locality <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened with great respect to the noble viscount lord montgomery because of his residence in el salvador <e> <s> it may seem almost an impertinence that someone who has not been there should differ from him in some of his conclusions <e> <s> i can only say that people are often resident in a country but are in a different environment and have a different political attitude two people may live in a country together yet come to different conclusions <e> <s> the views which i shall express are also a reflection of the views of those who have lived in el salvador and know the circumstances there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since the visit of the defence minister there has been the visit of the prime minister <e> <s> is it not the case that it is very dangerous to be supplying arms in this explosive area <e> <s> is it not the case that it is not merely the issue between the soviet union and the west but between israel and the palestinian issue and even between arab countries and by providing arms to different interests on different sides are we not encouraging this area to become a crucible for a world war <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he would clarify the relationship of this country in its proposed contribution to the rapid deployment force which america has suggested <e> <s> is it the case that the prime minister has made it quite clear that the force would be used only with the consent of the gulf states <e> <s> is it true that the united emirate states have rejected any facilities for such a force <e> <s> could the minister also say whether her majestys government have made any response to the proposal which was first made by jordan and is now made by kuwait and the soviet union for a world conference on the middle east to end the dangerous arms race there <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the decision to urge an early negotiation may i ask whether the government will seek at the meeting of the nato foreign ministers in rome early next month to reach a decision about the date of the negotiations <e> <s> is there not hope that this negotiation might lead to the withdrawal of the soviet sss and the backfire bomber and make unnecessary the stationing of the cruise missile in this country <e> <s> has the minister noted the decision of the belgian and netherlands governments not to station cruise missiles until the result of these negotiations <e> <s> could not our government reach a similar decision particularly in view of the critical report on the effectiveness of the cruise by the united states congress study which was published yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that seven years after the turkish invasion these talks have made little progress <e> <s> although one welcomes the recent decision for a joint committee on missing persons <e> <s> but may i ask is not the fundamental issue federation within one state or confederation within two states and are not the british government committed as a guarantor of the integrity and sovereignty of cyprus a view to which the united nations is also committed by its resolutions of and to taking and should we not therefore be taking further action to secure a solution to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the sincere desire of the government to find a solution to this problem may i ask the minister whether they would consider action in three directions in order to bring world pressure for a solution first a review of this problem in the security council of the united nations second consideration of it in the european community since turkey and greece are now to be associated with nato and third within the commonwealth secretariat of which cyprus is a member <e> <s> would not pressure in those three directions support the pressure on the unaligned nations to bring about an end to this confrontation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this study is very sceptical about the operational efficiency of the cruise missile <e> <s> has not the situation been completely changed by the statement of the united states representative at the nato foreign ministers conference that they will establish talks with the soviet union to end these weapons in europe before the end of the year <e> <s> is that not an additional reason to the pressure which is being exerted in west germany holland belgium and this country against <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the clinics which are being established in india and other countries by the family planning organisation and the marie stopes centenary appeal <e> <s> can he tell us what aid the government are giving to those organisations which are doing the practical work <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this an appalling situation <e> <s> when we are cutting down expenditure to end poverty in the third world at the same time we are increasing expenditure on selling them arms when their own money is so necessary to deal with the poverty in their countries <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming what the minister is doing may i ask him this have both the opposition and the government in belize agreed to accept the result of the referendum <e>", "<cs> may i declare an interest <e> <s> is the minister aware that as the questioner has stated many old people now who are hard of hearing are being denied many of the amenities which others enjoy <e>", "<cs> my lords as the oldest member of the national union of journalists may i ask the minister whether he is aware that working journalists are absolutely opposed to this policy as was shown in the recent annual meeting of our union <e> <s> is not the real difficulty that per cent <e> <s> of the circulation of newspapers is owned by three families and two individuals who are seeking their own profit rather than the welfare of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in addition to the who have been killed in el salvador there is now a danger that the governments in central america with the usa will be lining up on the two sides <e> <s> are there not already military clashes between honduras and nicaragua potentially dangerous for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that this is a matter for the parties in el salvador <e> <s> is he aware that the whole of the opposition there the catholic church many christian democrats the democratic socialists as well as the resistance movements are all in favour of this mediation <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that the president of mexico has just said that one small error by the united states military advisers in el salvador could produce war on an international level and that mexico would defend the nicaraguan cause as though it were their own <e> <s> is that not evidence of the explosive situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord banks in expressing appreciation to the noble baroness lady elles for having initiated this debate <e> <s> i particularly welcome her reference to east/west trade although i shall take a different view from hers <e> <s> i regard the chapter in the helsinki agreement dealing with economic co-operation as being the most important as a contribution to bringing about better relations between east and west <e> <s> it discussed proposals for common action at the frontiers joint power stations transport by air land and water <e> <s> integrate economies in that way and the danger of war becomes much less <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is it not the case that negotiations have been held up by the new american proposal <e> <s> does not that proposal depart from the settlement suggested by the five western powers and united nations resolution <e> <s> in seeking a constructive solution has the minister noted the statement yesterday in salisbury by mr nujuma the president of swapo that he would accept a lancaster house type of conference if south africas illegal administration was ended and united nations authority accepted up to the election <e> <s> would not united nations withdrawal of its support from swapo before the election be a contribution to a solution of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords does the united states proposal for a bill of rights which is now being considered by the five western governments include economic restrictions <e> <s> although one welcomes civil rights for the white minority must we not be very careful not to contravene the african demand that natural resources should be nationally owned <e> <s> is this not particularly necessary because per cent <e> <s> of the enriched uranium in this country comes from namibia <e> <s> the french socialist party now dominant in france where our uranium is processed has stated that it will break trade links with namibia unless a satisfactory solution is reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the minister on his new appointment and wish him success in it <e> <s> may i ask him is it not the case that this prominent white citizen years old was released not because of the inhumanity of the charge against him but because his wife paid the remainder of the fine so that they might celebrate their th wedding anniversary together <e> <s> is it not the case that mr webster had declined to pay the fine in protest against the discriminatory group areas act which forbade him to provide accommodation for coloured persons <e> <s> was he not deported miles into namibia despite the fact that the act is not in operation there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government will express to the south african government the strongest condemnation of this discriminative act in walvis bay and of the imprisonment of this man in namibia where the act does not even apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to do much more than thank the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow for initiating this debate <e> <s> i want to congratulate him and his colleagues on the select committee on european communities for their work <e> <s> we know very little of what is happening in the european community but the select committee here is giving far more consideration to it and evidence about it than any similar body in another place <e> <s> the report which the committee has produced is typical of their work the thoroughness the evidence of experts and their own report and i suggest to this house that we must find some new method of considering their recommendations and their evidence otherwise it may disappear into thin air <e> <s> i doubt whether very many of us would even have studied this report if it had not been the fact that we were having this debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord greenhill knows me he would expect me to deal with that problem before i conclude my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i am shocked by the committees indication that they regard this per cent <e> <s> of expenditure as reasonable <e> <s> the committee urges instead that the major responsibility should be with bilateral aid and through the multinational agencies <e> <s> the noble lord lord carrington has today endorsed that view of preference for bilateral aid <e> <s> but how utterly inadequate bilateral aid is <e> <s> the report gives tables which show that only saudi arabia and kuwait from their vast oil profits have reached the accepted target of per cent <e> <s> of gross national product in each country <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i am getting a little older and i did not hear his intervention <e> <s> however i hope that what i shall continue to say will meet the point that he has made <e> <s> i was saying that except for those two oil-rich countries every country has failed even to reach the per cent <e> <s> target of the gross national product the soviet union per cent <e> <s> the united states per cent <e> <s> and the united kingdom has done a little better per cent <e> <s> but in addition to inadequacy bilateral aid has great disadvantages <e> <s> it is frequently tied to political motivation and economic compensation rather than meeting the needs of the poor of the world <e> <s> it is directed both to military and ideological alliances and secondly to commitment to contracts with the purchases from donor countries <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government noted the condemnation of the soviet action by the non-aligned nations of the world <e> <s> will the government give the utmost support to the efforts which the non-aligned nations are now making to bring about a solution to this problem by a conference between afghanistan and the neighbouring states <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister may i ask does not each of the issues listed in my question reflect the danger of war <e> <s> would it not be far better in view of the width and complexity of this frightening situation that they should be comprehensively and successively discussed at an international conference over which the usa and the ussr might preside rather than by dealing with each separate question as it becomes urgent leaving the closely related questions unsettled and still continuously explosive <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the discussion at tomorrows meeting of the security council would the government support the idea of a nuclear free zone in this area which would meet the suspicions about developing nuclear weapons both in iraq and in israel <e> <s> would the government also seek to end the supply of arms to both sides israel and the arab countries which is increasing the danger of military rivalry and the likelihood of the destruction of this explosive area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the defence debate the noble lord lord trefgarne stated that the government would give careful consideration to our proposals <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the united nations special assembly on disarmament last year recommended the ending of all nuclear weapons and phased progress to general disarmament <e> <s> do not our proposals achieve that in a practical way <e> <s> is he aware that we now have the support of a majority on the geneva committee <e> <s> will the united kingdom change their attitude and give us support there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the massive feeling now on this subject <e> <s> is he aware that we are thinking in our meetings not in terms of hundreds but of thousands <e> <s> in edinburgh in plymouth and a crowded guildhall at southampton <e> <s> is he aware that this is worldwide and with unemployment this problem of nuclear weapons is now becoming a dominant issue in peoples minds <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the government will give encouragement both to access and to facilities for the disabled in toilets <e> <s> may i also ask whether the attention of the government has been drawn to the practice in sweden which i visited last week where indications are given on doors that such facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords is this matter not related to considerations by the law of the sea conference and would it not be better that this difficult problem should be delayed until recommendations have been made by that conference <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the welcome fact that the noble lord lord carrington is now to preside over the foreign ministers in the eec may i ask the minister whether we can expect him to remove this anomaly where european citizens in this country are allowed to vote and british citizens in other european countries are not allowed to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the very moving precedent given by this school may i ask whether it is not possible in suitable places it may be a few in the first instance to establish public schools which are non-denominational and which teach ethical principles rather than those of any particular church <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be voting for the amendment in the name of my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones at the end of the day but i do not regard this bill as untimely only now i regard it as untimely at all times <e> <s> i want first to acknowledge that i approach this bill differently from the approach of many members of this house <e> <s> i feel a sense of world citizenship more than i feel a sense of national citizenship <e> <s> i love this country <e> <s> i feel identified with our history and its great figures the movements ever since the th century which have been struggling for justice and for freedom and our countryside <e> <s> every spring as one gets older is more beautiful than the last <e> <s> and our people the beauty of so many families parents towards their children <e> <s> i revere the people of our country who are dedicated in service to others and to peace and to ending hunger in the world <e> <s> i love this country for its toleration its freedom of thought and of speech <e> <s> but as i go about the world i find that those characteristics are also true of many other races <e> <s> my feeling is that i belong to the human race even more than i belong to the british race <e> <s> my first reason for opposing this bill is that it rejects world citizenship and rejects belonging to the human race <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us will want to welcome the attitude of the government on this issue and particularly the delegation which made a rebuke to the consortium of vested interests which lobbied against the code <e> <s> is it not the case that in third world conditions because of impure water the absence of facilities for sterilisation and the illiteracy of many of the mothers who cannot read the instructions a million baby lives hundreds already dead have been endangered by past practices <e>", "<cs> my lords in this unusually congenial atmosphere may i ask the minister if he would <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the contributions to peace made under the influence of the noble lord may i ask whether he is aware that successive public polls have shown a large majority against the installation of the trident <e> <s> instead of transferring its cost to other armed forces particularly nuclear weapons may i ask if it would not be better for the government actively to support in the geneva committee the recommendations of the united nations special assembly for progressing world disarmament and transferring military costs to ending poverty in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while regretting that decision i should like to ask the minister whether the united nations report to the conference stated that unscrupulous shipowners use flags of convenience to operate dangerous vessels and engage in maritime fraud <e> <s> is it not the case that in the number of ships of this kind that were lost at sea was three times greater than that of other ships <e> <s> is it not the case that these ships outrageously exploit third world labour and evade taxation <e> <s> will the government do something to stop this unacceptable and inhuman practice <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the vast extent of these dangerous practices <e> <s> is not nearly one-third of the total shipping now under flags of convenience from liberia and panama <e> <s> and while identities are often concealed is it not estimated that three-quarters of them are from the united states japan and hong kong <e> <s> while there is little evidence of british companies being concerned directly they are in fact involved through trans-national companies and will the government look particularly at hong kong which is a crown colony <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is true that old-age pensioners and some of the unemployed benefit are not a very large number of the unemployed still left without the right to free prescriptions <e> <s> does this not apply to part-time workers and does this not apply to the thousands who are now receiving less than a living wage as was indicated in a recent report of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this question is not scientific opinion increasingly coming to the conclusion that there is no civil defence against nuclear war <e> <s> has the noble lord noted the background paper published this week by the british medical association to their inquiry saying that even deep shelters will not protect people from nuclear war <e> <s> would it not be much better to concentrate on getting world agreement to end nuclear arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister may i ask whether in present circumstances there is not a need to increase the stability of the polish government <e> <s> has the minister noted the statement by the deputy prime minister yesterday that poland is faced with economic catastrophe and may this not undermine the stability of its government <e> <s> may i ask one thing more <e> <s> while one appreciates the need for delicacy in western aid would it not be possible to prevent reaction by allocating any aid specifically to the purpose of paying interest charges on debts to the west <e> <s> might that not lead to co-operation rather than confrontation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating that answer may i ask the minister this does not the unesco constitution involve the assurance of the free flow of information and ideals across frontiers <e> <s> is it not the case that in addition to unesco only seven countries have decided to make contributions for this purpose <e> <s> does not the fact that the only two western countries are the netherlands and france mean that the third world may feel a further rebuff to the unfortunate dialogue that has taken place over the last seven years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government have now changed their policy from asking us all to stay at home to a policy of deep shelters <e> <s> if so has his attention been drawn to the background paper of the inquiry of the british medical association which says that shelters would be useless owing to the blast heat in most of the united kingdom and that and i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this rather a sad story <e> <s> is it not the case that this archipelago in the indian ocean was dismembered from mauritius before mauritius even had indepencence with the result that people members of families of fishermen and peasants were evacuated <e> <s> is it not the case that when they reached mauritius there were no arrange <e>", "<cs>

only with the mauritian government but with the whole of the opposition the whole of mauritius and the representatives of the exiled people <e> <s> will the government seek to renew those discussions

my mind <e> <s> i differed from him in his conclusions but i am sure that other noble lords were like me deeply impressed by the courage of his utterance <e> <s> the way in which the noble lord dealt with difficult problems with an utter sense of truthfulness in his expression is an example to us all and i want to express my appreciation of that <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the whole situation due to the fact that the government have refused independent arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister noted the statement in the brandt report that a mere fraction of per cent <e> <s> of military expenditure could end poverty in the world within a decade <e> <s> will the government both nationally and internationally seek to bring about that result <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible for the government to make known these facilities to people on lower incomes in view of the fact that large numbers of them are completely unaware of these facilities at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the suggestion that everyone should share would this proposal extend to the salaries of the management and the fees of the directors in these concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the changed attitude of the government towards the brandt report as indicated by the earlier appalling paper they issued on the subject may i ask the minister this will our representative at the ottawa conference seek to secure a new approach to this problem which has meant north-south dialogue for eight years with an increasing gulf between them <e> <s> will the government make an effort at the ottawa conference to get the heads of the western nations really to approach this issue in a different way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware he certainly could not remember the occasion

sustenance <e> <s> is it not the case that while their conditions have greatly improved their status is still inferior to that of many other employees including shorthand-typists <e> <s> will the

attitude is he aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that in his speech the noble lord lord soames declared in favour of international disarmament <e> <s> this surely must be the forward road not only for the reasons so powerfully argued by lord zuckerman on economic grounds but on human grounds indeed for the life of mankind <e> <s> i was a little disappointed that lord soames did not follow up that declaration by proposals on how international disarmament could be achieved <e> <s> i ask the house to bear with me tonight if i try to suggest how international disarmament could

sixth formers in schools about overseas problems <e> <s> did she note mr heseltines visit to a comprehensive school in toxteth yesterday when he was so deeply impressed by the width of knowledge of the students <e> <s> will she do her utmost to get our inspectors to encourage this interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that many of these refugees have been returned against their will to the southern area of cyprus and that families have been broken up as a consequence <e> <s> in view of the fact that this government are a guarantor of the integrity of the whole of cyprus can permanent residence not be allowed to these refugees until they have the right to go back to their own

students in london is now being sent back to cyprus <e> <s> will the minister particularly look at that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that president kyprianou is making the utmost effort to reach agreement that he has just recently said that he is always inspired by goodwill and he will exhaust all margins in the dialogue <e> <s> is the noble lord nevertheless aware that the position has been made more difficult by the recent statement by mr denktash

that its occupation of namibia is absolutely illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord skelmersdale sits down will he say whether the government have considered as the noble lord lord carrington promised on the last occasion the proposal that in order that there shall be impartiality during the election the united nations should before the election withdraw their support from swapo

minister whether it is not the case that the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords while refraining from entering into questions about verification about which i have a question later may i ask the

fact that the gambia will still be a part of the british commonwealth may i ask the noble lord this question is he aware that the new confederation as indicated by its negotiations with the imf is now in a very serious economic position and would her majestys government approach the french government which has such close associations with senegal to see whether jointly they cannot do something to rescue the people of the confederation from this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome that activity by the foreign secretary may i ask the minister whether the foreign secretary protested not only against what was happening in papua and east timor but against the persecution involving human rights in indonesia itself <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that for nine years now there has been deadlock in the negotiations between the industrialised countries and the developing countries and there has been no agreement except the delayed agreement about the common <e>", "<cs> but my lords is it not the case that during this period literally hundreds of thousands of people have died from hunger in the third world countries and that something much more fundamental than aid is necessary to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government say what their attitude is on this problem and would it not be very inconsistent if they did not support an inquiry in view of their rightly aggressive attitude to what is happening in poland <e> <s> may i ask him this particularly is the inquiry to be made by the human rights commission <e> <s> if so could the government use their influence to speed up their processes because when they inquired into the military

the minister has given is it not the case that light industries are closing down in acton ealing and southall <e> <s> are the governments measures to help small businesses having any effect upon that

action which the government have taken may i ask whether the government cannot take the initiative suggested by our front bench of bringing this matter before the united nations human rights commission <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the situation largely due to the loyal support which zambia gave to this country when we were regarding the government in southern rhodesia as being an illegal government <e> <s> did zambia not suffer from supporting us in our attitude then <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords

installed on american bases in britain without our consent <e> <s> may i ask him to do two more fundamental things <e> <s> first in view of the charges that chemical weapons have been used in afghanistan kampuchea and eritrea will the government urge the united nations security council to appoint a commission of unaligned nations to examine those charges <e> <s> secondly will the government agree to support at the geneva committee an international convention banning and dismantling all chemical weapons in view of the soviet and american stocks and president reagans plan which the minister himself has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us any timetable for the settlement of this problem which has now been discussed for nearly half a century <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the escalation of the production of chemical weapons on both sides as a result of this situation will her majestys government press on the security council of the united nations not

united nations commission <e> <s> in view of the very dangerous escalation of chemical weapons particularly in america and in view also of the contrary evidence from eritrea by the government and by

he delivered <e> <s> i wish to associate myself with what he said in tribute to the late lord butler <e> <s> like him i had some association with lord butler on colonial issues <e> <s> i was deeply impressed by his tolerance open-mindedness and willingness to hear views which were not his own and particularly i pay tribute to the great act which ended the federation of central africa and brought independence to its countries <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but he is the leader of the largest ethnic party and if that party withdraws as it has the whole strength of that movement will disappear <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of their effect on the balance of warsaw pact power and nato forces can the government state what their response is to the proposals made by president brezhnev three days ago for some unilateral reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by telling a story at least it will make my speech shorter <e> <s> in i was called from the chamber of the house of commons to

when we first meet people we dont tell them our business <e> <s> we make friends and they passed round the pipe of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the ministers answers would he not agree that the deprivation of nurses in the national health service is due to the fact that because of their lower scale of wages they are attracted to three other spheres not only overseas and the private hospitals but to the nursing agencies <e> <s> the national health service has to pay higher wages to nurses from the nursing agencies than it does to its own staff at the cost of its revenue <e>",

visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that there has been a serious deterioration in the

priority of seeking with the united nations with president reagan with the commonwealth secretariat and with all other elements a solution to this problem to prevent a war situation arising at the end

report say that there should be a reduction of in the prison population <e> <s> if a proposal that t made for a wider amnesty is rejected could there not be an amnesty for selective prisoners reaching the many of whom ought not to be in prison at all as appropriate treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how warmly many of us have welcomed the statement at the end of the declaration that all efforts will be made to seek a peaceable settlement of this problem <e> <s> on a number of occasions the minister has referred to resolution <e> <s> is it not the case that even before that resolution made the demand for the withdrawal of argentine troops it asked for a cessation of hostilities <e> <s> can the minister say what has been done to carry out that first demand of resolution <e> <s> has any effort been made to secure a truce during the negotiations with argentina ending its supply of soldiers and equipment to the falkland islands and ourselves halting our fleet while the negotiations take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us will find the earlier part of his answer disappointing <e> <s> is he aware that when the peace mission initiated by the quakers went to the soviet union in january we urged unilateral action by the soviet government and had discussions with the authorities about it <e> <s> is it not the case that president brezhnev has now proposed three unilateral actions first a freeze of present soviet nuclear weapons in europe secondly a suspension of the planned replacement of the old ss missiles and thirdly a reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the second part of the ministers original answer may i ask him whether any date has now been fixed for the strategic talks between the usa and the soviet union and whether he has any information about a response from america to mr brezhnevs proposal that he should meet president reagan in the autumn after the renewed united nations assembly on disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister first in reference to resolution whether or not the first demand is the cessation of hostilities <e> <s> in that situation would it not be good to secure such a cessation so that a truce can be made while negotiations are taking place <e> <s> secondly would the government support the idea of a united nations presence in the falklands with a peace-keeping force to replace the argentine occupation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the leader of the house whether the government will be submitting a motion to parliament supporting what they are doing or whether they will allow a debate upon these issues <e> <s> does she not agree that the

world war and was imprisoned for three years <e> <s> i therefore speak today with some sensitivity <e> <s> there is no need for me to describe the degradation and brutalisation that is in our prisons

much value <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister three questions <e> <s> first in view of the very welcome emphasis on the statement that we are active in diplomatic negotiations would he correct the statement on bbc yesterday and in the press this morning that the foreign secretary urged that united nations activity should be postponed in order that we might take military action <e>

did that plan include one united nations presence in the falkland islands possibly leading to united nations peace-keeping forces two united nations supervision of a referendum of the view of the islanders and three leading to as resolution required direct negotiations between this country and argentina <e> <s> thirdly may i ask this is it not the case that our european partners west germany italy ireland spain have all expressed disappointment that this country has not carried out the order of resolution that there should be a cessation of hostilities and is it not likely now that they will modify their sanctions against argentina in consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that this is a disastrous outcome <e> <s> is it not the case that in march all governments agreed to finalise the convention including the united kingdom and the united states of america when it

final convention did the united kingdom not take the attitude it took in march <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the governments of the united states united kingdom and west germany all

ministers speech detailed reference was made to the negotiations with secretary haig and with the head of state of peru <e> <s> is the minister aware that all of us welcome those negotiations <e> <s> but was not the reference to the united nations much less definite <e> <s> is not the united nations the international authority to which we should look for a solution of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that while we have had our minds on the falkland islands serious dangers to peace have arisen in the middle east <e> <s> while welcoming any action by the european community to secure the double object of security for the israel frontiers and self-determination for the palestinian people would the government now consider whether it is not desirable to recall an international conference on this subject where world pressure both west and east could be exerted to reach a solution on these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that the government have confidence in turkeys government restoring democracy <e> <s> may i ask the minister are not the government blind to all recent history in which claims of that kind have been made and repeatedly denied

advances <e> <s> is it not the case that on tuesday a high percentage increase was allowed to officials with top salaries who do not need to spend it on necessities and can spend it on enjoyment while the nurses who perform the most essential service given to our community of curing illness and saving life do not even have a wage which could meet first necessities not to speak of enjoyment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the pressure which has been exerted by many members of this house would the government seriously review the arms traffic policy <e> <s> is this not illustrated by the fact that last weekend it was revealed that vickers at barrow-in-furness had built two destroyers for the argentine government sister ships of hms sheffield actually fitted with the exocet missiles <e> <s>

minister for that reply <e> <s> will he confirm that the united nations special assembly in asked this committee to prepare proposals for the abolition of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction and for the phased abolition over years of conventional weapons leading to complete and general disarmament <e> <s> is it not disappointing that the committee has not come to an agreement to carry out those instructions of the united nations assembly <e> <s> does the fact of this division mean that all three proposals will come before the renewed assembly in june <e>", "<cs> my lords

impose decisions upon governments <e> <s> but the resolutions which it adopts will be enormously important in maintaining and strengthening the climate in the world for peace and disarmament <e>",

international action is and what is to be expected from it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in i introduced a bill in another place for a living wage and an eight-hour day for nurses

overseas-student rate so as to encourage more students to come here <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that many occupants of local prisons are now being removed to long-term prisons because of the overcrowding can the minister say whether under this new arrangement there will be better co-ordination between the two than there has been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that his original reply did not tell us much more than that discussions are proceeding <e> <s> can he give us any indication when these discussions are likely to conclude and can he say whether a statement will be made to this house when they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i did not register to speak in this debate <e> <s> i forgot it was necessary to do so on an unstarred question <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e> <s> i feel impelled to say one word in tribute to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for initiating this debate <e> <s> there he is on the front bench deeply involved in many other issues having to give time to it as all front bench men do and yet his humanity was such that he felt it necessary tonight to raise an issue referring to one woman and one child and that is a human attribute to which all of us must pay tribute <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness noted that the british medical association has set up an inquiry into the effectiveness of civil defence in view of the danger of nuclear war and that its introductory paper by experts says that even in the deepest shelter people would be asphyxiated to death <e> <s> in view of those facts would it not be better if concentration was placed upon urging the super powers to end not only nuclear war but chemical warfare and all weapons of mass destruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this question tragically significant because of the assassination this morning of the deputy head of the plo <e> <s> can the minister say whether these specific statements now supported by the plo acceptance in new york of resolution do not provide the opportunity of reconciling palestinian self-determination with israeli security <e> <s> should it not be seized immediately and comprehensively not only to contribute to a solution in the middle east but to end the disastrous conflict in the lebanon <e> <s> does not the fact that there are now in new york the foreign ministers of syria and saudi arabia as well as representatives of the plo make a meeting of the united nations security council possible and promising <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it was inevitable that we should have had from the noble viscount lord trenchard in opening the debate the speech he made and that many subsequent speeches have dealt mostly with the consequences on defence of the recent falklands crisis <e> <s> i wish to follow without his authority the speech which the noble lord lord zuckerman made which dealt with rather more fundamental problems <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the original answer of the minister in which he deprecated documentation to schools <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i misheard <e> <s> i substitute the word <e> <s> is he aware that in a written answer to a question by me this week the government acknowledge that they send to schools their documents about disarmament <e> <s> seriously may i ask him this the united nations has now decided to set up a world disarmament campaign to distribute information <e> <s> will that information be available in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the fact that the impossible dual electoral proposal has been withdrawn may i ask the noble lord whether he can indicate to us what is now the proposal for the election <e> <s> secondly may i ask him whether he is aware that the angolan government have indicated that if the south african troops were withdrawn from namibia a solution in the withdrawal of the cuban armies would be more acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether we can have an assurance that the western governments supplementing the efforts of the unaligned governments will exert the fullest pressure both on the american government and on the soviet union to make the necessary compromises in these discussions to enable a satisfactory solution to be reached <e>", "<cs> but my lords is it not the case as indeed was indicated from the front bench that the soviet union has now agreed to on-the-spot verification in relation to chemical weapons <e> <s> was that not welcomed from the front bench and does that not give us hope that a system of verification may be completed <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the original answer of the minister will the government urge the security council of the united nations to do something more about its admirable resolutions than merely sending observers <e> <s> is it not possible for the security council to establish a united nations peace-keeping force in the lebanon which would have the competence to compel not only the israeli forces to withdraw but also all foreign forces in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister can he confirm that it is the case that approximately nations of the have now indicated that they will support the convention when only are necessary for it <e> <s> can he state whether the government support the attitude of the united states of america which opposes the establishment of an international authority and any provision of technological or computer training to the authority <e> <s> is not the american attitude a denial of the united nations statement that the oceans should become the heritage of mankind and does it not mean instead that they will become the vested interest of the heritage of the multinationals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he can give us an assurance that the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the leader of the house that i gave way to another member and i hope that i may be able to put my supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us had great sympathy with the prime minister in visiting china without the advice of the noble lord lord carrington <e> <s> is it conceivable that she should endorse the immoral treaties imposed on china at the end of the most immoral war this country has ever fought the opium war <e> <s> does he remember that the tories were then in opposition and opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there is a paradox in that while we have refrained from extending democracy in hong kong in order not to offend the chinese government the chinese have now themselves proposed the election of the governor and the association of the people in the administration <e> <s> would he hear in mind that we have years in which to reach a settlement and while it is important that a broad framework of agreement should be reached at an early point embodying the inevitable chinese sovereignty and the necessity for economic prosperity we should leave details in a changing world including the modernisation of china for later consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to proposals of the soviet government being in this document <e> <s> is he aware that it was not a device of the soviet peace committee <e> <s> is he aware that i proposed it and i drafted the terms of the agreement with only slight amendments and that the agreement proposes endorsement of the recommendations of the united nations special assembly four years ago and makes a series of progressive proposals ending with the demilitarisation of both the warsaw pact and nato <e> <s> are not those proposals worthy of the support of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are many issues on which i am not in accord with the soviet government and that i so expressed myself when i was in moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when i went on a peace mission to moscow we had to listen for one hour to a minister in the kremlin trying to prove that soviet forces were not greater than the american forces and i retorted that we would have heard exactly the same in reverse if we had gone to the pentagon <e> <s> does this not illustrate the problem that while there is this difference of opinion about the strength of forces negotiations for arms reductions are bound to be prejudiced <e> <s> would not an uncommitted examination he useful to resolve this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in his original reply the minister referred to the difficulty of finding nonaligned experts <e> <s> does he remember that on the instruction of the united nations general assembly the secretary-general found scientific experts to discuss the question of nuclear weapons headed by a scientist from sweden <e> <s> could not that example be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i speak with some local knowledge that the protest was not initiated by the cnd but by local feeling <e> <s> have operations on this project begun <e> <s> if so was that justifiable in view of the fact that members of the national trust have asked that the matter should be reconsidered and when legal action is being proposed in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the noble lord lord belstead because i do not feel able to stay until the end of this debate <e> <s> like many others i have lost a friend in this house <e> <s> may i also express my appreciation of the maiden speech made by the noble lord who was the governor of hong kong <e> <s> in this house i have criticised the administration of hong kong and that only makes more sincere my appreciation of the speech which he delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords i have dealt with that subject before in this house <e> <s> probably the noble lord was not present when i did so <e> <s> we have reached a common programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to be diverted from my argument <e> <s> i will merely be content to say that while we have come to an agreement with <e>", "<cs> president eisenhower once said that the time would come when the peoples of the world would so demand disarmament that governments would be compelled to accept their demand <e> <s> that movement is now becoming powerful all over the world <e>", "<cs> i believe that we can exert such pressure as to prevent an early nuclear war and that within years we can not only end nuclear weapons in the world <e>", "<cs> but can begin to take steps towards full disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this problem can be solved without linkage to any treatment of independence to namibia <e> <s> is it not the case that the angolan government have said that the cuban troops would be withdrawn from angola if the south african troops were withdrawn from namibia and did not invade angola <e> <s> could not an agreement on those lines be reached without specifically linking it with the treaty of independence <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that this is the most important issue for children and the future of their lives <e> <s> would it not be possible apart from any propaganda for one point of view or the other for older students those aged onwards who are deeply concerned about this issue to be able to hear both points of view or any point of view on this subject so that they may reach their own decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the welcome that the government have given to the report may i ask whether they will carry out their welcome by supporting in the geneva committee on disarmament the comprehensive programme for disarmament that is endorsed in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the answer that the minister gave to my earlier question is he aware that i was not referring only to a test ban on nuclear weapons but to the comprehensive programme for disarmament now being discussed at geneva <e> <s> what is the governments attitude towards that <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers statement covered an extraordinarily wide ground east-west trade the middle east the far east and hong kong relations with the usa central africa and the gatt <e> <s> it had only five words dealing with the most serious economic problem in the world <e> <s> that was a reference to the fact that there is to be consideration of the lom agreement <e> <s> is it not the case that in the third world million people are dying every year from hunger and the absence of medical attention and should not the meeting of ministers have given first attention to the most serious problem of death in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the points made by the noble baroness and the noble lords response to them would the noble lord not agree that the greatest danger to health and safety in prisons is the appalling overcrowding leading to grossly unhygienic conditions and to frustration in turn leading to violence <e> <s> will the government reconsider their refusal to propose an amnesty to many categories of non-violent prisoner in order to relieve this impossible situation <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister read the speech made yesterday by m mitterrand the prime minister of france in which he urged common action on aid to relieve the poverty in the third world which is leading to the death of million children every year <e> <s> will the government get in touch with m mitterrand to seek common action for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not now unrealistic to expect that there could be many survivors from a nuclear attack in view of first the united nations expert statement that a nuclear weapon has now been created which is times as deadly as the one which fell on hiroshima <e>", "<cs> and secondly that the preparatory committee of the medical associations investigation says that even in the deepest shelters people will be choked to death <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord the minister has said regarding the difficulty of differentiating between different countries in giving aid would it not be possible for the government to accept the principle that they will give neither loans nor military aid to any government criticised by the united nations human rights commission for denying human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the report may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that many of us are opposed to sss just as much as to nuclear arms in this country <e> <s> but in view of the fact that the soviet union has now proposed to reduce the number of sss by per cent <e> <s> has proposed to withdraw its missiles largely from central europe and has proposed no first use of nuclear weapons is there not now an opportunity for fruitful negotiations with the soviet union at vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments support of multilateral disarmament will they discuss with the french government their attitude towards the commission in geneva instructed by the united nations second special conference on disarmament to produce a comprehensive programme for peace <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible for the government to adopt a more negotiating attitude <e> <s> is it the case that mr andropov yesterday offered to reduce by more than two-thirds the medium missiles in europe and does this not follow an offer to cut the sss by to withdraw missiles from central europe and to propose that nuclear weapons should not be used first <e> <s> in view of all these offers rather than mere rejection is it not possible to take negotiations when they are made <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers answer referred to american bases in this country <e> <s> would it be possible to have consultations with the new american command for europe which is to be established at high wycombe and with the nato reserve command except for western germany <e> <s> if they are to control the use of weapons in the whole of europe how can there be consultations between our government and them before they are used <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the deep need for a solution to the middle east problem does the noble lord lord skelmersdale not agree that the evidence of all those who have interviewed the arab league and the plo indicates that they would be ready to accept the borders of israel in return for concessions about the west bank and the area of the border and that they are only withholding a declaration for that purpose because of negotiations which are taking place <e> <s> should we not forget what has been said in the past and welcome that indication as a reason for negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his replies have been reassuring but nevertheless is there not an extraordinary contrast here <e> <s> let us suppose the soviet embassy had been guilty of these things <e> <s> imagine the reaction that there would have been in this country <e> <s> should we not show to the south african government a determination that these actions should end <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether when he is considering the possibility of families visiting their relatives in prison he has in mind that some members of these families are ill and that it is impossible for them to make the journey from northern ireland to the isle of wight <e> <s> will he also consider the point that some of these prisoners have a deep longing to return to what they regard as their homeland <e> <s> is it necessary to add that psychological punishment to the punishment of imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that a grant has been made available for the unemployed applicants <e> <s> may i ask him whether that has been extended to old-age pensioners <e> <s> i must declare an interest <e> <s> when i am unable to come to this house i propose to apply to become a student <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard correctly the minister said that authorities had reported to the government <e> <s> is he aware that the actual number is <e> <s> will he confirm that they represent four-fifths of the population of britain including not only greater london but the whole of wales and is not that fact significant in terms of the opinion of the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in order to save injuries and premature deaths the government are now prepared to support the abolition of all nuclear weapon tests including those underground which are now under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that my name is not on the list of speakers <e> <s> i was just too late to get it included <e> <s> perhaps the fact that i was one of those who negotiated this final declaration with the soviet peace committee as chairman of the world disarmament campaign makes it appropriate that i should speak <e> <s> the world disarmament campaign stands for a negotiated world disarmament <e> <s> it is multilateralist <e> <s> it is true that we have the support of unilateralists because they desire the end of nuclear weapons not only in this country but in the world <e> <s> however the main organisations which support the world disarmament campaign are multilateralist <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there will be any restriction on the countries to whom these arms are displayed <e> <s> may i also ask would it not be desirable that the government should not sell arms to repressive countries which have been found guilty by the united nations human rights commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that members of the house on both sides will have rejoiced to hear the voice of the noble lord lord carrington again <e> <s> the regret of some of us that it was not uttered from the government front bench <e> <s> in his forceful and reasoned speech he put forward two fundamental views one was physical and the other was psychological <e> <s> i hope to return to the latter before i conclude <e> <s> his fundamental view in relation to physical affairs was his belief in the nuclear deterrent <e> <s> the noble lord lord carrington knows the deep respect which i have for him but i must confess that i find it difficult to understand how someone of such high intelligence and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government have information about the ghanaian governments projects to re-establish the deportees in farming communities and can the government themselves provide technological assistance for the projects as well as encourage the commonwealth secretariat to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the more flexible attitude on both sides in the geneva talks may i ask the minister first whether it would not be desirable that in public utterances one sought areas of agreement rather than of disagreement and secondly whether it would not be reasonable when balancing the nuclear forces for both sides to include those of france and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is a healthy expansion of democracy in <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister noted that in the annual report of unicef the statement is made that million children died from hunger or from medical neglect and that only each would save children by immunisation from deadly diseases <e> <s> is there a greater need in the whole world to which we should be contributing more generously than to ending this tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government be very careful in considering the recommendations of the select committee in view of the fact that any change in this respect may have a serious effect in the future on any settlement of the irish problem <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first how far is capital investment included in the figures for aid <e> <s> secondly while aid is deeply necessary for the poorest countries are the government giving their mind to proposals for a new world economic order as indicated yesterday in the splendid speech by mrs indira gandhi to the nonaligned nations <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered the report of the committee of moral education of which a roman catholic bishop is the chairman <e> <s> might not this be the solution in view of the many different religions now represented in schools and even some who have no religion <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that many large companies have indicated that they prefer the method of the closed shop would the government in giving consideration to this proposal consider allowing a conscience clause for those who do not wish to be members of a closed shop provided that they give their subscriptions to charities instead of giving them to the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when i asked for a renewal of my passport although i was a member of parliament i was told that i was not a british citizen because i was born in india and my father was born in africa <e> <s> but by simple registration i became a british citizen <e> <s> can there not be a procedure of registration as simple as that by which this problem can be solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while greatly admiring the work of the british council in many respects would not these figures if made available show great discrimination <e> <s> should it not be the policy of the british council in view of the opposition to apartheid by all parties in parliament to encourage those who are deprived of opportunities in south africa due to their ethnic origin <e> <s> if so should not more of those invited in this diversified population represent those who are deprived <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the evidence of teachers in south africa as

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that full reply <e> <s> may i ask whether he would not agree that the decisions at the new new delhi conference should be very seriously considered in view of the fact that they affect nearly two-thirds of the population of the world <e> <s> in view of the comparative deadlock in the discussions between north and south over a period of years leaving million people annually dying from hunger in the third world would the minister not agree that it is necessary to supplement the policy of aid with new economic relationships <e> <s> in view of the fact that such relationships were decided on years ago at bretton woods before the new nations had their independence is it not desirable to seek relationships based on partnership rather than those weighted on the side of the industrialised nations partnership which would include control of the financial institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords in wishing the minister good fortune on his forthcoming visit may i ask him whether the government have reached a decision on the proposal which mrs indira gandhi has made to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government clearly say whether they are in favour or against the ending of weapons in outer space in view of the fact that last december in the united nations assembly they failed to support a motion for ending weapons in outer space <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister while i am opposed to both are not these provisions somewhat similar to those in the british nationality act <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered the desirability of re-calling a world conference on this subject in order to bring pressure to maintain the security of israeli borders and to establish an independent palestine state <e> <s> would not such a world conference be now very desirable in view of the situation in lebanon and the rejection of president reagans proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in

agreement on the document which the non-aligned countries prepared <e> <s> was the difference of opinion on the monitoring of military manoeuvres and on the subject of disarmament <e> <s> what was the attitude of the british government on these issues and was any decision reached regarding a european disarmament conference <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the decision of the government does the

nations passed the resolution to which the minister has referred calling for supervised elections followed by independence cannot the negotiation be speeded up <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the difficulty is the demand by the united states of america and south africa that the withdrawal of cuban troops from angola should be linked with a settlement <e> <s> has he noted the statement of the secretary-general of the united nations that that would be outside the terms of the resolution <e> <s> cannot there be separate negotiations to settle this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while

namely to ask her majestys government whether they will take the initiative to end the confrontation between cyprus and turkey <e>", "<cs> the initiative that i suggested the government should take my lords is action during the debates in the united nations for the proposals which i made <e> <s> when the noble lord the minister says that there has been no request to the government to take the initiative does he not remember that only last week the president of cyprus and the prime minister of greece both appealed for international action and expressed the hope that a debate in united nations may bring that about by the initiatives of governments which are sympathetic <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how dual control can possibly apply to the american reserve command not only for this country but for europe established at high wycombe <e> <s> how can dual control apply to it <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that my noble friend has been very modest in

the preliminary meeting to be held in october in order to prepare for the european disarmament conference in january <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a question about the difficulty that has arisen with malta <e> <s> while it would be inappropriate to hold a european conference on the mediterranean because it would cover north africa and west asia cannot an assurance be given that a separate conference would be held on this important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government urgently give their mind to expediting a settlement of this problem not only because of the atrocities which my noble friend lord hatch of lusby indicated but because every delay is strengthening the position of the illegal south african occupation and the situation is deteriorating so that there is now loss of confidence in the group in the west which has been seeking a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that the most extraordinary thing about this incident is that it should have taken place without any reference whatever to the security council of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords we now revert to the debate on the defence estimates <e> <s> my first word must be to recognise the importance of the maiden speech made by the noble lord lord lewin <e> <s> it was with an authority and a detailed knowledge which must be considered by the government and by all who accept his attitude towards defence <e> <s> he will expect me to say that i differ from that attitude but i appreciate the importance of the expression of that view in the house when we are discussing defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that fact very sincerely <e> <s> i did not think it necessary to mention it because the liberal party had already declared at the general election that it was opposed to trident and the cruise missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the ministers original answer but would he not agree that despite its restricted functions the commission has contributed greatly to racial equality in public places in housing and in employment particularly in the large industries <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the difficulty of communist control of a capitalist economy is not an agreement urgently necessary in view of the deterioration of the hong kong dollar already causing higher prices and unemployment <e> <s> also have not the chinese said that they would impose their own plan if an agreement is not reached by september <e>", "<cs> my lords can something be done to relieve the frustration among the people in hong kong per cent <e> <s> chinese because the talks are conducted by a non-elected governor of a non-elected legislative council <e> <s> could not consultants be appointed to the talks to represent the chinese community <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it is ironic that democracy should be withheld in hong kong for fear of chinese opposition when the chinese themselves are now suggesting that the administration should be selected in consultation with community organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe in the spirit of debate one speech answering another <e> <s> but i think that the noble earl lord kimberley will find that what i say will be in comment on much of what he has said <e> <s> i have said this before but it needs to be said again and again <e> <s> the government have no mandate for deploying cruise missiles in this country <e> <s> in the defence debate i gave the figures of those who had voted for the government and of those who had voted for parties which were against the introduction of the cruise missiles <e> <s> those figures showed that there was a majority of for parties which were opposed to the introduction of the cruise missiles <e> <s> i admit that many vote on other issues but i say to the government that that result indicates that opinion in this country is almost equally divided upon the installation of the cruise missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down again does he deny my statement that at the <e>", "<cs> my lords my opening sentence must be a welcome to the first speech in your lordships house of my noble friend lord tonypandy <e> <s> i have been honoured by friendship with him over many years from tonypandy itself to the houses of parliament <e> <s> we were all charmed by his speech and most of us i think agreed with his conclusions <e> <s> his membership adds distinction to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he really thinks that this contribution is adequate in view of the fact that million people die every year from hunger and from a lack of medical supplies <e> <s> will the noble lord not urge upon his right honourable friend that these contributions should be increased in order perhaps to salve even our own consciences when this human disaster is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government noted the declaration yesterday by the commonwealth ministers conference welcoming a civilian government demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops an early election and a contribution by governments for the restructure of grenada <e> <s> have the government reached any decision about such aid <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from the back-benches repeat my thanks to the noble viscount for repeating this statment and congratulate the government on the very full report which they have made to parliament <e> <s> would he not agree that it is extraordinarily welcome that the commonwealth ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the effect that any accident involving the cruise missiles might have on a large population around them and what is said in the experts report to the united nations would it not be reassuring to have leading scientists in this country carry out an investigation which had the confidence of the people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the camden borough council made an investigation into this practice and found severe discrimination against blacks and asians <e> <s> is he aware that in one case an asian who had lived here for a long time and who spoke english well was required to produce a passport while whites from south africa australia and new zealand are not required to produce their passports even in one case when the three conditions which the home office has laid down were not carried out by that person <e> <s> is not marriage a very personal matter in which these political issues should not be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i heard the last answer correctly <e> <s> have the government replied to the request of the camden borough council that this practice should be amended <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the strength of the demand all over the world for the ending of nuclear weapons not only in europe but in america and in the non-aligned nations japan and australasia will not the government take advantage of the stockholm disarmament conference not merely to demand the monitoring of military manoeuvres and activities but through its terms of reference as a disarmament conference to seek to bring about the ending of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that the delay is due to the wide range of subjects in the proposed comprehensive disarmament programme that the separate subjects have been referred to working groups in the committee at geneva and that there have been differences in those working groups which have caused delays <e> <s> does she agree that it is also due to the fact that the american and british governments opposed the proposal for setting up a working committee on nuclear weapons <e> <s> did not the united nations also say that the committee should make recommendations at the general assembly next year <e> <s> will the government give priority to this subject and see that the comprehensive disarmament programme is considered without undue delay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the proposal for a comprehensive disarmament programme is supported by all the parties in opposition in the british parliament with the exception of the ulster unionists <e> <s> will she therefore seek at the united nations general assembly to expedite the consideration of the proposal before as is now proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i am speaking when my name is not on the distributed list <e> <s> some mistake took place <e> <s> i did give notice just after oclock this morning that i wished to speak <e> <s> i do not criticise the chief whips office <e> <s> all of us who have experience of it are amazed by its efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is the case that at greenham common and similar bases the forces are under an american command and whether that command is not superior to any command over the british forces <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness consider the possibility of the government taking the initiative in order to get an international convention for human rights in view of the fact that a united nations survey shows that countries are denying human rights unfortunately many of them our western allies <e>", "<cs> my lords while deploring the action of the soviet union towards the independent peace activists and the world disarmament campaign of which i was co-chairman were the first to protest may i ask this question <e> <s> is not the cause of human rights indivisible and ought not our government to be protesting in the case of governments which are allied to the west as well as to the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the international scene is a little brighter today than it was when we last discussed foreign affairs and disarmament <e> <s> there is the beginning of a thaw in the icy cold war between the west and the east <e> <s> this is illustrated by the prime ministers visits to budapest in hungary and to moscow in the soviet union and the discussions which took place there <e> <s> it is also illustrated in the new tone of the speeches of president reagan in america and it has been illustrated in a large part of the speech which the noble baroness has delivered today <e> <s> i am going to plead that this thaw be deepened so that within a reasonable period of years there can be sunshine on the international scene <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the warmer climate in international affairs now and the fact that there are three conferences meeting at the present time dealing with disarmament cannot the government take the initiative to raise proposals at these conferences particularly in view of soviet suggestions for ending nuclear weapons in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords as an old rugby player may i ask the government whether they would express to the rugby football union their strong disapproval of the proposed rugby tour of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to this debate one is tempted to spend the short time in which one can speak in commenting upon and answering points that have been made in previous speeches <e> <s> because the subject is so serious i thought carefully about how best to use my time <e> <s> i have come to the conclusion that the most constructive contribution one can make is to look at the proposals which have been made for containing and for ending nuclear war and to ask in respect of many of them what is the view of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that all of us declare ourselves to be in favour of peace including the government is it not reasonable that children whose future life will be involved should be allowed to make studies of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords my first words must be to express appreciation to my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for initiating this debate <e> <s> i am not saying that in any formal way <e> <s> it is so appropriate that we should be debating this issue at this time just before decisions will be taken on the issue in the rugby world <e> <s> i add to that appreciation of his initiative an appreciation of his speech <e> <s> i felt at the end of the speech that there was no need for any more of us to put the case which he was arguing <e> <s> it was informed convincing and practical <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have misrepresented the position but i understood that the rugby board controlling the rugby game not the rugby union but the rugby board had a vast majority of white players on it and only two native africans <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be a little misinformed but the case about the majority the vast majority remains <e> <s> i was going to go on to say this <e> <s> while these concessions have been made segregation in rugby is still at the root the rule in south africa <e> <s> boys who are black are not allowed at their schools to play with white students <e> <s> they grow up to their teens and they begin their rugby careers with a sense of that segregation and of that discrimination <e> <s> right through <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the unsatisfactory accommodation in the old prisons and the overcrowding in most prisons will the government concentrate on reducing the prison population <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the people of hong kong are to be given any opportunity to express their view regarding the agreement before it is put into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that in the situation of a declaration of war where by decisions made in seconds millions of lives on one side or the other may be lost real discussion is impossible and the use of a veto is impossible <e> <s> is that not emphasised by the fact that at greenham common where the cruise missiles are based the supreme command is in american hands <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the admitted fact that a nuclear war would mean the loss of millions of people and vast populations would the government not make a positive initiative to try to remove this danger <e> <s> for example would it not test the sincerity of the soviet proposal that the whole of europe from the atlantic to the urals should be free of nuclear weapons <e> <s> can the government not respond to that and other proposals which are being made for an ending of this danger <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the government have said in response to the soviet idea of no first use of nuclear weapons that they are prepared to say there will be no first use of any weapons cannot an agreement covering both those elements be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is very deeply impressed by the construction of the motorways may i ask how the expenditure on them compares with the expenditure on providing new houses for the homeless and the overcrowded <e>", "<cs> my lord will the noble baroness agree that it is an extraordinary situation when practically the whole world and the security council of the united nations regard south african occupation of namibia as illegal that it should have continued for so many years even to the point of interference with the courts <e> <s> in view of the failure of the talks in zambia last week will the government again raise that issue in the security council with a view to ending that impossible situation <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two preliminary remarks which i feel i must make <e> <s> the first is to thank my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for introducing this debate and to express <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first does he not agree that authoritative surveys have indicated that the growth of population decreases with a higher standard of living <e> <s> therefore would not the government meet this problem by seeking world action to lift the standard of the hungry people of the third world <e> <s> secondly does not the growth of population require greater food production <e> <s> is it not now possible that the deserts of the world could be used by world action to produce the necessary extra food to meet the growth of population <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how famous are our leading teaching hospitals in london throughout the world <e> <s> is he aware that in america west germany and india i have heard praise particularly of st thomas and of its consultants <e> <s> with thousands of pounds now being spent on equipment in order to make st thomas the equal of any hospital in the world would it not be disastrous if there were any rumours that it was to be closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord mottistone will excuse me if i do not follow him by commenting on his speech <e> <s> i do not intend to deal with the details of the defence estimates <e> <s> i heard with dismay the recitation of the increases in armaments which were announced by the minister <e> <s> i want to deal with a rather more fundamental issue and it may surprise the opposite bench if i do so in congratulation of the government <e> <s> i want to repeat and emphasise what my noble friend lord boston of faversham said in his speech in appreciation of what the government are doing in initiating the outlawing of chemical weapons <e> <s> mr richard luce the minister of state took the initiative at the conference in geneva in his working paper <e> <s> that has now been followed by a draft treaty which the united states of america has introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> may i make one correction <e> <s> there should be no reference in the question to argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that this appeal was initiated by the world parliamentarians <e> <s> they are distinguished members of all parties in countries <e> <s> is he also aware that they intend to follow up that initiative by sending deputations to the governments of all countries possessing nuclear weapons and may we have an assurance that such a deputation would be received at high level in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister said in reply to me that the soviet union can renew talks and that its failure to do so is the reason for deadlock <e> <s> would not the noble lord the minister agree that the situation is so serious that despite that we must seek every opportunity to look for a solution to the problem of nuclear weapons <e> <s> do not the conferences on disarmament in geneva and stockholm give the government an opportunity to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the non-violent protest of the women at greenham common has made a profound impression on the public opinion of this country and has increased the demand for peace from this government and from other governments <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government accept the principle of self-determination by the people of these territories as to who should govern them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is an organisation of ex-generals and admirals of both the west and the east and even those who have commanded united nations forces <e> <s> is she further aware that its purpose is to prevent a nuclear war with all its threat to mankind <e> <s> is that not the stated purpose of the government and therefore should not this organisation be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords having worked over many years with the indian prime minister i find it difficult to speak

an ability of argument which really made it quite distinctive <e> <s> he is a relative of a former statesman of this country and the ability of his argument showed that there is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that wages councils were established i think in the first decade of this century to protect the wages of large numbers of people engaged in sweated labour particularly home workers and that my noble friend lord shinwell and i both gave evidence about those <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the progressive attitude that the churches are now taking on human suffering and human equality not only in this country but throughout the world in latin america and southern africa do not the churches now deserve commendation rather than condemnation <e>", "<cs> my lords my first words must be to congratulate my noble friend lord molloy on his fortune in winning the ballot for this debate on his selection of subject and in the moving speech with which he initiated it <e> <s> whatever our views i think we all appreciated it very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble baroness whether her majestys government have considered the alternative of placing gibraltar and indeed all the ports of entry to inland seas under the authority of the united nations so that their neutrality can be preserved <e> <s> if the government have not considered that can the noble baroness inform the house why not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether in the light of the enormous usefulness and convenience of these telephone boxes when they are being replaced a tribute will be paid to fred jowett who was commissioner of works and installed them as far back as <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether non-governmental organisations will be able to give evidence to this conference <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the question put from the opposition front bench and the noble lords answer i should like to ask whether it is recognised that agricultural development in the continent of africa is absolutely necessary particularly as a contribution to ending the appalling famine that is taking place there <e> <s> in view of those facts will the government increase their contribution and provide technical assistance to african governments to develop their own agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion directs one to speak about the terrible happenings in east africa <e> <s> the most useful thing i can do is to propose international action which would prevent their recurrence or which would at least prevent their worst features

agree that it is inconsistent with the antiapartheid policy of the government that they should be supporting the investment in south africa of millions of pounds which is maintaining the apartheid system <e> <s> is not profit being placed before principle <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have declared themselves in favour of the final document of the united nations special session on disarmament will they at least assure the soviet leader that they support the four recommendations <e> <s> they are first the abolition of nuclear weapons secondly the progressive abolition of conventional weapons thirdly general and complete disarmament and fourthly the transference of military expenditure to ending poverty in the world <e> <s> does the minister recall that only seven years ago all the governments of the world supported those four recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords in applying their policy of lower wages can the government not have consideration for those who are on the lowest level <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the wages councils have saved thousands of people from being driven below the hunger level <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that in addition to the repression of self-determination in east timor the indonesian <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the signs that in south africa there is beginning in a small way a civil war which if it escalated would have a deplorable effect may i ask the minister whether the government will take the initiative in the security council of the united nations to find a way in which world opinion against apartheid can be reflected including the possibility of sanctions against south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is the case that governments have ratified this convention <e> <s> does she remember that in a written answer to a question asked by me she has stated that the government are considering ratifying it but are concerned whether ratification would not be in accordance with certain domestic policies <e> <s> i may not have heard but can she state what those contradictions may be <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the security council has made its proposals for the independence of namibia and that the south african government has for more than a decade delayed that solution and is even now proposing its own constitution for namibia is it beyond the wit of man and the ability of the security council to reflect world opinion on this issue and find a means of enforcing the solution which it has itself proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness not agree that there is a contradiction in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the restraint of the government in not deporting mr and mrs nicola during the three months that they were in sanctuary in an anglican church may i ask whether the government will reconsider this matter for three reasons <e> <s> will he confirm that in refugees who came were given indefinite leave to remain <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that mr nicola was unable to come in because he was conscripted into the army to fight the turkish invasion <e> <s> thirdly since it has been suggested that mr and mrs nicola were in hiding and taking part in deception

refugees <e> <s> is it not a fact that they were expelled from their home by the turkish invaders that they lived as refugees in appalling conditions in camps and that mr nicola was conscripted and prevented from coming to this country in when if he had done so he would have had indefinite leave <e> <s> i beg the minister to look at this issue again in a sympathetic way <e>", "<cs> my lords may

is passed <e> <s> the first is to express an appreciation which i am sure is shared by all the back-benchers on this side of the house and indeed by many others of the way in which my noble friend lady birk and her team have conducted their opposition to this bill <e> <s> it has been done with a thoroughness and a detail an ability an ingenuity and a persistence that have been a great parliamentary performance <e> <s> i extend that appreciation to the constructive proposals which have so often been made by the spokesmen of the liberal party and the social democratic party <e> <s> i even extend it if i may to the noble lord lord elton for the good humoured and knowledgeable way in which he has made the best case for what we regard as a very bad case <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the reduction in unemployment announced today and i do not wish to be partisan <e> <s> however is the minister aware of the depressing psychological effect of unemployment on thousands or even millions of people in this country in particular young school leavers who become anti-social in a society which does not want them <e> <s> is not something serious happening as a result of unemployment to the relationship of many thousands of people towards the community <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that wages councils have saved thousands of people from being driven down

ask her whether she does not agree that the overwhelming vote of over against three indicates the strength of world opinion in favour of ending all nuclear weapons tests <e> <s> may i ask her whether the attitude of the united states great britain and france does not provide some basis for the feeling which the prime minister found at the commonwealth conference that the western nuclear powers are

acknowledgement <e> <s> like other back-benchers i normally do my own research for my speeches here but not on this occasion <e> <s> i have had the invaluable help of joan hymans a foundation member of the anti-apartheid movement in what i am going to say and i wish to thank her <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question of the noble viscount the leader of the house <e> <s> are we to have an opportunity to pay some tribute to the late <e>", "<cs> did he not serve longer than anyone else in the two houses of parliament <e> <s> should we not recognise that <e>", "<cs> my lords what has happened is a deep humiliation both to the foreign secretary and to the prime minister <e> <s> they were persuaded that apartheid could be ended by reasonable discussion <e> <s> the foreign secretary travelled half-way round the world to discuss this matter with president botha of south africa <e> <s> he was given a colossal snub <e> <s> the south african head of government even refused to consider the proposals that he was going to make <e> <s> both the foreign secretary and the prime minister must feel utterly humiliated by what has occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to sound a warning against the possibility of limited sanctions <e> <s> they would fail <e> <s> all history shows the ability of governments when foreign action is taken to adjust themselves to it <e> <s> apartheid is not just a matter of rules regulations and adminstration it is as my noble friend lord hatch of lusby pointed out in his remarkable speech during the south african debate a way of life for the afrikaners who rule the south african government <e> <s> only a fundamental change of power will end that <e> <s> i have no doubt that in the long run apartheid will be abolished but i am fearful and pessimistic about the means of that realisation <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be a blood bath in south africa and a war in the world <e> <s> i conclude by urging intervention by united nations forces if apartheid is ultimately to be overthrown <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if there is truth in the allegation by the noble lord lord chalfont that the world peace council is behind the world congress for the international year of peace in copenhagen it has succeeded to an extent which is against its own interests <e> <s> is the minister aware that there are at that conference a large number of non-aligned nations who are not pro-soviet and even representatives of western peace movements <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to take advantage of the standing orders which allow questions to he put and some comments to be made <e> <s> may i first thank the noble baroness not only for her preliminary statement but for the answers which she has given to points which have been raised <e> <s> on the whole i think that most of us would regard what she has said as hopeful <e>", "<cs> president reagan has made a strong appeal to mr gorbachev to move towards another summit <e> <s> mr gorbachevs speech envoy viktor karpov has said that the soviet union is prepared to negotiate agreement independently of <e>", "<cs> my lords the speech of the noble lord lord avebury was so thorough and comprehensive and was supported by such a remarkable citation of facts that i can be brief in my contribution to this debate <e> <s> i shall confine myself to incidental comments <e> <s> perhaps i may first apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> lord reay for my inability to hear which prevented me despite his strong voice from following the whole of his speech therefore i shall be unable to reply to it point by point and in detail <e> <s> what i heard impressed me as making a case which it is desirable to answer and i have not often regretted my lack of hearing more than when i listened to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that some of the comments which i shall make during my remarks may be accepted by him as being some reply to his contribution to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the queens speech includes a promise by the government to continue to attach <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government progressively reconsider their attitude on this question <e> <s> would not this step be part of a great progress towards ending the danger of a nuclear war and has it not overwhelming support in the world with the exception of the president of the united states and of our government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it would be of enormous value to the peace of the world if the united states and the soviet union could come to an agreement to cut strategic weapons and perhaps eliminate bilateral weapons and should not our government be co-operating with them to bring that about <e> <s> secondly has he foreseen the possibility that after the next election there will be a majority in the house of commons against trident <e> <s> is it not a vast waste of money to be spending these enormous sums on its production <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness how long the government are prepared for the present situation in namibia to continue <e> <s> can they not urge in the security council that a strong united nations peacekeeping force should enter namibia to take control of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recollect that four recommendations were made at the first special session <e> <s> the first was the abolition of all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction <e> <s> the second the phased abolition over the years of conventional weapons led to the third general and complete disarmament except for internal security and contributions to the united nations peacekeeping force <e> <s> the fourth recommendation was the transference of military expenditure to development to end <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether it is not a fact that on the prime ministers visit to moscow she carried out the activities which are described in my question on south africa <e> <s> historically is not south africa far more important to us than the soviet union <e> <s> therefore should we not be active in south africa on behalf of those who are denied human rights to the same degree at least that we are in the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness for her reply to me and ask her whether it would not highlight the coming general election if a statement were made during the campaign that britain was not only opposed to apartheid in word but was prepared to take action as suggested in my question to end it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords what action do her majestys government take to ensure that the department of trade and industry actively discourages investment in south africa and the sale of oil to south africa indirectly by transfer through ships of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what action the government are taking to ensure that the department of trade and industry actively discourages investment in south africa <e>", "<cs> and in particular the sale of oil to south africa indirectly <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e> <s> i withdraw the question which i have just put and ask instead this question <e> <s> is it not more likely to end the war if an embargo is imposed on both participants <e> <s> is this not especially the case in view of the fact that the soviet union is more likely to support it <e>"]
