["<cs> my lords i ask the indulgence of the house as i seek to address it for the first time <e> <s> every noble lord who has made his maiden speech in this house will know exactly how i feel at this moment <e> <s> i made my original maiden speech to another place in this very chamber years ago and naturally i see on benches here people who were in that parliament so memories crowd in on me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the statement <e> <s> is he aware of the increased difficulty in getting investment into south wales as long as there is fear about the bridge <e> <s> i join the noble lord in saying that we do not want people to be alarmed but they are already thoroughly fed up with the long delays in getting across that bridge and it is a very expensive business for industry in south wales <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether the statement about contingency plans will be forthcoming within the next month because we need to know about contingency plans if we are to attract industry to south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord prys-davies for the way in which he opened this debate <e> <s> it is just years since i had the great honour of being <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take back the message that this country is united behind the statements that have been made by the prime minister for us all and that that is what we would expect of a prime minister of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the mining communities are closely linked and that they are good loyal patriotic people <e> <s> would we not be very wise at this time to say nothing but to leave those who are responsible to try to reach an agreement <e> <s> my father was a miner my brother was a miner all my teenage friends were miners and i hate to see one being set against another <e> <s> i hope that in this house at least we shall not try to score off each other <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will reject this amendment <e> <s> i have listened with anxious concern to those who appear to believe that there should be no restraints of any sort at all <e> <s> the argument which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has been using against any form of censorship would allow the filth of gutter to be available for our children <e>", "<cs> if this amendment goes through we might as well abandon the bill <e> <s> this amendment is really striking against any action against video nasties and i think we ought to come to a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is quite wrong for any community in this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it would be unfortunate if the impression were given that the teaching profession in this country is unreliable <e> <s> would he also agree that we are very fortunate as regards the overwhelming mass of dedicated men and women who serve in our state schools and no doubt in the private sector as well <e> <s> would he further agree that to try to catch those people who fall below professional standards and there are people in every profession who do that from time to time by formalising the situation would as he very wisely indicated be a great mistake and would upset an honourable profession <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the government persist in wanting to change our sunday they will be asking for trouble and they have enough already <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened with the utmost respect to my noble friend lord shackleton and to the noble lord lord balfour who is against privilege <e> <s> of course in this house there are privileged classes <e> <s> we are all privileged just to be here <e> <s> and we represent ourselves <e> <s> we have been elected to represent no one else that i know of <e> <s> as to statements of policy by her majestys government and everyone being free to make a speech perhaps i may say that the two years that i have had the privilege of being in your lordships house have taught me that brevity is unknown in this place <e> <s> with all its faults the other place through the speaker makes it possible for people to realise that they cannot get in when everything has been said just to repeat it and to be heard <e> <s> the select committee of this house has spent a long time on this matter <e> <s> it must have gone into the question in depth <e> <s> it would not have come to the house with these proposals if it had not felt them to be in the interests of the house itself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that honourable members of another place and noble lords do not require an extension of parliamentary privilege so that they would be treated differently from any other member of the country when it comes to the inquiries of our security authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords while i join with other noble lords in regretting the unfortunate breakdown of the talks and am in no way seeking to join with those trying to find out which side has the most terrorists in the middle east is it not clear that the line her majestys government have declared to the world is that britain insists on the right of israel to exist at peace within her own boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this subject may i ask the minister whether he is aware how deeply public opinion is on his side and that of the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble baroness lady seear in regarding this as a national issue in which the police are our barrier for our parliamentary democracy <e> <s> if the police were not there the bully boys would indeed take over <e> <s> but there appear to be people <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be advisable for this house to leave to another house and those who are elected the question of deciding parliamentary boundaries <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister of the opinion that it is asking for trouble between both houses if we seek to decide constituency boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great privilege to follow the noble lord lord sainsbury who speaks with great authority on the retail industry <e> <s> i noticed that in his concern for the employment protection of people he passed by the fact that immediately the act becomes law anyone employed afterwards has no protection <e> <s> people have to agree to work on sunday or the chances are that they will not be employed <e>", "<cs> no of course there is protection <e> <s> i am glad i am touching a nerve <e> <s> because once this bill is through they will be told that <e> <s> once this bill is through the protection has gone <e> <s> it applies only to those who are in the industry now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord butterworth has given signal service in the field of education and the noble lord lord houghton proved he was a good friend to teachers when the salary award was made many years ago <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby who apparently had a different kind of teacher when he was young from the kind that i had <e> <s> it was my privilege to be nurtured in the schools of the rhondda valley <e> <s> my credentials on this side should be very good indeed <e> <s> i did not see a conservative until i was <e> <s> i have said this before to the noble lord who sits here with me and who is a friend of mine <e> <s> i found that the only difference was that the conservatives had better suits than we did <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform me despite the wishy-washy attitude of the right reverend prelates on this question whether her majestys inspectors of schools are required to inform the secretary of state as to whether the law is being fulfilled with regard to the daily act of worship <e> <s> the right reverend prelates speak for the church of england but they do not speak for everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not still a requirement that the terms of the education act should be fulfilled by local education authorities <e> <s> is the minister aware that however many church people were on this committee it is not a fact that the majority of schools are multi-faith <e> <s> it is not a fact that in the greater part of this country there are many faiths <e> <s> in some of our big cities there are schools predominant with another faith <e> <s> is she also aware that many of us are deeply anxious that at this particular time our children should have a good grounding in the christian faith in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not insulting to those who are unemployed to suggest that they are more likely to resort to crime <e> <s> i consider it thoroughly offensive to a large proportion of our public <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak in support of the amendment that has been proposed <e> <s> i wish to bring to the attention of the committee an experience that i had when i was responsible as parliamentary under-secretary in the home office for dealing with questions of immigration <e> <s> at a time when there was a great deal of immigration into our country i am talking of very little came to the ministers compared with the number of cases that were dealt with by officials <e> <s> but we are i believe in grave danger of imposing on a carrier a sense of dreadful responsibility if he knows that a person is in grave danger <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord in answering the noble lord lord cledwyn bear in mind that the welsh office has responsibility for health and education in wales and that it is ordinary common courtesy for consideration to be given to the matters raised by the noble lord <e> <s> secondly will he bear in mind that it is to the governments own advantage to have the experience and knowledge of practising teachers on this important body <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if he is as wise as i believe him to be he will not touch this matter at all <e> <s> he will leave it to the common sense of the british people <e> <s> illogical or not they like their british sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with great pleasure to my noble friend lord wyatt of <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister apparently believes in the infallibility of the governments judgment on this matter <e> <s> therefore will be accept that there is in this country a deep disquiet about young people in danger and about the effect on family life <e> <s> while i realise that all governments are entitled to choose their priorities will he convey to his colleagues in the government and to his right honourable friend the secretary of state that there is deep disquiet because the matter to which the noble baroness has drawn our attention is being pushed further away and it should be reconsidered <e>", "<cs> my lords while we appreciate that the minister is unable to say anything further about the calling in of this application will he convey to his right honourable friend that there is great optimism created by the fact that it has been called in <e> <s> we have very great faith that the secretary of state for wales will realise that this is one of our most attractive places and that it should be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble baroness for the spirit of that reply may i ask her whether she can confirm that there are over of these children but that there are training places available for only <e> <s> will she be kind enough to publish the replies to the questionnaire which her department sent to local authorities in <e>", "<cs> i can hardly believe my ears <e> <s> it is sad for me to listen to those who are entrusted with the protection of the faith and to realise that we have been told this afternoon that it may be necessary to come back on report and not to have the word christian in the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i had the feeling clearly i was wrong that he wanted a free hand to negotiate on this question <e> <s> i believe in every fibre of my being that there are some things on which we cannot afford to compromise <e> <s> the heritage of our faith must be passed to our children <e> <s> if we turn our backs on that we shall have betrayed our generation <e> <s> i apologise to the right reverend prelate for having misunderstood something that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i recently spent a considerable time in south africa <e> <s> i visited many shanty towns as i would call them the zinc houses where i would not choose to live but where i learnt of the deep divisions among the black people about sanctions <e> <s> i saw in khayelitsha which is a name not unknown to people in south africa slogans printed on some of these zinc <e>", "<cs> my lords when i made my maiden speech in another place years ago the speaker who followed me was the gentleman who is now the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> he was very kind to me as is customary in the other place as everyone will know <e> <s> i shall be kind to him now <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with great respect to the consistent views expressed by the noble lord <e> <s> i have known him for over years and he has never changed his views <e> <s> he does not like the teaching of the christian faith <e> <s> i accept <e>", "<cs> the discussions were in my lords <e> <s> it was quite clear that thanks to his convictions and ours we had agreed syllabuses across the land <e> <s> the anxiety of the government then was entirely different from anxieties today <e> <s> then it was catholic and protestant quarrelling with each other or being suspicious of each other <e> <s> we heard the right reverend prelate explain that now there is unity on this question between roman catholics and protestants <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while there are differences among the teaching unions there is unanimity that they dislike having settlements imposed upon them by her majestys government however generous the government may think them to be <e> <s> is she further aware that eminently reasonable people within the teaching profession consider that it is not part of our parliamentary democratic process for government to behave in quite such a high-handed manner <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout the house there will be noble lords who are concerned with various childrens organisations <e> <s> it is my privilege to be linked with the national childrens home <e> <s> i have not read the report but having listened to the minister this afternoon i too should like to express deep gratitude to the learned judge and her colleagues <e> <s> my heart goes out to the people of cleveland who i am sure are no different from those in the rest of the country <e> <s> they have been singularly unfortunate to have had a shadow cast over them which no other part of the united kingdom would wish to have <e> <s> i hope that after a reasonable period when we have had a chance to consider the report in detail we shall have an opportunity for debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the noble lord lord jenkins with great interest <e> <s> the other place has a right to be jealous of its privileges <e> <s> they go back a long way <e> <s> this house has always been jealous of those privileges because real power lies there <e> <s> we are fortunate on some amendments that the speaker was prepared to put them to the other place at all <e> <s> on more than one occasion i exercised that right and said to the other place i shall not put the amendment to the house because the other place has exceeded its powers <e> <s> this house then accepted that ruling <e> <s> it had no choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope as we approach a decision that the house will hesitate long and hard before it throws back in the face of another place the claim it has held for centuries namely the claim about controlling expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords some have been arguing to that effect <e> <s> we have just heard a noble lord do that <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case perhaps i may say to the noble lord that i am very pleased that this house is acknowledging the rights and privileges of the house of commons which is the elected chamber in our parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is much easier in the quiet of this chamber to give advice to the israelis on how to deal with what is a very difficult situation and that there ought to be a little more sympathy for those who are trying to bring law and order into that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i apologise to the noble lord lord macaulay for having interrupted his speech <e> <s> i am very glad that i listened to him though he ended up in the same state as the government not knowing quite what to do and seeking the advice of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> however in stripping of their ameican citizenship those who are charged the usa is taking very serious steps against the people concerned <e> <s> if they are then sent back to the country whence they came they may well be put on trial <e> <s> so the united states is not taking the line which says send for the bowl of water <e> <s> we shall wash our hands and say that this is not for us <e> <s> we are above it <e> <s> we shall forget what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not asked to do that as i understand it <e> <s> all that we are asked to do when there is sufficient evidence is to ensure that there is a prosecution <e> <s> as i understand it that is all that we are asked to do <e> <s> i thought that above all this house stood for law and order <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government giving consideration to preventing these public exhibitions in which the moslems seem to believe that they have a right to take over our streets and call for the death of whatever person has been condemned by the ayatollah <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that he sounded uncharacteristically unkind about those who live in tied cottages <e> <s> very often they are the people who especially deserve extra consideration <e> <s> will he not go back to his office and return with a kinder attitude than he has shown this afternoon which is quite out of character with what we usually receive from him <e>", "<cs> my lords as all the schools were re-opened in july and as the further education colleges were opened in january of this year would it not be helpful if those who have influence in the arab world tried to stop the universities being used as centres of terrorism in order that israel might re-open the universities as well as it is eager to do <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the comments from those who know the area best will we have an opportunity to discuss the matter or will the minister take the decision in the light of the information he will gather <e> <s> will we have a further chance to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will forgive a welshman for entering into the debate <e> <s> has the kirk of scotland commented on the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that another place which is answerable to the people as a whole in this land rejected out of hand a proposal to make sunday like any other day <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that a great many people in this land hope that no government will ever make sunday lose its special distinction as a reminder that this is still a christian land <e>", "<cs> my lords three major issues have emerged in the course of our debate <e> <s> i am sorry about my voice and i hope that the house will be patient <e> <s> the three main questions before us are the morality of prosecution at all retrospection in legislation and the constitutional issue upon which i shall say a few words later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am astonished that some noble lords no single one in particular who are learned in the law should jump to conclusions without even reading the evidence <e> <s> it is astonishing to me that high court judges should come heie and tell us what we ought to do when they have not even read what hetherington and chalmers said <e> <s> the government or the home secretary at least and i presume the prime minister if i know her will have read it all right <e> <s> those who read it voted to support the bill <e> <s> i say to noble lords on the opposition benches that we shall be giving a good weapon to those who want to end this house if tonight the government are defeated <e> <s> let us remember that the bill is a government bill it is not a private members bill <e> <s> if tonight this chamber defeats the government noble lords on the opposition benches will know what to expect <e> <s> i hope they will stay and vote against the amendment <e> <s> the only way to protect our unwritten constitution is to ensure that we keep our power to be a revising chamber and not take the ultimate step of throwing the bill out <e> <s> i propose to vote for the second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone is aware of the anomalies linked with sunday trading <e> <s> are the government of the opinion that sundays should always be a special day or have they decided to amend the commandments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord that he puts what the honourable member said into his own words <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness also express her gratitude to the countless people who are raising money because they realise as pointed out by the noble lord lord mellish that there never will be enough money for the health service <e> <s> for instance people in the valleys of south wales are raising great sums of money for scanners and for other ancillary purposes connected with hospitals <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the noble lord lord houghton because he has reduced the bishops bench by per cent <e> <s> i listened as the committee listened almost with relish to the noble lord <e> <s> for nigh on years in another place or in this place it has been my privilege to listen to him <e> <s> he knows my views and by this time i know his <e> <s> he is a preacher <e>", "<cs> my lords it is eight years ago that parliament was summoned back from the recess because of military action involving our own forces <e> <s> i never will forget the high sense of drama in another place especially on the first day of the falklands debates <e> <s> the house was united both sides called for actions not words <e> <s> the country was united but that was an issue which concerned our country alone <e> <s> today we have been recalled because there is a watershed in world affairs <e> <s> what happens to the united nations is now at stake and what happens to the united nations will decide human rights across the world for generations yet unborn <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have no sympathy at all with his noble friend and the question that he has asked <e> <s> is he further aware that there is no public clamour at all for a change in our british sunday <e> <s> however it might be helpful and remove anomalies if all commerce were forbidden on sunday <e> <s> i would support that <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to the noble baroness lady cox i was reminded yet again that there is a simple issue before the house <e> <s> another place inserted a clause which completely changed what was hitherto before this house when the bill left us <e> <s> another place decided to insert a clause which i am advised would have the effect of ending the link with the infant life preservation act the severing of which by the commons means that abortion is available until birth <e> <s> if that is true then it cannot be denied that an abortion when a living creature is waiting to emerge is no less than murder <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot understand how anyone can suggest that the house is considering the same issue as it considered previously <e>", "<cs> my lords both the right honourable member and the honourable member made clear at the press conference that they were misled <e> <s> i want no one in this house to be misled <e> <s> i want no one at all to be able to say well i did not realise that we were giving to some doctors a right to behave as though they were god almighty with the gift of life or death <e> <s> that is not the right of any calling or profession <e> <s> i hope and pray that the house will realise that although as the noble baroness made clear we want an emphasis on saving the life of the mother where a perfectly viable baby can be born we shall not give authority to anyone to put it to death <e>",

i was given the details of a person without arms or legs <e> <s> i did not meet him <e> <s> he is holding down a job because the department of employment and the department of health have devised a means of helping grotesquely injured people to find fulfilment in life <e>", "<cs> my lords they will be deciding if there is to be a late abortion <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the noble baroness lady warnock with some dismay <e> <s> we heard her say that the mother might say that she did not want the child <e> <s> i happen to have other beliefs <e> <s> without being certain of the
