["<cs> i want to urge the government whenever they are asked to do anything sensible not to say that they cannot do it <e> <s> this is what one is always advised when in government <e> <s> one is always told from the draftsmans point of view that one must not say anything in case it implies the opposite somewhere else <e> <s> everybody knows that this is complete nonsense <e> <s> just as over the industry matter which i hope the noble lord will bring up again at report this is an entirely new aspect one which has never before been in an education bill <e> <s> it is sensible to bring to the attention of governing bodies and local authorities <e> <s> it makes complete sense <e> <s> i hope that the government will resist the advice which i am absolutely sure they are being given that by putting this amendment in they may create difficulties concerning somebody else later on <e> <s> i believe this to be foolish untrue and unworthy of them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment he ought to take some notice of the feelings on this side of the committee <e> <s> i thought that the argument put forward by the noble baroness was extremely ingenious but not in fact correct <e> <s> if you have parents of disabled children two of them among your governors they may or may not be suitable to give other people advice on how to deal with other children <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason to suppose that they will be suitable <e> <s> if they are suitable this is a permissive not a mandatory amendment there is no need to do more than pay attention <e> <s> but the idea that any two parents of disabled children are able to give the kind of advice and the kind of practical help that is required in special schools seems to me to be purely wrong <e> <s> as the noble baroness is saying in essence that she agrees with us that it is already doing it i think it would be comforting to us if she would look at this again <e> <s> i do not believe she is already doing it <e>", "<cs> an ingenious mind anyway <e>", "<cs> before this matter is decided i wish to express great discomfort about the present situation <e> <s> we on this side are being pushed into a position where it is suggested that we are against parents having choice <e> <s> that is not only nonsense but everyone who says it knows jolly well that it is nonsense <e> <s> it should not be said <e> <s> it was said to me again and again during the debate on our education bill and i lost my temper every single time <e> <s> it is an absolutely intolerable and dishonest argument <e>", "<cs> i must add one word to the extraordinarily clear explanation just given to the committee of exactly what the argument is about because this concerns the entire bill <e> <s> there are a number of other things in the bill which we do not like but this is the centre of what we do not like <e> <s> we had this argument when i was in the noble ladys position for what seemed like months two or three years ago and i do not think a single member of the opposition side ever spoke up in favour of the -plus <e> <s> i know that some noble lords were not here and might have done so had they been here <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter might have spoken in favour of it if he had been here but he was not <e> <s> in the course of those three or four months i do not believe i ever had to attack the -plus as put forward by somebody from the other side <e> <s> one always found them saying i am not going to defend the -plus but i just wanted to add that to what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> i was expecting the minister to give us the answer which i thought i had got <e> <s> i was so sure that he would give it that i did not bother to make reference to the fact that this point is covered by an earlier finance act <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble minister has that but i think it was but i cannot remember what section <e> <s> i was advised that this was covered by that act and therefore this is unnecessary <e> <s> if that is not the case i think his answer is not entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke on this in committee and i want to speak on it again <e> <s> my belief is that the correct and best course that the national heritage act and fund can pursue is summed up in clause <e> <s> i wish to see the trustees looking after all affairs to do with both real property and chattels in lieu and otherwisebut i do not think it is desirable to push this through against the fairly strong opposition of half the customers that is the museums <e> <s> therefore i have a certain sympathy with the minister for the arts who wrote this letter and i have to confess that i think it was a mild indiscretion to put it on paper <e> <s> i have sympathy with him and if i were in his position i do not think i should want to force this through if one of the beneficiaries was strongly against it <e> <s> this blocks the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what possible reason there could be for moving amendments on third reading when they have not been moved tonight <e> <s> what is the object <e> <s> why were they not moved tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the prime minister and her majesty the queen will not appoint somebody who is so rich and so retired that he does not think before he acts which is what it seemed to me the noble lord was saying we could expect from the chairman <e> <s> i think i must have misunderstood him but that is what he seemed to me to say <e> <s> at the end of our deliberations it would be a pity to divide again as the cohorts which always lurk behind the front bench are all having supper and i cannot see any point in putting to a vote something which we are bound to lose by an enormous amount <e> <s> so i shall advise my noble friend that i do not think it is worth pursuing though i think that the government will be quite wrong as is often the case <e>", "<cs> i am a little unhappy about this <e> <s> i am not asking that any power should be taken away from anybodyi am asking that a duty should be put <e>", "<cs> the two speakers from the liberal benches have clarified my approach very well <e> <s> what i want is for it to be the responsibility of the local authority to tell the people living in their area what is available in the way of education in that area <e> <s> i do not of course mean that they have to prepare it themselves <e> <s> they will get it from the governors as the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord ought to look at this again <e> <s> i am not going to divide the committee because i do not think it is of sufficient importance because it is halfway there <e> <s> but the noble lord is leaving the ordinary parent in a particular local authority where no agreement has been made to search out in different pages in different educational journals to find out what is available <e> <s> doubtless they can ask their friends but what they are entitled to is a comprehensive statement of the whole thing <e> <s> i cannot understand why there should be any objection to this small duty being given to the local authority <e> <s> i am entirely unconvinced but life is very short and i do not think it is worth dividing on it because curiously enough i think if we did we should lose <e>", "<cs> i expect at least to be listened to in this house <e> <s> i wanted rather more than that <e> <s> i would hope that what the noble lord has said is really a promise to include something of this kind in the regulations when they are issued <e> <s> on the assumption that that is what the noble lord is promising i shall not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the two things go very well together <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that that was a more satisfactory answer than i usually get to my questions <e> <s> i thank the minister very much and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i have a very satisfactory answer for which i am extremely grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> after those two very moving and entirely convincing speeches from the noble baronesses any other speech would he quite unnecessary <e> <s> let me say merely that i was not wholly convinced by the reason of the noble baroness lady faithfull for leaving out nursery schools but we accepted that <e> <s> i can think of no reason for the other omissions and we on this side will be in full support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord at least agree that clause is as applicable to one as to the other on the question of information <e> <s> i do not see why information should be denied even if there may be a case which i do not for a moment accept on the other two clauses <e>", "<cs> there is only one kind of assisted places scheme i can imagine supporting and that is for choirs <e>", "<cs> we are in a state of total confusion <e>", "<cs> i think that we must take the first group of amendments which was given to us <e> <s> the noble lords amendment must come afterwards <e>", "<cs> inflation was much less then <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply which was the kind of reply that i feared i might get may i ask him whether he is aware that the bbc have made and still make the biggest contribution to music and indirectly to musicians of any broadcasting organisation in the world <e> <s> is he also aware that they made their needs clearly known which were to have not less than for their licence and they only got which is a per cent <e> <s> reduction on what they wanted and this has left them in a difficult position <e>", "<cs> we will have one later my lords <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that advice we are never too proud to take it <e> <s> we have the opportunity of making alterations of this kind on report <e> <s> i only want to say this <e> <s> i was not in any sense in charge of education but i had a position within the department and several times i had to answer in this house on this question <e> <s> the answer was always the same we believe strongly as the noble baroness lady seear has said that nursery education should be available much more widely than it is <e> <s> we were aware that with the pressures we were putting on local authorities to spend less money it was difficult to push them any further but we were happy that the mandatory obligation should remain there and we stood by that always <e>", "<cs> i accept the suggestion with total scepticism <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify this <e> <s> my recollection although as i say i was not in charge of these things is that these figures were allowed to go down because they were not being used by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> if you do what is done here which is to single out educational records and give the secretary of state special rights to deal with them the indication inevitably is that he does not have those rights in relation to anything else <e> <s> i seldom dare to differ from the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill who has been in this business for a great many years and knows more than most people about it but i think that he is wrong here <e> <s> the fact that some loophole has not been abused is not a reason for not closing it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord ought to consider this again to see whether there is not a real point here <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might make one comment as i was in some sense in this house responsible for the act <e> <s> there is not the same necessity for this power for the secretary of state under a tory government as under a labour government <e> <s> when we had certain councils which were deliberately trying to twist conditions in order to reduce the comprehensive and increase the fee-paying side there was a very strong case for it <e>", "<cs> i do not think we shall speak from this bench with any sort of united voice <e> <s> there is no party policy about this <e> <s> i personally have to say that i am <e>"]
