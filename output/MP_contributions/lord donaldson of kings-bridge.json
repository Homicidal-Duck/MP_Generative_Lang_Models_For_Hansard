["<cs> my lords i paused because i wondered whether my noble friend lord longford who has arrived wished to speak <e> <s> i suppose that this will be the first penal debate ever in which he has not spoken <e> <s> i personally regret that <e> <s> it is years since i first heard a debate in your lordships house which is years before i was honoured by joining it <e> <s> in that debate i heard the noble lord lord soper to be revered even if not technically reverend make a splendid speech by which i was very much impressed <e> <s> i thought that he was mostly right then and i think that he is mostly right today <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for opening this debate so lucidly <e> <s> it is a debate which is deliberately designed on a fairly narrow basis because this evening we are not concerned with the battle against crime as a whole or even with the perplexities of after-care we are concerned with the central sanction which is prison <e>", "<cs> my lords i am upset if they are being difficult about anything because it is an important point <e> <s> i wish to say in all humility to the noble lord that my information which may not be right is that there is a sort of departmental tangle here over the detoxification centres of which the weiler report recommended a nationwide series and of which two were built and one is now being closed <e> <s> i gather that it is impossible between the dhss and the home office to get proper agreement <e> <s> i understand that a certain amount of money has been put aside for the secure mental homes suggested by the noble lord lord butler and that this has been not so applied <e>", "<cs> i did say that was a very controversial suggestion my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i stress the point that i hear again and again from magistrates and judges that they would use non-custodial facilities if they had them <e> <s> i believe this to be true and it is certainly true that there are not nearly enough such facilities for them all to be able to use if they so began <e>", "<cs> my lords to be quite clear may i ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> this amounts to a rejection of the weiler report recommendations i take it in <e> <s> this is the first time we have heard this <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all like to hear the noble viscounts question <e> <s> perhaps he would like to ask it of me later on and i will pass it on to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am in rather a difficult position today because i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount said we had failed to bring the non-fee paying schools up to the level of the fee-paying schools but that is a wide generalisation <e> <s> it is certainly true in some cases but it is certainly not true in others <e> <s> i have two grandchildren at a fee-paying school and two grandchildren at a comprehensive school <e> <s> i also have some grandchildren whose parents cannot decide which to do because they do not <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has not had what might be called over-whelming support for her bill <e> <s> i suppose the last speaker who declared himself to be in favour of comprehensive schools in general came about as near as any speaker has been <e> <s> we know that the noble viscount has always been in favour of comprehensive schools and of making them better and a severe but interesting critic of them <e>", "<cs> my lords as a new scheme <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with what <e>", "<cs> if i may dot an occasional i the truth is that the party opposite has two minds over this bill and over the whole question <e> <s> as we heard in speeches on second reading a number of tory supporters are almost as keen on comprehensive education as we are and a certain number are very bitterly against it <e> <s> we are not satisfied to leave this to the goodwill of a government which may develop in what we consider the wrong direction we want it down in black and white and we must insist on it <e>", "<cs> i am in full agreement with my noble friend <e> <s> i think we had eight labour two cross-bench and one liberal <e>", "<cs> in order to help the noble lord may i say that the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has expressed the difference between us so clearly that i think we should now vote <e>", "<cs> may i bring this second reading debate to an end <e> <s> in my opinion it is quite wrong that we should have these very long speeches of a second reading kind at this stage <e> <s> we all expressed ourselves very clearly two days ago <e> <s> may i say again that what we object to is the danger that this bill will reintroduce the -plus examination selection by -plus which we think is very bad indeed <e> <s> that is why we are voting against it <e> <s> none of us has any more to say <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young has given some reasons for questioning the exact form of the amendment but surely what it is trying to do is absolutely fundamental in a situation as difficult as the one with which the bill presents us <e> <s> we shall have a case where a local authority has had first of all the gentlest but admittedly some compulsion to put in a scheme for reorganisation <e> <s> that will then have been rescinded by this bill and one can imagine the kind of passions irritations and excitements which will go on in an area of that kind between the two sides and which this will accentuate <e> <s> what we are concerned with is that the one side which is winning the battle at the moment which is not to go comprehensive but is to go back on the modest compulsion which was being imposed on them should give unequal and irrational resources to the type of school it prefers against the type of school it does not prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that if some change of this kind could be made noble lords here could have an entertainment allowance for without that i do not think they would be able to entertain the press very much <e>", "<cs> my lords could i say two sentences in support of my noble friends new clause <e> <s> the first part of it is a vivid illustration of what was beginning to get better under the comprehensive system as it grew the need for transfers diminishing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is discussed in chapter is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> lord montagu of beaulieu welcomed me in this debate and said that he hoped that i would tell him what my govern <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble baroness in a number of things that she has said <e> <s> i am particularly interested in epilepsy and crime <e> <s> i think we do have a number of successes through education and i entirely agree with her about the dedication of many people within the prison officer service <e> <s> but if i am going to get through the three points that i particularly want to make in reasonable time i do not think i can follow the noble baroness on those matters <e> <s> i begin by saying that sir john may said that he hoped that the report would stimulate the kind of public debate that we think desirable <e> <s> closed institutions above all require open well-informed discussion <e> <s> i had the honour to chair just such a discussion last friday <e> <s> it was organised by nacro <e> <s> of which i am proud to be president and sir john may mr dennis trevelyan head of the prison department and dr roy king from university college north wales were the speakers <e> <s> mr trevelyan praised the report while <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the house in my opinion at any rate would prefer to find these categories described as english-speaking and french-speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by joining my sympathies with those of other noble lords for the appalling tragedy which the noble lord lord ballantrae has suffered <e> <s> if the middle of his speech was as good as the beginning and the end we have missed something very good <e> <s> we miss him here and we send him our sympathy from the bottom of our hearts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene just to make the position clear <e> <s> this has been said by several noble lords and it is a very important point <e> <s> my understanding is that the right reverend prelate has just described the present situation exactly <e> <s> that is the situation today <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is the case but so long as there cannot be a prosecution the situation is the same <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by putting at ease the worry of my noble friend lord longford which is that though i speak from the front bench i speak without consultation with any member of my party and i do not give an official view <e> <s> i am surprised that in a non-political debate the noble earl ever thought such a thing was possible but anyway that is not what i am doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble earl agrees that mill would be on my side over pornography and not wishing to upset <e>", "<cs> my lords in the days of the spanish inquisition for example the state punished people who admitted not believing in god <e> <s> no one outside iran would think that right today <e> <s> times change and so does society <e> <s> in south africa there is legislation against mixed marriages which racists think are bad in themselves and they allege harm to the racial purity of the nation <e> <s> this is really agreeing with the reports adoption of the harm theory but differing over what is harm <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with the first sentence but i would agree with the second <e> <s> of course we want to get rid of pornography <e> <s> what i would not agree is that there is very much evidence that it corrupts the family it may but in any case i am for getting rid of it which is what matters <e> <s> the third point about the written word is that it is historically and has always been the way of spreading ideas <e> <s> clearly if somebody is writing something which is pure filth there are no ideas in it <e> <s> but how do you distinguish <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham said that the weakness of all this was that it destroyed institutions and among other things the institution of marriage <e> <s> does this mean that bertrand russells articles would have been suppressed <e> <s> what else can it mean <e> <s> i am not at all with this point of view <e> <s> i must not keep your lordships too long but i have one further point which i simply must make <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says that everybody will see it but today everybody can see it <e> <s> you can buy it anywhere without the slightest difficulty <e> <s> i have never seen it and i do not suppose that the noble baroness has ever seen it because it is not what we want <e> <s> but people who want it have always been able <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene to defend my colleague <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder said something which is not what we have just heard my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey say <e> <s> surely it is important to stick exactly to what he said <e> <s> my noble and learned friend on the front bench said that he supported this from conviction and was supported in his conviction by the fact that a distinguished committee agreed <e> <s> i am no expert on this matter but the noble lord lord wigoder has entirely misrepresented what my noble and learned friend said <e>", "<cs> this is the only occasion on which i shall open my mouth on this bill but as i have every intention at some stage in the next few months of suggesting in your lordships house that a similar rule be brought in for my own country of england <e> <s> i thought it might be wise to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us are disturbed chiefly by the fact that the best individual adviser available is actually mentioned by name in the papers as having given perfectly clear advice that this hall should be given a grade listing <e> <s> we are very surprised and greatly distressed that the minister should overrule anyone whom we all trust as much as mr lloyd warburton <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because the secretary of state has not taken the advice that we are objecting <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that medical opinion changes month by month <e>", "<cs> i want to urge the government whenever they are asked to do anything sensible not to say that they cannot do it <e> <s> this is what one is always advised when in government <e> <s> one is always told from the draftsmans point of view that one must not say anything in case it implies the opposite somewhere else <e> <s> everybody knows that this is complete nonsense <e> <s> just as over the industry matter which i hope the noble lord will bring up again at report this is an entirely new aspect one which has never before been in an education bill <e> <s> it is sensible to bring to the attention of governing bodies and local authorities <e> <s> it makes complete sense <e> <s> i hope that the government will resist the advice which i am absolutely sure they are being given that by putting this amendment in they may create difficulties concerning somebody else later on <e> <s> i believe this to be foolish untrue and unworthy of them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment he ought to take some notice of the feelings on this side of the committee <e> <s> i thought that the argument put forward by the noble baroness was extremely ingenious but not in fact correct <e> <s> if you have parents of disabled children two of them among your governors they may or may not be suitable to give other people advice on how to deal with other children <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason to suppose that they will be suitable <e> <s> if they are suitable this is a permissive not a mandatory amendment there is no need to do more than pay attention <e> <s> but the idea that any two parents of disabled children are able to give the kind of advice and the kind of practical help that is required in special schools seems to me to be purely wrong <e> <s> as the noble baroness is saying in essence that she agrees with us that it is already doing it i think it would be comforting to us if she would look at this again <e> <s> i do not believe she is already doing it <e>", "<cs> an ingenious mind anyway <e>", "<cs> before this matter is decided i wish to express great discomfort about the present situation <e> <s> we on this side are being pushed into a position where it is suggested that we are against parents having choice <e> <s> that is not only nonsense but everyone who says it knows jolly well that it is nonsense <e> <s> it should not be said <e> <s> it was said to me again and again during the debate on our education bill and i lost my temper every single time <e> <s> it is an absolutely intolerable and dishonest argument <e>", "<cs> i must add one word to the extraordinarily clear explanation just given to the committee of exactly what the argument is about because this concerns the entire bill <e> <s> there are a number of other things in the bill which we do not like but this is the centre of what we do not like <e> <s> we had this argument when i was in the noble ladys position for what seemed like months two or three years ago and i do not think a single member of the opposition side ever spoke up in favour of the -plus <e> <s> i know that some noble lords were not here and might have done so had they been here <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter might have spoken in favour of it if he had been here but he was not <e> <s> in the course of those three or four months i do not believe i ever had to attack the -plus as put forward by somebody from the other side <e> <s> one always found them saying i am not going to defend the -plus but i just wanted to add that to what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> i was expecting the minister to give us the answer which i thought i had got <e> <s> i was so sure that he would give it that i did not bother to make reference to the fact that this point is covered by an earlier finance act <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble minister has that but i think it was but i cannot remember what section <e> <s> i was advised that this was covered by that act and therefore this is unnecessary <e> <s> if that is not the case i think his answer is not entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke on this in committee and i want to speak on it again <e> <s> my belief is that the correct and best course that the national heritage act and fund can pursue is summed up in clause <e> <s> i wish to see the trustees looking after all affairs to do with both real property and chattels in lieu and otherwisebut i do not think it is desirable to push this through against the fairly strong opposition of half the customers that is the museums <e> <s> therefore i have a certain sympathy with the minister for the arts who wrote this letter and i have to confess that i think it was a mild indiscretion to put it on paper <e> <s> i have sympathy with him and if i were in his position i do not think i should want to force this through if one of the beneficiaries was strongly against it <e> <s> this blocks the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what possible reason there could be for moving amendments on third reading when they have not been moved tonight <e> <s> what is the object <e> <s> why were they not moved tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the prime minister and her majesty the queen will not appoint somebody who is so rich and so retired that he does not think before he acts which is what it seemed to me the noble lord was saying we could expect from the chairman <e> <s> i think i must have misunderstood him but that is what he seemed to me to say <e> <s> at the end of our deliberations it would be a pity to divide again as the cohorts which always lurk behind the front bench are all having supper and i cannot see any point in putting to a vote something which we are bound to lose by an enormous amount <e> <s> so i shall advise my noble friend that i do not think it is worth pursuing though i think that the government will be quite wrong as is often the case <e>", "<cs> i am a little unhappy about this <e> <s> i am not asking that any power should be taken away from anybodyi am asking that a duty should be put <e>", "<cs> the two speakers from the liberal benches have clarified my approach very well <e> <s> what i want is for it to be the responsibility of the local authority to tell the people living in their area what is available in the way of education in that area <e> <s> i do not of course mean that they have to prepare it themselves <e> <s> they will get it from the governors as the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord ought to look at this again <e> <s> i am not going to divide the committee because i do not think it is of sufficient importance because it is halfway there <e> <s> but the noble lord is leaving the ordinary parent in a particular local authority where no agreement has been made to search out in different pages in different educational journals to find out what is available <e> <s> doubtless they can ask their friends but what they are entitled to is a comprehensive statement of the whole thing <e> <s> i cannot understand why there should be any objection to this small duty being given to the local authority <e> <s> i am entirely unconvinced but life is very short and i do not think it is worth dividing on it because curiously enough i think if we did we should lose <e>", "<cs> i expect at least to be listened to in this house <e> <s> i wanted rather more than that <e> <s> i would hope that what the noble lord has said is really a promise to include something of this kind in the regulations when they are issued <e> <s> on the assumption that that is what the noble lord is promising i shall not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the two things go very well together <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that that was a more satisfactory answer than i usually get to my questions <e> <s> i thank the minister very much and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i have a very satisfactory answer for which i am extremely grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> after those two very moving and entirely convincing speeches from the noble baronesses any other speech would he quite unnecessary <e> <s> let me say merely that i was not wholly convinced by the reason of the noble baroness lady faithfull for leaving out nursery schools but we accepted that <e> <s> i can think of no reason for the other omissions and we on this side will be in full support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord at least agree that clause is as applicable to one as to the other on the question of information <e> <s> i do not see why information should be denied even if there may be a case which i do not for a moment accept on the other two clauses <e>", "<cs> there is only one kind of assisted places scheme i can imagine supporting and that is for choirs <e>", "<cs> we are in a state of total confusion <e>", "<cs> i think that we must take the first group of amendments which was given to us <e> <s> the noble lords amendment must come afterwards <e>", "<cs> inflation was much less then <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply which was the kind of reply that i feared i might get may i ask him whether he is aware that the bbc have made and still make the biggest contribution to music and indirectly to musicians of any broadcasting organisation in the world <e> <s> is he also aware that they made their needs clearly known which were to have not less than for their licence and they only got which is a per cent <e> <s> reduction on what they wanted and this has left them in a difficult position <e>", "<cs> we will have one later my lords <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that advice we are never too proud to take it <e> <s> we have the opportunity of making alterations of this kind on report <e> <s> i only want to say this <e> <s> i was not in any sense in charge of education but i had a position within the department and several times i had to answer in this house on this question <e> <s> the answer was always the same we believe strongly as the noble baroness lady seear has said that nursery education should be available much more widely than it is <e> <s> we were aware that with the pressures we were putting on local authorities to spend less money it was difficult to push them any further but we were happy that the mandatory obligation should remain there and we stood by that always <e>", "<cs> i accept the suggestion with total scepticism <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify this <e> <s> my recollection although as i say i was not in charge of these things is that these figures were allowed to go down because they were not being used by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> if you do what is done here which is to single out educational records and give the secretary of state special rights to deal with them the indication inevitably is that he does not have those rights in relation to anything else <e> <s> i seldom dare to differ from the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill who has been in this business for a great many years and knows more than most people about it but i think that he is wrong here <e> <s> the fact that some loophole has not been abused is not a reason for not closing it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord ought to consider this again to see whether there is not a real point here <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might make one comment as i was in some sense in this house responsible for the act <e> <s> there is not the same necessity for this power for the secretary of state under a tory government as under a labour government <e> <s> when we had certain councils which were deliberately trying to twist conditions in order to reduce the comprehensive and increase the fee-paying side there was a very strong case for it <e>", "<cs> i do not think we shall speak from this bench with any sort of united voice <e> <s> there is no party policy about this <e> <s> i personally have to say that i am <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may follow the noble lord lord reigate we on this side are content with the appointment arrangements but we are thoroughly upset by the assurance which was given to a most specific question by my noble friend lady birk who said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the subject of sugar may i ask him for one clarification <e> <s> he spoke of exports from the community to the outside world and deplored the practice and i entirely agree <e> <s> but to what extent are those exports produced in this country and to what extent in the community apart from this country <e> <s> does he know the answer <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has just said my noble friend put his case superbly <e> <s> i am not going to attempt to

noble baroness is saying <e> <s> this can only be based on the belief that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have a very strong objection to this having been read in relation to a forceful speech but i do not think anyone could say that it was offensive in any way <e> <s> i wish to reject the suggestion absolutely on behalf of everybody on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that the debate be resumed <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord nugent of guildford and lord drumalbyn have justified something which of course they do not want to do i give them credit for that on grounds which are totally unacceptable <e> <s> it is not acceptable to reduce the emoluments to the poorest on the basis of an intellectual gamble it is

are intellectually equipped to decide this question per cent <e> <s> may agree with me and per cent <e> <s> may agree with the noble lord maybe <e> <s> to make this kind of petty saving at the expense of the poorest in the community is an action based purely on a belief not held by a majority of people that the governments plans will work <e> <s> we all know this and we say that it is absolutely unjustifiable to attack certain things even though one considers that economies must be made <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness forgive me for interrupting her <e> <s> did she quote a figure of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that to be perfectly frank my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington made a devastating speech and not a word that has been said since has relieved my mind in any way as regards the attack he made <e> <s> i think that this nation has to decide whether we are prepared to let this situation go on more or less exactly as it is because what is being suggested at this moment will not have any very great effect on it or whether we are prepared to pay the price of improving it which is to accept some diminution in security in the treatment of petty offenders <e> <s> i must say at the beginning that i have every sympathy for the metropolitan commissioner <e> <s> his job is to catch criminals and shut them up but our job is to deal with them when they come out again <e> <s> most of these petty criminals have short sentences and really might just as well be let out after days <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be interested to know not necessarily now but perhaps in a letter how often that transfer is demanded <e> <s> it seems to me that if there is the power this could take place quite often <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i prepared some remarks on the basis of yesterdays speakers list which consisted only of the noble viscount lord gormanston but we have had such an informed series of additions to that list that the greater part of my preparation would be repetition <e> <s> so i can skate a little faster over my notes than i should otherwise have to do <e> <s> in particular i am very glad that the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead pointed out the needs of the national film school which is disgracefully little supported by television and which is truly <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness finally sits down

a ceiling but that even if there were you would have to pay up to that ceiling is that the problem <e> <s> in other words the doctors wife is not to be paid at all on any basis <e> <s> i understood the noble baroness to say that they could not do this because there was no ceiling whereas with mps wives there is a ceiling quite properly in my view <e> <s> this seems not to be the case <e> <s> would the noble baroness kindly explain it again <e> <s> because i do not understand it on what has been said <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go on too much about this but the noble baroness seems to be saying that the whole argument about a ceiling is entirely irrelevant <e> <s> the government are not prepared to pay it ceiling or no ceiling <e> <s> i think it was misleading i know not whether deliberately or not deliberately that that should have been brought in as an argument <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave us a handsome apology for meeting today <e> <s> i shall make no complaint but i must myself regrettably make a very humble apology <e> <s> when an important debate of this kind is put on suddenly on a day which is normally a free day it does tend to conflict with unavoidable engagements and i regret to say that i am going to do something i have not done for six years in this house which is to leave before the end of a debate in which i have spoken <e> <s> i must humbly ask the pardon of the house <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords i have read it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point i do not wish to go down in history in the unread

of money to preserve our heritage <e> <s> here is one of the most important parts of our heritage according to the people responsible for it being in serious danger of going wrong before the remedy

plausible and attractive as the noble lord who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just clear my mind on this <e> <s> the subsidised theatre behaves in exactly the same way as the unsubsidised is that not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord beaumont suggested that that was not so <e> <s> in my opinion it used not to be so but it is now <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the noble lord has confused one or two different things that i said <e> <s> i said that the iba was directly responsible for the standards of the fourth channel and therefore was the wrong body to say whether those were being maintained successfully <e> <s> i also said that the bbc and the iba authorities were not the right people to look at the future because they would be too busy trying to keep up with it <e>", "<cs> i did not expect to have a great victory with this amendment and i am not at all surprised at what has been said <e> <s> it was basically an attempt to put before the committee two problems towards which nothing that anybody has said today has gone any way to solve <e> <s> this amendment although it may be subject to a number of problems would have a solution to those two things both very important <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy with the noble lords reply <e> <s> i must confess that i was rather shaken by the comments of the noble lord lord winstanley

amendment of my noble friend lord hatch is not accepted <e> <s> of course if it were accepted it would cover this matter <e> <s> therefore i beg to leave withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the intense

which i withdrew because i thought that it was possibly in the wrong place but as my first amendment has not been accepted i shall wish to consult with the open university as to whether we ought not to have an amendment suggesting some <e>", "<cs> i should like to say in reply to the points made by the noble lord that i think that one amendment that might be suitable would be to demand that the reports of the iba and indeed of the bbc are debated annually in parliament <e> <s> that might possibly cover my point <e>", "<cs> as a member of the board <e>", "<cs> i think that he is what we call an observer is he not <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it has been a helpful discussion and i know more than i did as he has modestly said he does <e> <s> i should like to put on record that on the face of it i think the fourth channel should have a position on the board <e> <s> i should like that simply to be in the record of our discussion <e> <s> i do not press it any further than that <e> <s> i should like to see the noble baroness lady trumpington on it if her breakfast comes off <e> <s> if itn is going to provide news for other than the channels it does at the moment those other channels should be represented but i put this idea forward simply for discussion and i hope that the people who are concerned with this will take notice of what we have said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i mean <e> <s> the subsidiary company is the body chiefly responsible for programming the fourth channel <e> <s> it is therefore responsible for what news the fourth channel puts forth <e> <s> it may have ideas about what it wants and i think that it ought to have more than a purely commercial relationship with the body which produces the news <e> <s> in other words i think there should be a representative of the fourth channel subsidiary on the board <e>", "<cs> it is a rare privilege for me to be able to support this government but i am able to do so tonight <e> <s> it has also been a great pleasure to us on this side of the committee to hear the kind of normal boardroom capitalist argument going on between two groups of people who are all making a great deal of money out of television <e> <s> i have no objection to that at all <e> <s> we stand absolutely on what is in the bill which is that the fourth channel in order to keep its independence should be given a fixed sum which is not dependent on advertisers on contractors or on anybody else <e> <s> i think the noble lord has replied extremely well in a difficult situation with all his noble friends against him and i am very happy to support him <e>", "<cs> i can only say that is too bad <e>", "<cs> may i ask a very brief question about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one of the things in which we are very interested is where the money is to come from <e> <s> i do not entirely understand amendment no <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this but does it mean that if more money were wanted than they agreed it would come off the levy and therefore in a sense from the government <e> <s> that is where i want to see it come from <e>", "<cs> it is true that it says not less than three <e> <s> i should like to have not less than five but perhaps we may discuss it further <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this in general but if we increase the number of people it would not be necessary to specify who they were which is probably the better way <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> i think that his argument was incontrovertible <e> <s> it follows upon my amendment which i withdrew and upon the amendment of the noble lord lord winstanley which was also withdrawn <e> <s> i hope that now that we have had three amendments all vaguely concerned with the same subject the government may for the first time in a long sitting find themselves able to say that they do not totally disagree with every single thing that any of us say <e>", "<cs> this is something which happens every day <e> <s> if somebody has an interest and is on a committee he does not sit when his interest is being discussed <e> <s> there is no problem of any kind here <e>", "<cs> very badly <e>", "<cs> there is an amendment put down by the noble lord lord hooson no <e> <s> <e> <s> before we come to that which i do not think we shall tonight i should like to say that my belief is that the existing complaints procedures should be maintained that the person who wishes to make a complaint against the bbc or one of the companies should always be able to apply first to them and only if he gets no satisfaction should the much more elaborate statutory procedure be introduced <e> <s> i do not know whether any pronouncement has been made upon this <e> <s> i do not think it is clear whether or not the bbc or the other companies are keeping their existing procedures <e> <s> i do not need to have an answer now but we shall want to know before we get to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl allow me to intervene very briefly <e> <s> this is not the case <e> <s> there is a complaints procedure one can complain to the bbc about things one does not like <e>", "<cs> i have not tried it but perhaps the noble earl has <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say from this side of the house that we think it is quite possible that if members will confine themselves to the amendments and not make long second reading speeches we can get through in time for us to have our dinner in a reasonable place at a reasonable hour <e>", "<cs> in our last discussion i asked the noble lord whether in fact the existing complaints commissions were to be maintained <e> <s> i warned him that this amendment was coming up and that an answer would be required by then no doubt we shall have it from him <e> <s> i wish in one sentence to say that i agree with every word that the noble lord lord hooson said and fully support the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes but if the noble lord accepts lord hoosons amendment they will not be able to disband them <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said that he will not press this amendment may i press the noble lord who is to reply to look at this matter carefully <e> <s> it would be possible to improve it by altering the time scale <e> <s> the days period seems something which could be easily altered <e> <s> i believe this to be very important and i hope the noble lord will look at it and come back <e>", "<cs> i am very worried about this <e> <s> it is a difficult problem <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord who moved the amendment to withdraw it and to bring it back on report after further discussion <e> <s> my approach is absolutely one-sided <e> <s> i am for protecting the programme-maker against unnecessary vulgar and offensive complaints <e> <s> if what i am suggesting is going to have the opposite effect i shall not push it but i have not been convinced <e> <s> the noble lord lord hill of luton convinced me still more that anything of this kind which as an absolute rule was held in public would be more damaging to the programme-makers than the other way <e> <s> if that is not the case i certainly do not want to support the government <e> <s> i find it very difficult however to make up my mind on what we have heard <e> <s> i should like to talk to a lot of friends who are in television and ask them what they think <e> <s> my noble friend lord bernstein said that the newspapers would take it up <e> <s> they would take up some of it but i should have thought that they would take up less if the hearing were in private with the parties being allowed to make a report than if it were in public <e> <s> this is the whole point at issue and i do not think that we ought to decide it until we have got clearer views <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will consider doing that <e>", "<cs> i too found the noble lords arguments dangerously persuasive and <e>", "<cs> i do not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my face should be red if it is my mistake <e> <s> i do not have the main act with me it is in my office but i will look at it and try to explain <e> <s> i do not think that alters the obvious intention of the amendment which is that if the iba or a contracting company bids against the bbc in order to do the same <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and other noble lords who have spoken on this subject <e> <s> i said in my opening remarks that it dealt with one side of the problem only and therefore might not be satisfactory and i certainly have no intention of pressing it <e> <s> i wanted above all to show that there was in the intervention of the noble lord lord wigg a real point which had not been met by the negotiations of the iba and bbc <e> <s> i shall not judge between them <e> <s> my noble friend lord aylestone makes the strong suggestion that the iba door is wide open for discussion of this kind <e> <s> i hope the bbc will note that if anybody there reads the <e>", "<cs> i am not going to press the amendment but there are one or two failures of argument which i think should be pointed out <e> <s> in the first place it is certainly desirable in presenting anything to children that they should have breaks but those breaks do not have to be advertising breaks so that argument seems to me to be of no interest whatever <e> <s> secondly my noble friend behind me lord strabolgi said that it is frightfully important that children should learn to resist advertising by seeing it occasionally and at the same time he said that there was no point in my amendment because they would see it at other times so that seemed to contradict itself <e>", "<cs> the argument remains exactly the same <e> <s> i am not going to press this amendment <e> <s> i did not refer to the fact that the previous government my government had decided not to do this <e> <s> i did of course know it and decided to raise the matter again in spite of it with nobody objecting because i think it needed to be discussed further <e> <s> but having said that <e>", "<cs> my lords we all want to hear the minister so i will not detain the house <e> <s> as a heterosexual who lives in england i find it difficult to vote on this issue though if i lived in scotland i should not have the slightest hesitation in opposing the noble earls amendment and supporting my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey <e> <s> are english peers going to vote on this or not <e> <s> if they are i shall stay and vote but i <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord fortescue addressed himself to an entirely hypothetical situation <e> <s> many of the people who agree with me about the necessity for penal reform have been pressing for many years for something to be done about fines <e> <s> we have never said there should be complete removal for deliberate refusal to pay money where the money exists in the pocket and that is the essential issue <e> <s> however it is quite irrelevant to this bill and i do not think we should discuss it <e> <s> i shall try to keep to a few points in relation to the bill and the discussion we have had because the noble and learned lord chancellor is right to say that the details we can discuss in the next hour or two and that we need not discuss those now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am waiting anxiously to know what the minister is going to say <e> <s> i find myself in the unprecedented position of almost agreeing with the noble earl lord de la warr <e> <s> i think it is most unlikely that we can support these amendments <e> <s> i shall not say more than that we have the new advisory committee under my noble friend lord thomson and this surely must go most of the way to deal with the kind of problem that the noble lord lord drumalbyn has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hatch of lusby has found support in all parts of the chamber and he will be pleased and i hope not surprised to find that he is receiving support from his front bench <e> <s> we have had some distinguished opposition small but heavyweight and i should like to begin by saying that the noble lord lord home of the hirsel was a little unfair <e> <s> we all know that my noble friend lord hatch is a third world enthusiast <e> <s> the amendment does not use any term other than international and it is quite wrong to suggest that because my noble friend lord hatch has certain enthusiasms the amendment will carry them <e> <s> it will not <e> <s> international is a perfectly simple word which means international it has nothing whatever to do with one interpretation of international as against another <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not customary to ask questions of speakers other than the government spokesman but i find it irresistible to say that i have not the slightest idea <e> <s> a very large number of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to interrupt him for only one minute <e> <s> he quoted a number of sorts of education remedial <e>", "<cs> my lords uncharacteristically the noble lord has been pretty disagreeable about this <e> <s> he put extraordinary weight on the fact that through my carelessness we said committee instead of council <e> <s> i expect a better answer than that from the noble lord <e> <s> i was really shocked at his referring to it twice and somewhat irritated <e> <s> the second thing which i thought verging on the offensive was the suggestion that i and my colleagues were trying to do something for the open university behind the back of the bill <e> <s> this is an absolutely unjustified suggestion and i am absolutely astonished that the noble lord should make it <e> <s> we have worked together for many years and he has never accused me before of going behind anybodys back i hope he never will again <e> <s> i should like to put on record that i think he should not have said it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord annan is in semantic trouble <e> <s> i could surely say without saying anything wrong that sir hugh greene has enormous experience of broadcasting i do not have to say that he has had <e> <s> both are true <e> <s> experience is something you have had it is in the past <e> <s> it is purely a semantic point and it should not stop the noble lord supporting this amendment which i think is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i have prepared a long and closely reasoned speech but i am far too hungry to make it <e> <s> i think this debate has been extremely ill-handled <e> <s> it is ridiculous because i think a lot of people still want to speak but i suggest that if i forgo my right perhaps the noble lord will forgo a great deal of his speech and we can deal with this fairly quickly <e> <s> the answer is that the division between us is perfectly clear <e> <s> i thought the speech made by my noble friend lord hill was brilliant dead on the point and exactly what i think <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury an old schoolfriend of mine thinks the exact opposite <e> <s> that is roughly our position and there is not much more to be said <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt i agree with the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> he tabled this amendment and so did the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> i suggested to the noble lord lord hooson that he should put his name to the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> i think that it would be more satisfactory if we could discuss the problem as a whole and then move the amendments separately and decide whether to divide on them as they come up <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the nice things about this house is that argument here unlike argument in certain other places is listened to carefully and can provide grounds for changing ones mind <e> <s> the arguments that we had in committee and the many discussions outside the chamber with people concerned with the artistic side of the business plus one or two new thoughts of my own have convinced me that i should change my mind and support the exclusion of this subsection so that there will be no special reference in the bill to complaints about the unfair treatment of the dead <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord what we are certain about is that the subsection is wrong which is a different point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every word that the noble lord has said and i shall not add to them <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i have the right of reply so i shall have to say something to my noble friend before we finish <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord has read this amendment he was looking at the last one <e> <s> the terms of the amendment are to include some comment <e> <s> this does not involve a pen <e> <s> there is only one advisory council to the iba which is concerned with education <e> <s> there are some committees and presumably it subsumes them if that is the right word so i do not think the argument about other advisory councils has anything to do with it <e> <s> the point of my amendment and of our feelings on this side of the house is extremely well illustrated by my noble friends difficulty in knowing what it is all about <e> <s> i will now define education in my terms <e> <s> an educational statement is something which either does or is intended to leave the hearer knowing more after than before the statement was made <e> <s> this seems to me what education really means nowadays and it is too wide to leave in a bill like this without some check <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of our rather long discussions i should like to say one or two things <e> <s> first by trying to tighten up the bill one has inevitably given the impression that some of us here are critical of the iba <e> <s> in fact i think that this is a false impression <e> <s> if one is trying to insert safeguards for the future it is inevitable that one can sound rather offensive towards the body in regard to which one is proposing the safeguards <e> <s> i hope that we shall not be misunderstood on this <e>", "<cs> not with this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that that was so long ago but it was a very important concession for which we are grateful <e>"]
