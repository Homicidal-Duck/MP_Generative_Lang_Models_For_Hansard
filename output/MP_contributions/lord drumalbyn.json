<e> <s> i am not saying that we are settling on whatever is the lower of the two when we choose prices alone and that is certainly not likely to be the case <e> <s> it may be the case in one year but

of course local supplementary benefits officers hitherto have had much more discretion <e> <s> apparently it is intended <e>", "<cs> what puzzles me a little about what my noble friend has said and i am most grateful to her for the full answer which she has given to me is her remark that consideration was given as to whether the appointment should he statutory or non-statutory <e> <s> as i

annual report of the ministry of social security which covers national insurance <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will consider whether it also might cover supplementary benefit matters as the best way of reporting <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the cbi has requested a meeting with a minister at the department of industry on this matter <e> <s> if so is it intended to accord the cbi an opportunity to discusss this matter with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend for answering so fully the points that have been raised <e> <s> he has done it with his usual care and vigour and he does it at a fairly breakneck speed which is commendable because we have to get home <e> <s> it will repay re-reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend refers to the value of the applicants home does he include with that the furniture blankets and all the rest of it in that home <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps it would be unfortunate if my noble friend were to get the impression that we on this side of the house did not equally welcome back our leader but when the headmaster comes in at the door one never knows what is going to happen <e> <s> i should like to say on behalf of my noble friends that we tremendously admire the way in which he transferred from this house to zimbabwe rhodesia as it was then an atmosphere which certainly brought about splendid results <e> <s> his own character his dignity and his determina <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which it is quite clear has received great approbation in this house <e> <s> is he aware that the tradition in this country is a very precious one namely that it is part of the pride and stability of the country that the civil servants serve governments of all complexions without distinction and that they ought not to withdraw their labour on political grounds <e>", "<cs> to correct the record my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he did not make a mistake when he quoted the name of the author of that resounding sentiment <e> <s> i think he meant mr atkinson but i think he said mr macgregor <e>", "<cs> before we come to a conclusion on this may i put to my noble friend that there seems to be very little between the sides on this <e> <s> everybody agrees that it is inevitable essential and sensible that there should be some consultation of some sort before an application is made <e> <s> the question is whether we make it statutory or not <e> <s> if we make it statutory i should have thought that we should express it in rather more detail and i am not certain that the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord why he has put his amendment in this form <e> <s> if he is basing his case on people who might be in part-time employment would it not have been easier for him to have inserted who is not in full-time employment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might comment on this subject from a rather different point of view <e> <s> when one considers the state that some countries are in today and the reasons for it it makes the problems that are presented by this part of the bill comparatively insignificant <e> <s> what we are suffering from now is inflation and anything we can do to bring inflation down is worth doing <e> <s> at present inflation is running at say per cent <e> <s> per annum which means that progressively throughout the year people will be less well off particularly those who are in receipt of national insurance in one form or another <e> <s> supposing inflation reached per cent <e> <s> i will not go so far as to suppose it reaches per cent <e> <s> as it has done in some south american countries just think what would be involved then <e> <s> in the course of one year the recipients of unemployment benefit retirement pension and the rest would have their incomes reduced by three-quarters <e>", "<cs> it is a most unwelcome necessity but it is not a disgrace to do what is necessary <e> <s> we believe this is the sole criterion at the present time and it is for that reason that we support the bill <e>", "<cs> we are talking about the national insurance scheme and social security benefits and in paying out benefits we cannot go above a certain proportion of the national wealth <e> <s> obviously to go above that would be entirely self-defeating <e> <s> again this is a question of judgment at any given time <e> <s> all i am saying is that it must not be accepted that at all times it can be said that in return for a certain contribution one will receive a certain benefit in terms of purchasing power that cannot be so <e> <s> we have been very fortunate over the years in being able to increase the real value of social security benefits <e> <s> there was bound to come a time when there would be a change around <e> <s> we hope that it will be for only a short time and it will be for an even shorter time if we take the correct measures now <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has come back to the point of the poverty line <e> <s> can he say where the poverty line <e>", "<cs> the argument that the noble lord has put forward is in some respects a cogent one but it is not a new one <e> <s> we have all been faced those who have had to deal with these things with the problem that some people who are entitled to benefits do not take them up <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend will be able to deal with that point i hope she will <e> <s> but it does not seem to me that that in itself would be a full justification for excluding the requirement to reduce the benefits for these groups the sickness benefit the unemployment benefit and so on by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords does this mean an end in due course to the independent deterrent in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if licences are granted to the three companies that have applied for them will the companies be free to choose their own routes <e> <s> will they be free to negotiate intermediate freedoms with other countries <e>", "<cs> if i understood him aright my noble friend said that supplement would be abolished as from january <e> <s> is that actually in the bill or is it just the intention of the government that that should be so <e> <s> i cannot find it in the bill <e>", "<cs> but is it in the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that it is governed by clause and it is not yet actually in the bill it is an intention <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a small point about the cut-off date <e> <s> if i understood my noble friend aright he said that the earnings-related supplement would end on rd january but that those who already had an entitlement still running would be allowed to continue until a cut-off date which i think he said was towards the end of june <e> <s> it looks as though that is all right for the sickness benefit because that is days and that would be just about running out by that time <e> <s> in other words the benefit and the earnings-related supplement would end at about the same time <e> <s> but when we come to unemployment benefit that runs for days and the cut-off date would cut off the supplement in the middle of the period of benefit <e> <s> i wonder whether he could give consideration to that <e>", "<cs> i am interested to note from the two speeches that have been made that there is no substantial opposition to the principle of this particular clause <e> <s> perhaps it is worth recalling that quite a long time ago about years ago our colleague lord evans of hunger-shall made a report on this matter <e> <s> i remember it very well because at the time i happened to be at the department of national insurance <e> <s> that report has been in cold storage for quite a long time but at last it has come out <e> <s> i cannot say that i remember the details <e> <s> indeed i doubt whether i would find a copy of it in the printed paper office but no doubt it is in the library <e> <s> i do not know whether the figure of was in some way related to the figure of disregard so to speak that the noble lord recommended at that time <e> <s> personally i have always felt inclined to accept the recommendation of that committee difficult as it was to get a majority for it particularly in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> i think the minister said that the numbers were of those who had applied for unemployment benefit <e> <s> perhaps he could verify whether they had actually received unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> may i ask one question <e> <s> there are those with many opinions <e> <s> as has been said one cannot indict a whole nation it may be very difficult to indict a whole trade union <e> <s> there are different opinions <e> <s> the minority cannot control what the majority however misguided may decide <e> <s> would it not suffice to allow payments to be made on the strict understanding that they should be repaid when the people are back at work <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i did not go so far as saying full supplementary benefit <e> <s> i asked that payment would be made in accordance with need <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but my noble friend begged the question by talking about a benefit <e> <s> what is being asked for is a payment in case of need not a regular benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the international red cross withdrew voluntarily from kabul or were they expelled <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that assistance from europe comes from two directions <e> <s> i am not quite clear from what he said whether this is so <e> <s> first there is general assistance towards development in areas suffering from high unemployment and in need of development and secondly from the steel directive which allows for assistance if i remember aright in cases of redundancies and the general run-down of the industry <e> <s> in that case if i remember correctly it is mandatory to report and to get the confirmation i will not say permission but at any rate confirmation of the commission to the proposals that are made <e> <s> is that what he meant by referring to the permission of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be years before he would be able to buy it with a per cent <e> <s> discount <e>", "<cs> seventeen plus three my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that it is the draft directive that the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton is seeking to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the message that my noble friend has <e>", "<cs> whose main task is to keep the industry alive and bring it back to health <e> <s> that is surely the message that my noble friend has given us today and we ought not to anticipate events by demands for massive injections of funds at this time <e> <s> obviously he has to be given whatever is needed to keep the industry alive <e> <s> of course we have friends and allies with us in europe in the european communities <e> <s> the other steel industries are very nearly equally affected throughout europe <e> <s> will my noble friend confirm that the maximum use is being made of the assistance that is available <e> <s> lastly dealing with the point that the noble lord lord rochester raised there is the other aspect of the matter <e> <s> i think that he was referring to those who are already confronted or are about to be confronted by unemployment <e> <s> what he was asking was what arrangements are being made to train these people in advance of industry coming to replace the jobs that they have lost in steel <e>", "<cs> may i point out to the noble lord that this is the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously not desirable that i should remain mute in these circumstances <e> <s> my noble friend was good enough to write to me about this and i can tell the noble lord lord wells-pestell that she said almost the same in her letter as in her reply to him now <e> <s> my noble friend said that this amendment would be quite unacceptable because if i understood her correctly part of the intention is to cause trade unionists to look more to their trade unions in case of a strike <e> <s> immediately the question arises what happens if a person in distress is not a member of a trade union but is on strike because others who are members of trade unions are on strike and he fears the consequences which can be pretty serious if he does not also go on strike <e> <s> i think that is a matter which has to be borne in mind <e> <s> my noble friend says that establishing this new principle as she calls it would give rise to a long-drawn-out process and would cause complications <e> <s> when i spoke about this i had in mind the old principle that applies in general to supplementary benefit that if you are in dire distress there is somewhere you can go <e> <s> i do not think any of us are wholly certain after the no <e> <s> bill where discretion begins and ends but it seems to me that in any situation like this you must have some discretion left to those who are making payments of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask her one question <e> <s> i hope that i know the answer to it <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the families of strikers will be treated as entitled to supplementary benefit with the deduction of the and entitled to all that goes with that <e> <s> in particular i was thinking of the free prescriptions and that kind of thing on the health side <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not go over what i said before because as the noble lord said in introducing this amendment it is intended to cover very much the same ground as we went over before <e> <s> i could not have accepted the width of the amendment for leaving out paragraph <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite follow what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i have pointed out at an earlier stage that there was no cross-examination of the witness during the procedures on the bill before the select committee <e> <s> i have also said that i am not quoting from the report <e> <s> i must examine the arguments put forward by the promoters if i am to make a case that there are answers to the points that were made <e> <s> without that i cannot see how i can possibly contest the standing of clause <e> <s> i hope therefore that <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem i have to face is that the case has been so fully put already <e> <s> noble lords will probably have received a copy of the representations made by the greater manchester council or manchester city and of course they have been discussed in great detail before the select committee <e> <s> i think it is only fair that i should attempt to rebut to the extent that is necessary what has been said <e> <s> i do not see how we can proceed otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that was a matter that came into evidence before the select committee but it is true that there are these powers <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that local authorities do not have to issue tenders to other members of the common market nor indeed wider than that <e> <s> it is only the national government and the agencies of national government that have to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i thought i made it clear that that was not the ground at all on which i was opposing the legislation <e> <s> indeed it is the ground on which the promoters gained support for it in the select committee <e>", "<cs> i did not say that my lords <e> <s> i said that this was the opinion of the opponents of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i hope he <e>", "<cs> my lords i was careful to put in the word without any disrespect to the select committee no expert cross-examination <e> <s> there was counsel on one side alone and the evidence was not subject to cross-examination because there was no other counsel there <e>", "<cs> my lords i need say very little <e> <s> i think it would be wrong for me to withdraw my motion <e> <s> the fact that this is without precedent is <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that with a view to maintaining employment some firms have actually accepted cuts in salaries <e>", "<cs> ruled out <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one or two observations on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock certainly knows a great deal about this subject and his memory goes back just about the same length as mine in dealing with it <e> <s> i admit he knows more about the subject than i do <e> <s> i never had to deal with housing when i was at the scottish office and he had to deal with it for a long time <e> <s> i wonder whether he is really looking at this matter from the right angle <e> <s> the point here is to enable there to be a stock of houses for the whole country of scotland as my noble friend said and one does not take away a house simply because it is sold by a local authority to a sitting tenant <e> <s> one does not take it away it remains as part of the stock and the tenant still goes on occupying it and is likely to do so for some years because he will not want to lose his discount <e> <s> the question is how is one going to finance the housing of those people who still need housing <e> <s> it has nothing to do with whether a particular house is within the stock of the local authority or within the general stock of houses in the area <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how pleased we are to see the noble lord back in his place again <e> <s> we hope he is entirely recovered from his recent illness <e> <s> i wonder whether what the noble lord has said is tenable at all because sooner or later it is just as likely that a house will be let that is one of the houses that are sold as that it will be occupied by the owner himself <e> <s> this surely is the desirable aim to get more houses to let <e> <s> the whole of the scottish scene in housing has been bedevilled <e> <s> it goes right back to the question of owners rates as noble lords will remember and the two sorn reports and the way in which we had to get rid of that and finished up with rents that were so small as to be totally ridiculous <e> <s> some privately owned houses were being let at half-a-crown a week the reason being that in order to get rid of this anomaly it was necessary to reduce the rent payable by the tenant by the amount of rates that he was taking over from the landlord <e> <s> this was a perfectly absurd thing to do but it had to be done at that time <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord will admit that it was mainly the cessation of the building of houses during the first world war that influenced the situation <e>", "<cs> i take a different view from that expressed by my two noble <e>", "<cs> yes that is right <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend can confirm what i say in relation to the point raised by the noble viscount <e> <s> it seems to me that it is intended that a person should be able to qualify in any house of another public housing authority and also of any of these other bodies like the prison service forestry and so on within the public sphere <e> <s> the case that was taken was that of the prison service or the police service <e> <s> let us assume that he starts off in a new house with a new career and that his service in the prisons or the police counts to enable him to buy the house that he has moved into on the basis of renting it practically right away <e> <s> i think that that is right if he has served the three years <e> <s> i see nothing wrong with that <e> <s> one is merely treating the publicly-owned housing service as one complete service for that purpose not for all other purposes <e> <s> it seems perfectly reasonable to me <e>", "<cs> may i say a word about that <e> <s> if i understand the position properly the answer to the point made by the noble lord lord mackie is surely this that values of houses in areas with high unemployment will tend to fall <e> <s> is that not so <e> <s> and these areas of high unemployment are just the areas which want to attract industry <e> <s> what happens very often is that industry will not go to a particular area because there is a deficiency in that area of certain classes of skilled labour <e> <s> there must be difficulties as of now in getting those classes of skilled labour to move but if as i am postulating the rents in the areas to which we are trying to attract industry are lower there will be a greater attraction for the skilled workers to move particularly from areas in which they can sell their houses at high prices <e> <s> so they will make a double gain and i should have thought it was bound to increase the willingness to be mobile <e> <s> no one can say whether it will increase mobility but it could at least set the scene to make it easier for people to move <e> <s> but on that point i think the second answer to the noble lord is to look at clause which is purely on the question of the allocation of public authority houses <e> <s> there special attention has to be given to the question of mobility so that priority can be given when necessary to mobility <e> <s> but that is another question we shall come to in due course <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord thurso may well be right <e> <s> the point is that one has to adjust the figure this is a matter of judgment not just to bring the houses on the market but to ensure that they will be sold <e> <s> if one merely brings them on the market and the discount allowed is not big enough to sell them then ones efforts will be wasted <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock said that one does not know what the houses are going to be sold at it has not been decided <e> <s> the only test is when they come on the market <e> <s> but a judgment has to be made to get things moving <e> <s> nobody has put forward any other credible judgment to put against the careful judgment which has been made by the scottish office <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not fallacious to take improvements made to a house as necessarily adding proportionately to the value of the house <e> <s> one knows from ones own house when one has made an improvement that has cost a lot of money that that improvement is sometimes not reflected in the value of the house when one comes to sell it <e> <s> that is a common experience <e> <s> that being so i fail to see why it should be necessary to say that this will not affect the discount <e> <s> the discount comes from the market value of the house and has no near connection i was going to say no necessary connection but no near connection with the cost of improvements done <e>", "<cs> if i may answer <e>", "<cs> would it be possible for my noble friend when we get to the report stage to give us some idea of the co-ordination or co-operation if he likes between all these bodies and the islands and district councils <e> <s> because the accumulated right of the time during which the applicants to buy a house have been employed by and have been occupying a house of the various authorities listed is as i understand it all of no avail unless they are given a house by the district council <e> <s> ought we not to know the attitudes of the district councils the islands councils and so on <e> <s> do they have a single attitude to it <e> <s> how will this work out in practice <e>", "<cs> may there not be a simpler explanation <e> <s> if one looks back to amendment no <e> <s> surely there is a question not just of terminology but of fact because the date of the notice might not be the date on which it was served and the date has been changed to service <e> <s> therefore you have to alter send to serve in any case to match that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend a brief question <e> <s> paragraph of schedule says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord belstead on the admirable way in which he opened this debate and then go on to express my surprise on this particular subject at being put in to bat so high up the list <e> <s> we have had the most knowledgeable a nasty word but it is meant well speeches from those illustrious in the world of broadcasting and i am to be followed by one who was chairman of the iba and here am i coming in to bat now simply because on every point except one that has been mentioned i am in agreement with the speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood correctly the noble lord who has just spoken he is really advocating that the qualifying period should start to run from the passage of the bill and not start right away so that within the three or five years whichever it may be such people have some experience of what goes on in a house <e> <s> it does not much matter from any point of view whether they own that house or whether <e>", "<cs> my lords while amendment no <e> <s> has the appearance of tidiness it contains a fatal flaw <e> <s> as i read it it would enable the occupier to buy without vacant possession <e> <s> it would mean if paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend replies would he also tell us why these undesirable people are still council tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also say how welcome this amendment is <e> <s> may i draw attention to one small point <e> <s> it seems incongruous that one should have two definitions in the same bill of regular armed forces of the crown <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that there is a definition in clause of the bill where it admittedly says in this section <e> <s> but if it were thought fit it might make it a little more tidy to introduce this amendment on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord ross of marnock was at some pains to try and make out that what we had decided at the report stage decided by a majority should not be applicable <e> <s> of course you can always make small changes in an amendment that is defeated at report stage but if on that basis you arc going to bring it back here you are surely at variance with the standing orders of this house <e> <s> the noble lord makes a grimace as if he thinks this is trivial but it is not <e> <s> it is not by any means so <e> <s> our standing orders are expressed in very mild terms but they are nevertheless binding as the practice of the house and are generally regarded so <e> <s> i share this experience with the noble lord because shortly after i first came to this house a year after i was on the opposition benches and i too was taken to task for trying to use third reading to reverse a decision that had been taken on report <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is for the house to rule it out of order <e> <s> the house is the custodian <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether at the time we are debating in the other chamber after the false ceiling has been put in place work will be going on above us and what will be the effect of that on audibility <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend can answer this question <e> <s> how long in fact did it take to pay the amounts of compensation due or whatever you like to call it <e> <s> what were the delays and what was the amount of interest that was paid in the meantime on the outstanding amounts due <e> <s> that is one form of retroaction that would always be approved where there is undue delay in payment and interest has not been paid <e>", "<cs> i am not certain what the noble lord means by the fourth channel being represented on the board <e> <s> does he mean that the subsidiary company which gathers the programme together should be represented on the board <e>", "<cs> willingly and i have with me a paper which lists them <e> <s> just to give some of the headings they are the collaborative fixing of rates between television contractors the itca which is the independent television contractors association and its cancellation committee package selling which i understand is to enhance the price of the cheaper spots and possibly slightly to decrease the price of the more expensive ones the deliberate under-selling of air time the london weekend gold star rate double standards on special programmes preempt rate cards which is a quite astonishing practice by which it seems the television contractors cannot be held to an agreement as to the price they make if somebody comes along and is willing to pay a better price <e> <s> i do not think i need go through them all and my noble friend will see the kind of practices there are <e>", "<cs> they are malpractices in the eyes of one side of those who make the agreements and as they are fairly universal there is reason to <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is what is meant <e> <s> it would of course be impossible for all areas to have the same rates because the number of viewers in the different areas vary very much and the programmes are divided into various types with different rates applying to them <e> <s> in fact the price on the rate cards is seldom the price that has to be paid <e>", "<cs> yes certainly though it may take a little time <e> <s> programme companies operate a system of collaboration when fixing air time rates <e> <s> draft rate cards are circulated between the principle programme companies for their own internal information before they are announced to the advertising agencies <e> <s> it is not known whether copies of such communications are furnished to the office of fair trading in compliance with the provisions of the restrictive trade practices act <e> <s> the isba submits that this is an anti-competitive practice <e>", "<cs> i do not quite see how what my noble friend has just said is relevant to this argument <e> <s> we are talking about the fourth channel where there is only one set of programmes <e> <s> there is no competition there <e> <s> the competition would be between two sets of bodies serving the advertising agencies and the advertisers in the provision of air time within a particular area <e> <s> that is where the competition would lie <e> <s> the suggestion is that the advertisers and advertising agencies are not adequately served in fact they are rather dictated to by the tv contractors at the present time and that if there were competition for the fourth channel there would be competition in service <e>", "<cs> what action <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may at least comment on some of the things that my noble friend has said <e> <s> first of all perhaps i could comment on one point that the noble lord lord donaldson has made <e> <s> he talked about an argument between two groups all making a great deal of money out of advertising <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> it is an argument between a group which is making a great deal of money out of it and a group which is paying a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> it is important for the argument because obviously the advertisers need to advertise and they come along to obtain air space or air time or whatever you like to call it <e> <s> what we are really arguing here is that look at it how you like the programme contracting companies are in business and they are trading in air time or air space <e> <s> it is up to whichever regulating authority has the responsibility to see that the balance between these two is fairly held <e> <s> of course the needs of the advertisers are not paramount <e> <s> i am sorry if i gave the impression they were <e> <s> all i was asking was for a fair deal between the two sides <e>", "<cs> oh yes parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> but in that the authority is making a general report on the treatment of complaints that the authority has received <e> <s> what i asked my noble friend in the course of his remarks and i hope he will forgive me for interrupting him is what action can the authority take <e> <s> he has left us entirely in the air <e> <s> there is no action for the authority to take in the case of abuses <e> <s> i have given in my amendments examples of what could be done and i still think that these courses should be taken quite independently of the question of whether there should be competition in the sale of air time <e> <s> this of course is what we are talking about primarily but i am bound to say that i think my noble friend was arguing the case as i presented it in the last stage on second reading when we were talking about the setting up of a separate subsidiary company to collect the advertising revenue rather than allowing the present itv programme companies to do it <e>", "<cs> i find myself a little in favour with almost everything that has been said but not wholly in favour of anything <e> <s> i am bound to welcome the agreement of the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that the authority should be able to do something but i am not certain that it would be right to act upon the rate card for the reasons given both by my noble friend lord de la warr and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i expressed the view that the authority should have some enforcement powers <e> <s> however can it really be on the rate card <e> <s> i sense some connection with the price commission here <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord ponsonby perhaps even in spite of himself is psychologically drawn back to the days of the price commission and the kind of controls that were exercised then <e>", "<cs> my lords does the home office consult with the scottish office and bring the practice into line for the whole of the united kingdom in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend comment on or confirm the noble lords premise that segregation <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question as a preliminary <e> <s> i should like to know how the minister interprets the phrase <e>", "<cs> a couple of points have not been mentioned one of them a philosophical point <e> <s> my noble friend spoke about a service being paid for but i think there is a confusion of thought here <e> <s> what is being paid for is a right which was previously taken away by the public service but that does not mean they are paying for a service <e> <s> even if we were to agree that there should be payment for that right what happens if the right is refused <e> <s> does the charge still stand <e> <s> why should it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would reconsider that reply because i should have thought it was very unlikely that it would lead to any considerable delay <e> <s> this is a common aspect of procedure at inquiries under various acts and it seems to me imperative that the parties should have an opportunity to correct the facts not to produce new arguments <e> <s> it cannot lead to new arguments <e> <s> it is a question of correcting the facts and this is all that is being asked for <e> <s> i commend this amendment to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> with great respect that is not what the amendment says <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> but it does not follow that you have to consult all the parties <e>", "<cs> it would be a pity if the debate were to pass without any voice being raised in favour of the present situation <e> <s> as i understand it the primary difference between a conservation area and an area of special control lies in the fact that in a conservation area the local authority has control over all advertisements individually <e> <s> it can prevent advertisements from being set up it can cause them to be taken down <e> <s> the position is different in an area of special control <e> <s> as my noble friend lord duncan-sandys mentioned in such an area the only advertisements allowed are those in which the size of the lettering is limited which give the name of the advertiser state the goods that he sells or the activities that he pursues and are displayed on his own premises <e> <s> advertisements not displayed on premises belonging to the advertiser are not allowed regardless of whether they would be on special sites pillars bus shelters or wherever <e> <s> that is the position <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> it must have been a slip of the tongue i meant to say must <e> <s> i am told i did say must i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> may i address myself to the first amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the point made is a good one <e> <s> apparently what these amendments are trying to do i commend it is to give an opportunity for a falsehood or a false impression to be corrected <e> <s> it does not matter whether the falsehood or the false impression is made deliberately or inadvertently <e> <s> what is required is that it should be corrected <e> <s> no doubt the correction will be taken up not only on the radio and television but in the press as well <e> <s> it is almost certain to be given pretty wide coverage <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the noble and learned lord this <e> <s> would he not agree that the broadcasting authorities are always anxious to have the truth established <e> <s> it is not the authorities who are guilty of any shortcomings if i may put it in that way in this connection it is the authors of the programmes themselves who have had the opportunity to prepare the programmes and ought to have checked all the facts <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord not agree therefore that when a complaint is made the authorities themselves are only too anxious to rectify them but they will not be so willing to do so unless a complaint is made and unless they themselves think the matter of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> may i add one word <e> <s> on this occasion i find myself very much in agreement with the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> if i may say so based on my experience of having been chairman of a non-statutory authority to the advertising standards authority it has always seemed right to refer the complaint in the first place to the person against whom the complaint is alleged and to get their statement before taking further action <e> <s> this seems to me entirely proper <e> <s> i do not know about the exact drafting of this amendment but i would certainly support this in principle <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could come back on what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> again i have to refer to my experience as far as it is relevant <e> <s> that is that of course there were occasions when complaints were received and the complaint was obviously ill-founded or frivolous and could be dismissed right away and this was done <e> <s> the complaint went directly to the commission to the authority and i really do not see why it should not go direct to the commission and then the commission should not refer it to the broadcasting authority for their comments in a kind of interlocutory way <e> <s> that is the way it is described in scotland at any rate <e> <s> this in practice does not hold things up it tends to make them be dealt with more <e>", "<cs> it makes a tremendous difference whether you have the hearing in public or in private how the case is to be heard <e> <s> i have been looking at the bill while this discussion has taken place and i do not see that there is any right for a complainant to be represented <e> <s> if a complainant was represented and if everybody was watching very carefully what was said as lawyers do or are supposed to do no doubt there would be something to be said for the hearing to be in public <e> <s> but if the complainant himself were stating his case and the broadcasting organisation were stating theirs in reply there would be a very great deal to be said for a private hearing in the calmest possible atmosphere <e> <s> i imagine that most of the complaints will be from not very high-powered people from people not experienced in public speaking <e>", "<cs> i am bound to take exception to the form in which this is done <e> <s> if an advisory committee for scotland is to be appointed it must be by the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> in any case <e>", "<cs> i see after consultation but i do not quite see the point of having this clause in that form <e> <s> if you want to say the secretary of state that is all that is required <e> <s> the secretary of state in scotland is the secretary of state for scotland the secretary of state in wales is the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> i think on a point of principle it would be quite wrong to put it <e>", "<cs> is there not a quite different question involved here <e> <s> if you are setting up a local radio station in an area which is not touched at the moment by a local radio station then that is quite all right because you have no interests which are being adversely affected thereby <e> <s> but if you are dividing up an area which is already covered as i imagine you would be doing if it was all conurban there are aspects where you would almost think that questions of compensation might arise <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> if that is so ought we not to take page line first <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i venture to draw attention to what seems to me to be a minor mistake in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not think that it should be there at all <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will kindly look at the amendment because otherwise there will be two ofs together <e> <s> the point is that it says <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the sole justification for dealing with this matter in this way that is to say drafting as a clause into this bill virtually the whole act of can be that there is no difference between the two acts <e> <s> otherwise surely it would be necessary to have this fully debated in this house whether or not it was debated three or four years ago <e> <s> it would be most unusual for it not to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords has not this amendment already fallen <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about whether the clause should be retained in the bill <e> <s> we are not talking about the past <e> <s> we must have regard to recent experience <e> <s> i listened with great interest and as always with admiration to the speech of lord shackleton <e> <s> he said that it is difficult to get this kind of bill through by way of private members bills <e> <s> was not this bill too important a bill to go through by that means <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lords questions are not relevant to the issues that we are discussing <e> <s> there is no evidence that the scottish people are behind this <e> <s> however there can be no doubt that people in scotland know that it is against the law <e> <s> that has a great deterrent effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say privilege i said time <e>", "<cs> may i ask just one question <e> <s> perhaps it is a related question <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm that instructions were given to the draftsmen to bring this new bill into line this is the right phrase to use it is the phrase that was used by mr heseltine when asked by mr hattersley what he meant with the english bill <e> <s> when he received the drafts were he himself and the secretary of state satisfied that those instructions had been carried out <e> <s> that is the important thing <e> <s> it is very difficult for us to be sure how exactly the two bills match up in the circumstances in the light of what has been referred to as the technicalities involved <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will be able to give us that assurance and if so i hope the house will accept it <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend would allow me to say that it was not as sweeping as all that <e> <s> it was immediately qualified by the words <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government intensify their references to the office of fair trading to investigate the price of monopolies in general and also in particular of the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply say that i listened with the greatest of attention and my usual enjoyment to what the noble lord lord mishcon had to say and what he said seemed to me very persuasive although i did not agree with his point in regard to serious because there are precedents there <e> <s> having listened to my noble friend i think that he has answered all the points that the noble lord raised certainly to my satisfaction <e> <s> in those circumstances i shall certainly support him if there is a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming very much my noble friends reply may i ask him to confirm that the commission intends that no agricultural product included in the proposed gsp product list will be dropped in the five-year period to <e> <s> will my noble friend press for an assurance that during that comparatively long period products can be added to the list <e> <s> i have in mind those from the least developed countries in particular for example pakistan rice <e> <s> will my noble friend also press for an assurance that the common interests of the least developed countries and the consumers in the community will be fully taken into account in the light of what commissioner haferkamp has described as this very complex and delicate balancing exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the selling of these parts constitute an offence in law or can it be dealt with by the office of fair trading <e> <s> may i ask what additional measures the government are able to take in the matter of these passing-off attempts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend wishes to be fair <e> <s> he will recall that i explained this at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> this has been a very useful exercise because it has brought out clearly i believe for the first time exactly what is involved how far the secretary of state is going to be active in this and what he expects of the authority <e> <s> certainly my misgivings are alleviated <e> <s> he has said clearly that the main sanction is for the secretary of state to prohibit a practice and that this can be done through the monopolies and mergers commission at the instance of the director general of fair trading <e> <s> there seems to be an adequate means of enforcement <e> <s> certainly what is in doubt is whether it is a speedy means of enforcement <e> <s> these procedures may take a very long time indeed and in the end we may fall back upon the non-renewal of the contract so long do the procedures take sometimes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one or two observations on what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i do not think he should be carried away with the glory of creation <e> <s> to many senses when one is writing about history one is not creating one is reconstructing and what those who are reconstructing in that way must recognise is that they have a duty to establish the facts so far as possible <e> <s> very often if they create falsehoods it is because they have not done their homework properly <e> <s> i am not too certain that five years is sufficient <e> <s> those who are writing for television ought to exercise the very greatest care and consult all their sources <e> <s> in the context of an ordinary report in a newspaper editors are asking all the time have you checked all your facts <e> <s> the same should apply to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the amendment might not be improved by adding at the end something to the effect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a brief word here <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also another consideration of course and that is that as the noble lord lord goodman said this is not a court of law and it would seem that it is best in the interests of the fluency of the complainant and also of time to make the proceedings as informal as possible <e> <s> what is going to emerge at the end of it is expressed in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer which correctly interprets what was in the forefront of my mind will he confirm that the heavy fuel oil duty in this country is twice what it is in germany a hundred times what it is in france and a hundred and sixty times what it is in italy <e> <s> would not the removal of this duty go some way at any rate towards making industry more competitive in export markets <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend brings this matter to the attention of his right honourable friend will he also take into account that according to a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene briefly to highlight one particular aspect of this order <e> <s> i should like to join in the congratulations to the government on bringing off an arrangement which puts an end to a serious situation nevertheless leaving a difficult situation remaining <e> <s> i should like if i may to compliment my noble friend on the way he introduced this order it was a model of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been here recently the noble lord has come just recently <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend in which other european countries similar withdrawals were made and in what quantities <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage in the debate it seems to me that almost everything that needs to be said has been said but there is one thing that has not been said and i am surprised it has not been mentioned at all even by the noble lord lord crowther-hunt <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> in professor dicey published <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will forgive me in his view what would happen if licences had been given by more than one country for the same staked-out area <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him what estimate he has made of what this will bring in on earnings above the upper limit <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord to clarify his general intentions here <e> <s> if i may say so and i am not of course criticising the chair in any way it came as a surprise to me that if this amendment were accepted the next amendment could not be called <e> <s> i had imagined that the noble lord was intending that the extra contribution for those above the earnings limit was to be related to the diminished extra contribution that those within the two limits were going to have to pay <e> <s> in other words instead of paying per cent <e> <s> extra they would be paying one quarter per cent <e> <s> extra <e> <s> i had envisaged that the two amendments hung together and that it was intended that the one would compensate for the other <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is seriously telling us after all the times in another place where he has opposed financial resolutions and argued about them that what has been said in another place and what the financial resolution contains do not matter <e> <s> here the noble lord lord houghton is arguing that we are really talking right outside the financial resolution because this is in fact a tax <e> <s> i have looked at the financial resolution and it seems to me perfectly plain that it is right outside the financial resolution <e> <s> surely he is not arguing that it is for us to put forward and pass amendments which are outside the financial resolution merely because we think this is something better to do <e> <s> incidentally may i ask for a clarification here <e> <s> my noble friend beside me points out that we are dealing with the social security contributions bill and i find the marshalled list says social security contributions bill hl <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend may have thought that this bill was now starting <e>", "<cs> i should like to put a matter to my noble friend before she replies <e> <s> i quite understand the suspicion of the noble lord opposite as regards this matter but i would not credit him with a suspicious nature <e> <s> i am bound to say that there is some logical reason for withdrawing the treasury supplement over the years <e> <s> but i think that the noble lord is entitled and i should also like to know this to get some idea of what the government have in mind now <e> <s> i can visualise the circumstances in which they would wish to increase the contribution <e> <s> indeed if we take it historically i think that was the reason for <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister to say for the record whether there is any precedent in the national insurance fund for duties or obligations being imposed for only one year <e>", "<cs> so far as somebody might imitate it in the future yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word in reply to what the noble lord lord spens has said <e> <s> of course it is true that in this bill the self-employed are being treated in the same way as everybody else <e> <s> the calculations seem to work out against the self-employed but this is because of their particular situation <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is wrong in his complaint that he has not received any support from this side of the house <e> <s> i suggest to him that if he looks back over the years for example to the occasions when my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and i had to deal with the up-rating he will see that we were at pains to keep down as much as possible the contributions of the self-employed because we recognised those arguments <e> <s> i returned to being self-employed just at the time when the bill was going through parliament and it was then that we were penalised so very heavily absolutely astonishingly heavily <e>", "<cs> my lords it is really a matter for my noble friend to answer but i would

great deal of public loss and public dismay <e>", "<cs> may i simply say that i think it is desirable to keep imprisonment <e> <s> you never know what people will get up to <e> <s> there could be quite serious offences for which the financial penalty by itself would not be appropriate <e> <s> there might be very cruel offences <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might make a short intervention and make a suggestion because there is a point here which worries me <e> <s> we are dealing with a money bill and this is really a money point so that we could not in any way amend the bill to put this right <e> <s> i accept entirely the advantages that the redundancy legislation has afforded <e> <s> one of the objects of redundancy payments in cutting down the number of persons employed in a particular industry was to improve productivity at a time when there were opportunities in other industries to absorb those made redundant <e> <s> however the immediate prospects have changed <e> <s> firms are now having to slim down in order to survive at all <e> <s> to the extent that firms have to make redundancy payments their chances of survival may be imperilled <e>", "<cs>

satisfy himself that there is sufficient guidance for the <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl has gone a long way towards satisfying me <e> <s> i am not all that difficult to satisfy <e> <s> but it seems to me that there are buildings which do not necessarily go with the house <e> <s> they go with one of the two people

satisfied me and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have been here for most of the time i was away for just over half an hour <e>", "<cs> may i make a short observation with the

and get married here within what used to be called forbidden relation ships <e> <s> what happens when they go back to scotland <e> <s> are they there married or are they not <e> <s> this seems to be a kind of gretna in reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the spirit in which my noble friend has moved this amendment <e> <s> i am not certain that this is the only way in which this amendment could be made <e> <s> the intention as i understand it is that throughout this bill the words titled and non-titled should be replaced by entitled and not entitled which seems sensible <e> <s> if because of the possibility of confusion anybody doubts that i can recall a bill which provided a definition of a word and then said in this bill this word will mean so-and-so except where the context requires otherwise <e> <s> surely that can be done perfectly easily if it is thought that the word titled is in any way confusing <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am correct in thinking that the answer to the questions of my noble friend lord selkirk are to be found in a very obtuse corner of the bill which is the definition of the matrimonial home <e> <s> line on page states <e>", "<cs> my lords if the legal title of the owner of the house comes to an end in one way or another ought not that to obliterate the right of occupancy whether the right of occupancy is that of the person entitled to occupy entitled to possession or the person who is not so entitled <e> <s> i think that i have spoken long enough for my noble friend to be able to give the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the regulations will come out at the same time as this part of the bill comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the regulations referred to in amendment no <e> <s> giving the form in which the consent is to be made will be in operation at the same time as the bill comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible that the property might be associated or connected with the matrimonial home <e> <s> for example property lying around the matrimonial home <e> <s> i understand that the matrimonial home is limited by definition to the actual house and what is required to be used with the house as a domestic home <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help thinking that the noble lord has a point <e> <s> the more we can keep these matters out of the hands of the courts the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would invite the house to look at this question in a little more depth <e> <s> in this clause we are dealing with the question of how far if at all should the scottish law commissions recommendations for occupancy rights of married couples be extended to two individuals who are living together as man and wife a cohabiting couple <e> <s> what does the commission say about the question <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept in fact i noticed it myself after putting in the amendment that the words residing with are not appropriate <e> <s> the child might be temporarily residing elsewhere but that is a matter that could easily have been amended <e> <s> i recognise there are other conditions that the court may have to take into consideration <e> <s> i do not propose to press this amendment but i intend to make clear my view that the number of considerations which would warrant the court continuing for a considerable time the occupancy of the partner with no title to the house are limited and they should be used with discretion <e> <s> discretion is the word <e> <s> there is a wide discretion given to the courts in this matter far wider in a way than is given in the rest of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that that is proper but i think we ought to lay down broad lines within which that discretion should be used <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that unless it is already clear on the face of it that the couple are cohabiting it will be extremely difficult on the basis of certainly the first consideration the time in which it appears they have lived together for the court to come to any decision <e> <s> there are hundreds and thousands of men looked after by women who without being married live under the same roof for many years <e> <s> they do not cohabit in the ordinary sense of the word <e> <s> i suppose it may be that at some stage for some reason an application might be made <e> <s> i suppose it will be a rarity but all the same there is the possibility <e> <s> i do not deny that the consideration is germane but i doubt whether it should be elevated into one of the two main criteria in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords before leaving subsection may i thank my noble friend for the amendments that he made earlier following upon suggestions that i made <e> <s> i had omitted to thank him earlier <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful my lords <e> <s> i do not know what to say <e> <s> on the whole the fewer the words the better <e> <s> if my noble friend is satisfied that the words are unnecessary i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what noble lords have said on this question which i recognise is a difficult and somewhat distasteful one <e> <s> one does not like to challenge a recommendation of the scottish law commission on a matter of this kind but i cannot help feeling it might have been better to have obtained experience of the working of the rest of the bill before introducing this clause which could have been introduced as a separate bill and possibly elaborated to a considerable extent <e> <s> there is the fear that the right to seek occupancy from the court will be abused <e> <s> if this is retained we shall just have to wait and see <e> <s> human nature is not that straightforward and there are possibilities for blackmail and the like <e> <s> i am not sure either that we can be really satisfied that the question of violence cannot be dealt with in other ways <e> <s> there is already legislation for england i believe which deals with violence in the home in other ways <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also join in thanking my noble friend for the way in which he has dealt with this bill <e> <s> as he knows i am by no means yet satisfied on clause which deals with cohabiting <e> <s> i think there is liable to be a lot of trouble in this <e> <s> it is always difficult to make a partial extension of a principle to circumstances which are in many ways totally different and i think great care will have to be taken i am sure it will be taken in another place to examine the kind of circumstances in which applications will be made in cases of cohabitation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add to the point made by the noble earl lord st aldwyn <e> <s> only this morning i was listening to a bbc programme which referred to some perhaps humbler arrangements parish records <e> <s> it is a fact that pages are taken out of them from time to time and i cannot see how this can be avoided <e> <s> i do not believe this is something worth risking when for a comparatively small cost we can maintain a tradition going back years <e> <s> there is something peculiarly appealing about a list of signatures whether it is one made at the time of king charless death or whatever <e> <s> i think this is something peculiarly associated with our history and i believe we should support the amendment <e>", "<cs> where i do not agree with noble lords opposite is that it is improper as i think they have rather implied to make this sort of change by means of an affirmative resolution order <e> <s> after all it is perfectly easy for the house to reject an affirmative order on a single point and the noble lord lord ross of marnock himself has indicated that there is a time pressure on this because of the necessity of giving i think he said two years notice of it <e> <s> in a case like this the sooner it is done the better <e> <s> i would not myself dissent from what the bill now says <e> <s> but on the second point i think there is possibly an argument for going some way towards the purpose of the noble lord as lord hughes has indicated <e> <s> it might be better to limit the period in which postponement could be made to two years <e> <s> i would suggest that my noble friend might consider that whatever the house of commons may have thought <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what the opposition want to achieve here <e> <s> as i understand it the clause is not about what improvements should be exempted or should qualify for rating but when the rates should be increased and therefore i do not see how this quite major amendment could be fitted into the clause <e> <s> secondly because the clause deals with when the increase in rates in respect of an improvement or alteration should be made it would create an unfairness between those who have already received an increased valuation <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may dissent from what i say but the clause says <e>", "<cs> that would apply only in relation to those houses into which a heating installation was made after the bill was passed <e>", "<cs> without accepting or refusing that suggestion it would be inoperative unless the noble lord lord ross withdrew the amendment now <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say how many members there are on this advisory council at the present time in total <e>", "<cs> i should just like to add one word or two <e> <s> two thoughts are involved here <e> <s> one concerns the normal case of tree preservation orders of an amenity character although one can vary that because <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend a question on one point <e> <s> he referred to the fact that an appeal would remain <e> <s> could he explain that <e>", "<cs> i wish to contribute one or two sentences merely because many years ago i was the junior minister who dealt with agriculture in scotland and i spent much of my time seeking to promote the need for understanding and the practice of integration between forestry and other land uses and i have no doubt whatsoever that it is most important <e> <s> my sole doubt is as to whether it is right to place the duty of promoting this only on the forestry commissioners <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will find a way to introduce this idea but i hope too that at the next stage of the bill he will adjust the wording <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to think that in this case the noble lord lord ross of marnock has got it right <e> <s> the word is designate it is not appoint <e> <s> my noble friend may have used the word appoint <e> <s> it is a word which is often used as a synonym for designate but if one wishes to be accurate it is just as well to use the right word <e> <s> a case has been made out for my noble friend to take back this point and look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say on behalf of my noble friend lord campbell that i know how very much he appreciates the steps that my noble friend has taken <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house is extremely grateful to my noble friend for having taken this initiative and indeed for influencing his colleagues to ensure that it extends to the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm the figures of per cent <e> <s> because the figure i have is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i can follow straight on from where the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has left off since it would be very remiss of me if i were not to express my appreciation of what the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow has done in preparing the report <e> <s> i was his immediate predecessor as chairman of the sub-committee concerned and i realised how extremely lucky we were to persuade him to take on the job of considering the question of development aid <e> <s> the job was almost tailored for him and he has certainly done it superbly well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all say a word of congratulation to the noble lord lord plant on introducing this bill and express certainly my support and i am sure the support of all my noble friends on this side of the house for the purposes of the bill <e> <s> i rise to make just one comment on it <e> <s> this bill is admirably short but i am not quite sure that it is desirable to introduce bills of this kind giving a minister power to make regulations without so far as i can see any possibility for parliament to discuss the regulations at any time <e> <s> parliament is here after all to try to improve on what the civil service may do and on what ministers may do and it is not impossible that in a case of this sort with the experience of members of this house for example it might well be able to improve on what the minister might put into regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put to my noble friend a point arising out of what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said <e> <s> it is some time ago now but i seem to remember in my constituency at least one case i think two cases where the forestry commission acquired land for mixed use forestry and agriculture <e> <s> if i remember rightly in one case they disposed of the agricultural part of the land i do not know what happened in the other case <e> <s> i only say this because some doubt is therefore raised as to the proposition of lord ross of marnock that land which has been acquired for forestry should be used for forestry <e> <s> in some cases it has been mixed use both forestry and agriculture <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the point is that the noble lord is trying as i understand it to insist that forestry land should be disposed of only for forestry <e> <s> is that not so <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> now that we have passed amendment no <e> <s> am i right in thinking that it will still be necessary for children in the back seat to wear straps in other <e>", "<cs> my point can be summed up by the question for the purposes of the new clause a is a child a person <e> <s> if so it would certainly appear that clause a requires children to be strapped in when a car is being driven <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> would it be in order that we discuss amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord lord aylestone thinks but may we <e>", "<cs> we are really seeking to legislate in this bill for change <e> <s> we are legislating because things have changed so greatly since the act that it has been recognised that changes are needed in our nationality legisation <e> <s> i was sorry to hear the noble lord lord hatch of lusby attributing this bill to prejudice to closed minds to racial prejudice even on this side of the committee <e> <s> of course on the principle that britain has been an open country is already a multiracial country and was so even before the rush into this country he is right <e> <s> there is no reason to change that at all <e> <s> over the centuries people have come there to live and have been absorbed into the british nation <e> <s> i do not think that it has been sufficiently stressed here that what is actually in the bill has absolutely no racial connotation whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for having made quite clear that the substance of what i wanted is already in the bill <e> <s> as to the rest of the matter i appear to have thrown the helmet of discord among lawyers and i am quite happy now to leave the matter to the lawyers to sort out <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for saying that he will look at this question again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether the words ordinarily resident do not themselves require to be defined <e> <s> is there any legal definition of the term <e> <s> at what stage does a person become ordinarily resident <e> <s> does it at all matter that he has a home to which he returns for one month in each year <e>", "<cs> if i understood my noble friend correctly he said that there were two elements to being settled but there seems to be only one in the definition <e> <s> perhaps when we come to the definitions that would be an appropriate time to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> in that case may i say why i did not put down the words that he put down <e> <s> it was because i thought that section falls short of a definition <e> <s> that is why i put down the words that i have <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> before withdrawing the amendment could i just comment that when my noble friend the minister said that he did not see any point in putting in the signpost that i was suggesting here he gave as the reason the point that has been picked up by another noble friend lord renton that the use of the word settled is the same throughout the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that that is exactly the reason why the signpost should be put in <e> <s> if there was any doubt and the word settled was being used in different ways in different parts of the bill then that would be a good reason for not putting in the signpost <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend to take that into account also when he comes to examine this point with the draftsman <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord pitt does what he intends to do i should like to revert to a question which i asked previously <e> <s> is it the case that once the -year period is over and the child has been given british citizenship he can then leave this country and spend the rest of his life abroad <e> <s> of course we hope that he will be given a sound educational foundation in this country <e> <s> all the same in a way the -year period seems to fall between two stools <e> <s> if you are to be educated here you might as well be completely educated here and we would hope that if he was a worthy citizen he would stay here <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i really do not think i can accept what he has just said that it will be up to the person himself to judge whether the excuse is reasonable <e> <s> that is certainly not what the amendment says <e> <s> he would have to prove that the excuse was reasonable if it went to court <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether this will mean that if a passenger or a person that the driver takes as a passenger refuses to fasten his seat belt and the driver is faced with the difficult situation of saying i will not go unless you do so or of pitching the chap out that is the sort of case that this amendment would exempt from any liability for the driver not fastening his seat belt <e>", "<cs> may i put this to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not know whether this is intentional but i get the impression from the way in which this clause is drafted that what the government intend is that this exemption so far as crown service and kindred service is concerned this facility or advantage will only be extended where the government have control over the parents concerned <e> <s> if they are employed by the crown or by an organisation under the crown or in any way controlled by the crown that is all right but if they are controlled by the commission for example it is not all right <e> <s> in my view this would be entirely wrong for a number of reasons not least those stated by the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> i think we are in some danger of losing the sort of advantage that we have been looking for among others by joining the common market <e> <s> if we have a weakness in this country it is our inability to speak languages <e> <s> it is the greatest possible advantage for our citizens to be abroad learning to speak languages learning to deal with people in the common market on their own terms and at the same time with the common market not being all that far away keeping a close connection with this country <e> <s> a close connection will not i hope need to be so close that one must live here or must have a house here <e> <s> i am sure that that is not what is intended or it is certainly not what should be intended <e> <s> therefore i put it to my noble and learned friend can he say quite categorically that so far as this clause is concerned the facility offered by this clause will not be extended only to parents who are actually controlled by the government or government agency <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord home of the hirsel here <e> <s> as i understood what he said he is entirely in sympathy with the attitude taken by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter but there are difficulties <e> <s> for one thing has not my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter drawn his clause rather too widely <e> <s> i do not think he meant to say that all employees wherever recruited should have the same treatment as those who are in the civil service or in the armed forces <e> <s> i think he meant to say that those who are sent out from great britain to do these jobs should have as nearly as possible the same treatment as those in the forces <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely certain of that <e> <s> i did have that point in mind and i did look at it rather carefully but i thought it was liable to a different interpretation <e> <s> i think that what we are all really concerned with is the very strong feeling that a great many people in this country have that they want to <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether or not this is exactly the sort of case which might be covered by clause <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend leaves that point may i mention to him that he has spoken about the church <e> <s> would he extend that to the churches <e>", "<cs> it seems to me as though it would be wise for me to say to my noble and learned friend that this is one of the cases where he should perhaps consider what has been said about this after we have finished with clause <e> <s> i think that a great deal of comment will take place on clause because i do not see how we can restrict this only to companies in the context of which we have been talking <e> <s> we would have to take it wider in view of the fact that my noble and learned friend has made it so clear that the employment can be with a company or association established in the united kingdom not as the base so to speak but as one of the six sets of circumstances that are outlined here five of which relate to employment overseas and only the one to employment in this country <e>", "<cs> if i may speak on my amendment and have it discussed at the same time as my noble friends amendment i do not know what view my noble friend takes of amendment no <e> <s> which is spelt out in a little more detail than the amendment of the noble lord lord geddes but may i refer my noble friend back to something he said <e> <s> it is difficult on any particular issue take one instance of one doctor in san francisco to say how are we going to prove that what he is doing is of benefit to the united kingdom <e> <s> the fact is that collectively self-employed people of this kind doctors consultants engineering consultants professors and all the rest of it in their own way make an impact but collectively they make a very considerable impact in favour of great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make an observation on what has been said by my noble friend <e> <s> surely the rule that he has just explained presupposes that there have been two previous occasions when this matter has been discussed <e> <s> in fact this particular amendment was first moved at report stage and so there has only been one previous opportunity to discuss it <e>", "<cs> could i begin by saying that for my part i would not expect my noble friend on the front bench to be able to accept many amendments at this stage because of the great complication of the bill and because he will have to go away and think about what we have said and see how it ties in with the rest of the bill <e> <s> i have every confidence that he will do that and i hope that we shall see the results at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> as one who was not as clear as i might have been about the meaning of the clause without these words and at that time not having seen this amendment i welcome this clarification very much indeed <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will forgive me for intervening for a moment <e> <s> he will observe that this is an amendment to an amendment <e> <s> i am proposing to leave out the subsection altogether which will simplify the matter <e> <s> will my noble friend also bear in mind that the word firm has a slightly different connotation in scotland <e>", "<cs> i should like clarification of the situation in which we now find ourselves <e> <s> i have spoken to a large number of amendments and have also referred to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i gather that my noble and learned friend has replied to me on amendments nos <e> <s> and and said that he will look into this with a view to bringing in more appropriate amendments in lieu of them <e> <s> he has accepted in principle the amendments to include the word firm but again he is also going to consider what is the most appropriate form of amendment <e> <s> is the situation that he wants me to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i see that my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i do not want to hold your lordships up on this but may i point out where in the case of one or two things i think my noble friend has not quite seized what i was after <e> <s> really the whole point of making this effort to extend the avenues to british citizenship is that there are wide areas that are not covered in the earlier part of the clause <e> <s> my noble friend seems to have a fixation about being employed in british industry for example as if it were that you could not maintain your connections with this country unless you were employed by a british firm <e> <s> surely that cannot be correct <e> <s> that is one of the main reasons why i have drafted my amendment in this way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and the noble lord lord mishcon for what has been said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will pay great <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for what he has said <e> <s> the idea which he has put forward is excellent and i hope that it will receive consideration <e> <s> my noble and learned friend has dealt with the matter very sympathetically but i have the feeling that he has done it in a case where the government had so to speak three trays in out and too difficult and that this went into the too difficult tray <e> <s> i still feel that the way in which this would work out in normal circumstances if the parents died when they were abroad and had remained in touch as will happen in most cases with their relatives in this country is that a relative would go out from this country collect the child bring it back and probably have it adopted by somebody <e> <s> probably this would be a very good solution which would give rise to another circumstance <e>", "<cs> that is perhaps something for the next stage of the bill <e> <s> there are two separate ways of looking at this <e> <s> my noble and learned friend spoke about the way in which the secretary of state proposes to exercise his discretion whereas others have spoken about the sort of cases in which he might be called upon to exercise his discretion which i think is more what the noble lord lord mishcon had in mind <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that my noble and learned friend will consider this again and individual peers also no doubt will consider it but at the moment it looks as though it is too difficult and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are talking here about a definition of the words close connection <e> <s> what i understand the noble lord lord mishcon has been talking about is not a definition but a description of the way in which the words will be interpreted <e> <s> if one looks for example at the national insurance scheme there is a separate pamphlet for every single item that can possibly be covered by national insurance <e> <s> so it does not seem to me to be too much to ask that at the end of the day there should be a pamphlet about this not just one giving a description of the whole scheme such as the red booklet which exists at the present time but one giving greater amplification of the way in which the scheme as a whole will work <e> <s> it is for consideration and it is a way out of reaching a decision on this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble and learned friend whether it is envisaged that just as application can be made through high commissioners offices to the secretary of state as i understand my noble and learned friend to have just said application will be made in many cases through the consular offices <e> <s> i should have thought that one reason for even the five years extension is to enable those who go to the consulate to make their registration to be told that they cannot do it after the five years <e> <s> the consulates will be able to do it for the five years <e> <s> their role thereafter will be to say im sorry i cannot do it but i shall forward your application to the secretary of state <e> <s> that would be one way to deal with the question <e> <s> i cannot see that it would have been all that difficult to include in the bill a provision for the customary registration with consulates to be extended to high commissions <e> <s> as to the question of discrimination between males and females if you can register a male you can just as easily register a female <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble and learned friend can he confirm as appears from the opening words of this clause that for the first time female children will be registered in consular offices overseas <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> can he explain why they had to wait all this time in great hardship <e> <s> was it not because they were deprived of their livelihoods where they were and that that is where the hardhip came from <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend on the front bench would be able to tell us which countries do not allow dual nationality <e> <s> i do not expect him to give a complete list but the point is that there are many countries to which people from this country may go where there would be strong pressure on them to acquire the nationality of the country they have gone to if they want to make their career a success there <e> <s> those same countries may be countries which do not allow dual nationality to be held <e>", "<cs> i warmly support what my noble friend said <e> <s> she emphasised that the scope of the amendment is relatively small because this paragraph seems to relate only to persons born outside the united kingdom before commencement <e> <s> at an earlier stage in clause we had raised the matter of a person born outside the united kingdom after commencement <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to look at both these amendments in parallel and together because it is going to be important for recruitment in the future and for the service of this country <e>", "<cs> further to what the noble lord lord avebury has said may i ask my noble friend what exactly is the status of a child born to a parent <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that both of my noble friends have rather a fixation about the possibility that a child who comes home for education here is almost certain because of the fact that he was born abroad to go abroad again <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite extraordinary <e> <s> it seems that the options should be kept open the whole time and that the methods adopted to judge whether or not the child should himself become a british citizen or even a british citizen by descent must leave the option open to the latest possible moment <e> <s> the idea that the choice should be made within three years or whatever is just absurd <e>", "<cs> may i also have a copy of that letter as i raised this point at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> i have very great sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble lord lord avebury although i am bound to say that i am not quite certain that it is the right way to tackle the problem <e> <s> it appears to me that the noble lord is deeming as it were the european community members to be part of great britain <e> <s> that roughly is what the amendment amounts to for this purpose <e> <s> i should have thought that we had discussed this matter fairly fully previously on at least two occasions and that the noble lord could be content with the addition of what he has just said and with the undertaking that was given that the matter would be looked at thoroughly to see what is the best way of dealing with what i think we have demonstrated to the government is a real problem <e> <s> for my part i would hope that the noble lord would do that <e>", "<cs> i think i understand the point of the noble lord lord spens which perhaps out of delicacy he has not make too explicit but is there not a danger that by putting it in this way we may be giving recognition to the division in cyprus and giving recognition which i believe we do not do at the present time which i must say i depricate to the turkish-speaking territory in cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords as i troubled the front bench quite a lot on the earlier stages i think it would only be polite if i were to say how very pleased i am at the way in which the government have dealt with this difficult problem and have shown a great deal of ingenuity and goodwill in it <e> <s> i cannot say that i am wholly satisfied with this and i would rather hope to have an opportunity of reading exactly what my noble and learned friend has said particularly on the question of continuation from one generation to another <e> <s> i did not quite understand what he said about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the spirit in which my noble friend has replied to this amendment <e> <s> one could go on elaborating the sort of cases which could arise <e> <s> i fully accept his assurance on the question of dealing with a case where the child is in the united kingdom although perhaps he would consider a little further the question whether he would deal with such a case as i understood him to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady trumpington for giving way <e> <s> as schedule stands at the present time naturalisation would take five years whereas this envisages a minimum period of three years so it would enable a person to be brought into the mainstream of british life at an earlier period <e> <s> considering the limitation that at the time of that persons birth his father or mother must have been a british citizen by descent i should doubt whether it really represented a great extension <e> <s> if it is an extension it is a linear extension and not a broadening out <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the house would wish to spend any more time on this amendment <e> <s> your lordships will obviously have realised that this amendment was drafted before amendment no <e> <s> appeared and was intended to ease the way particularly for self-employed people to continue a tradition of self-employment abroad or indeed to interchange from generation to generation at home or abroad or perhaps to set up links at either end <e> <s> that was the original purpose <e> <s> it seemed to me as my noble friend said that this amendment could stand on its own and could be useful <e> <s> i realise the entitlement has to stem from the parents and the connection has been in the first place from the parents but i hope we do not forget the wishes of a candidate for british citizenship and that we shall not link british citizenship entirely to the wishes and connections of the parents <e> <s> i do not think i need to say any more about this and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a word on this <e> <s> i quite understand that my noble friend lady elles is bound to withdraw her amendment because of the defect that has been created by the governments amendments <e> <s> this is so <e> <s> the secretary of state is satisfied and the government have made the amendment and this now is a defect <e> <s> perhaps that was not the most tactful way to start but i may as well say it <e> <s> i would commend this to the government <e> <s> i would say that there is a general feeling in the house that this would be a wise amendment for them to make <e> <s> while my noble friend may feel that it would not be politic if that is the right word for her to reintroduce this amendment as it would have to be amended i should like the government very seriously to consider whether they should not do it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend two questions and i think that possibly in considering them he may want to consider the matter further before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> first i understood him to say that british nationality is a term or concept not known to british law <e> <s> in that case why are we legislating about british nationality and not only legislating about it but calling this the british nationality bill <e> <s> this bill as it stands states in the long title that it is making fresh provision about nationality and yet as has been said nationality is not mentioned in the bill at all <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an extremely difficult problem representing a small detail in a very complex bill but it is a very important matter for those concerned <e> <s> i would not like to feel that the turks in cyprus were left out or felt they were left out of the bill <e> <s> it is not enough to say that we recognise the republic of cyprus as having jurisdiction over the whole country because of a past treaty <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what would be the composition of such a committee of inquiry and what would be its powers <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether other countries have suffered the same kind of export credit losses or are at any rate suffering them in parallel with ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> it relates to subparagraph ii <e> <s> i am not familiar with the word bears <e> <s> is it legal jargon or a misprint and if it is legal jargon what does it mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise a very small detail <e> <s> i wonder whether the reference to line should not be to line because otherwise the words has been acknowledged seem to be meaningless <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one question on this <e> <s> i am sure that there is a risk as the noble lord lord ross pointed out but am i right in thinking that in all these cases it is only the occupancy of the house that is transferred where it is transferred and that residual interest presumably a half interest in normal cases would remain with the entitled person <e> <s> that being so is it not likely that the entitled person would make sure that the house was not sold in other words that the entitled person would make sure that the non-entitled person who has occupancy would be in a position to maintain the payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the splitting of the clause would provide an appropriate moment to say this <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that there is a minor misprint on line page <e> <s> it does not seem to be quite grammatical <e> <s> a non-applicant <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens if the community treaties are altered as they might be in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add my congratulations to the noble lord lord geddes and concur entirely with what has been said because there is no doubt that what i may call his brilliant stroke of genius his very happy thought will confirm to all concerned to all the citizens of these territories that they are british and bring it far more to their minds and keep it before their minds which is what we believe they want <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether similar action has been taken by overseas competitors in other countries in competition with british airways <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we have not already got what my noble friend is asking for and indeed to a large extent what the noble lord lord ross is also asking for <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that we have in part i a system of licensing that covers all the cases that are required for licensing in part i and therefore it is to that extent uniform <e> <s> then as soon as we get to part ii we reach clause where we find that the secretary of state can designate any activity other than the ones specified in part i and that that same provision can adapt the system of licensing in part i to the new activity that is designated <e> <s> if that is so then i wonder whether what my noble friend is asking for is not already provided in the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend on the front bench could indicate any other form of activity that is not covered by clause <e>", "<cs> although it is done at present is it absolutely essential that the same authority should undertake both the licensing and the fixing of the fares <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also welcome this bill very much and briefly comment on what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said in regard to the special works and additional works <e> <s> if i remember rightly the scottish special housing association was to build managerial houses <e>", "<cs> at any rate my lords that is a very special function and i should like to ask my noble friend whether it is anticipated that that will still continue <e> <s> it seems necessary when you are seeking to found new industries to provide houses for them <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could refresh our memories on the question of the purchase of houses <e> <s> my recollection is that these houses have not before been offered for sale by the scottish special housing association <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock nods his head indicating that they have been offered for sale <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are sold to a sitting tenant they will be lost if the sitting tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will deal with this matter in a later order <e> <s> i need not pursue that any further but i would reiterate the need for us to know what are the new purposes because that will be an indication of what will be covered in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with all other noble lords who have paid tribute to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having given the house an opportunity to debate this subject <e> <s> i do not altogether take the view of the noble lord lord chitnis who has just sat clown that it should be somebody other than the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who should have introduced this debate long since <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am correct in saying that in all these cases there will be or should have been a report to the police <e> <s> many matters in this sphere may come to the secretary of states department but it does not necessarily follow that he need do more than look at the papers at the end and i should not have thought it would be a very great burden but perhaps my noble friend lord bellwin has further information to quantify the number of cases that might arise <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is the intention my lords <e> <s> the report deals with defective products and we have already debated that matter in this house <e> <s> but that is an entirely separate matter from road accidents and i think it better that we keep them separate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> if the scheme follows the industrial injuries scheme surely that is not so because that scheme is related to the effects <e>", "<cs> if it is an early stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> if it is a comparatively early stage of the bill surely there is time for it to be included in the bill <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that from my experiences in the standards authority there is indeed good reason for including some kind of means of keeping up with people who hold one-day sales <e> <s> what happens is that they advertise the sale they breach all kinds of trade descriptions act provisions and so forth and as soon as they are caught out they change their name and come back again <e> <s> there is a real matter to be looked into seriously and i suggest that it would not be difficult to draft a clause to cover this and to include it in the legislation at this stage rather than to wait until later because i think that the experience of all of us is that it takes very much longer to get a provision through even if it only requires an order or a regulation than if you have the existence of legislation before the house which concentrates peoples minds on taking the opportunity to get something put right that ought to be put right <e> <s> therefore i should like to support the noble lord lord underhill although i have not actually seen the representations from the consumer council on this matter <e>", "<cs> i share that view too <e>", "<cs> there is just one point here <e> <s> the firearm may be covered and may be in a sling <e> <s> surely that would not be an offence <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said about this <e> <s> i wonder whether he has gone quite far enough <e> <s> i wonder whether it would not be better to say the inhalation of or causing another person to inhale any chemical substance <e> <s> it might be worthwhile adding those words <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would agree that even taking his examples and the instances which he has given there are some cases where it would not be appropriate to make it an offence to make or use any slide upon ice or snow <e> <s> i wonder whether it would not be better to make it more precise and to say <e>", "<cs> may i add a very brief word to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> some of your lordships may remember that i was my noble friends immediate successor <e> <s> i found that he had done his very best to contain the contributions from the self-employed and i certainly did the same <e> <s> but one of the difficulties which has arisen is the enormous increase in contributions since that time <e> <s> if i remember rightly at that time the weekly contribution was below one shilling <e> <s> i think i raised it to one shilling <e> <s> it was something like ls <e> <s> d <e> <s> for the self-employed <e> <s> it is the enormous extent to which since then benefits have increased and therefore contributions have increased which has borne so much on the self-employed many of whom are on a very low rate of remuneration <e> <s> they do not make very much <e> <s> one tends to think of the self-employed as people with enormous businesses all over the world <e> <s> in fact many of them are among the low paid workers <e> <s> that is one point which has to be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend give me an indication as to what are the views of various local authorities on this question of districts and regions <e> <s> i can quite see that glasgow has a particular problem of its own but i would have thought that it would have been possible to make special provisions for at least one regional authority if not more <e> <s> i do not see why the notice should necessarily be given to the same tier in every case <e>", "<cs> i do not suppose that this would necessarily be the right place to deal with it in a bill of this description and especially in an exclusion clause but my experience is that there is a good deal of hard feeling about these ancient rules and regulations that apply to public transport undertakings <e> <s> i do not know whether it is the right time even to say this but it might at least be noted i should have thought that this was something that the consultative bodies attached to the various nationalised undertakings and where there are any such things the consumer bodies too at any rate someone should have a careful look at to see what is provided in the way of service for lost property on these various undertakings <e>", "<cs> is that really the answer <e> <s> my second thoughts about the matter while my noble friend was speaking were that he was talking about those articles which were claimed but what about all the articles which were not claimed <e> <s> one of the difficulties the police must face is the fact that something which is lost in a particular place does not necessarily go to the nearest police station it may be handed in at a totally different place <e> <s> one would like to know the total figures of articles claimed and what proportion are not claimed at all <e> <s> in the case of those which are not claimed the provision says that the chief constable shall take reasonable steps to ascertain the identity of the person <e>", "<cs> in this clause are local authorities subject to planning permission regarding where advertisements are displayed <e> <s> i should have thought that they were <e> <s> does this clause override the necessity for planning permission <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will give the noble lord lord fletcher any drafting assistance on this bill if he wishes it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if it would be convenient for the house and the noble earl if i referred now to my amendment which follows later on amendment no <e> <s> about a material change <e> <s> it arises in this way <e> <s> we start from the point from which the noble lord himself started <e> <s> his amendment deals with sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention was helpful and i am sorry if my noble friend does not find it helpful <e> <s> i do not intend to press the matter but shall wait to hear what the noble lord lord ross of marnock has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for what i think is a sound suggestion <e> <s> i was a little worried about one remark that my noble friend lord lyell made <e> <s> he said that he would not like the idea of objections being made on and i cannot remember what he said i think suspicion but at any rate without conviction <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see how that could happen because the purpose of notifying the weights and measures authority would be to enable it to make its recommendations reservations or objections publicly and it would have to do that <e> <s> i certainly agree that it would be quite wrong to let it do it privately <e> <s> yet this is what the government seem to be suggesting that it should consult privately and that that should then influence the granting of the licence <e> <s> i do not think that that is what the bill intended <e> <s> i am rather surprised that my noble friend said so <e>", "<cs> my lords and perhaps i may add when notice has been given to the public in which case of course the weights and measures authority and the regional authority would be treated simply as a member of the public in that regard <e> <s> i should have thought that this was a strange way of going about things <e> <s> i really think that my noble friend ought to look at this again if only to see whether some means should be given of encouraging the regional authorities and the weights and measures authorities to take an interest in these proceedings <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i said in my introductory remarks that although any application for a licence can be published if the local authority wishes it to be it does not have to be <e> <s> it is not a prescribed duty <e> <s> i entirely agree with that which makes the case greater <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he makes my case for me there <e> <s> that is something worth looking at <e> <s> i do not pretend that the drafting of this would be perfect in any case <e> <s> i rather agree that perhaps i went rather wild in bringing in all kinds of licences some of which are not applicable although one or two of those mentioned could be <e> <s> for example <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of seeking wider powers <e> <s> it is one of co-ordinating powers which exist <e> <s> if this does not appeal to my noble friend then all i can do is to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am myself in sympathy with the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> i think the house might well listen to him because he comes from a remote area though perhaps not one as remote as sutherland <e> <s> in trying to reach a decision on this i wonder whether my noble friend could indicate to us at what point he will discuss with the local authorities whether this or that district will have a taxi licensing system <e> <s> will it be before the bill goes to another place after the bill has become law or what <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question in clarification <e> <s> am i right in thinking that there are two phases in this that the first is to get the satellite in the air and to do some experimentation with it and the second to give the general service that is likely to emanate <e> <s> am i right in thinking that it will be possible to go ahead almost immediately with the launching plans but that it will still be many years before the satellite gets into a geostationary position <e> <s> in the meantime obviously there will be many difficult problems such as that which has just been raised which will have to be settled <e> <s> may i say that i hope that my noble friend will not be too precipitate and too definite in the other plans that are being laid as to the way in which the services are to be operated and charges to be made <e> <s> i do not see how they can be very definite because it is going to be difficult to know what the uptake will be of those who wish to incur the very considerable expenditure of getting an individual service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wondering whether there is a misprint in that the amendment should contain the word be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he would be good enough to deal with one point <e> <s> may i say that i find his arguments entirely convincing in this case and i hope that the amendment will not be pressed <e> <s> but what slightly worries me is when a procession is not a procession <e> <s> what exactly do we mean by a procession <e> <s> you may have a procession which is intended entirely for demonstration purposes <e> <s> you may have a procession which is a means of controlling progress from one place to another <e> <s> indeed according to some of the remarks that have been made there is some doubt about whether the course of getting to a football match and moving along several roads simultaneously to one destination is a procession or a series of processions <e> <s> or what is it <e> <s> i am not sure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend just one question <e> <s> in the example that he gave it seemed to me that the words without lawful excuse were qualifying <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> this is a problem which has come my way in the past mainly through the control of advertising <e> <s> however this is not a question of the control of advertising <e> <s> it works in this way the operator of the occasional sale has to give notice in some way or another <e> <s> he can do this by advertising in newspapers or by distributing leaflets <e> <s> the experience that i had was that the dishonest traders were prone to advertise at the very last moment so that the newspaper had no opportunity of checking the advertisement or the traders distributed the notices of the occasional sale at the very last moment <e>", "<cs> with great respect i fail to see how it is unfair to anybody <e> <s> how is the honest trader in any way disadvantaged by the trading standards authorities being informed of the time when he will appear in a particular town and occupy premises there <e> <s> i cannot see any reason at all why that should not be done <e> <s> so far as honest traders are concerned they generally go back again and again to the same premises quite regularly <e> <s> they will be well-known and very likely the weights and measures inspectors will not bother to visit them <e> <s> but what one is trying to get at is the less reputable traders to make certain that some kind of notice at any rate of their intention to have an occasional sale is notified to the local weights and measures authorities so that they can protect the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not put down my name to speak but there is one matter to which i should like to refer and which i was confident would be referred to in the course of the debate <e> <s> i should like to make brief mention of it but before i do so i might say that it would seem almost appropriate that as i am the only person present today apart from one other who has not made a speech i should say a word at this stage <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mishcon very greatly on the manner in which he has introduced this bill <e> <s> he always does things so suavely and acceptably that he has added lustre to what already was a very promising bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in supporting the amendment <e> <s> i believe that there are two important aspects which i hope my noble friend will be able to clarify <e> <s> first so far as scotland is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the incidents that were cited by the noble lord opposite were incidents during the past seven years in which plastic bullets had been used <e>", "<cs> my lords the tone of this debate so far has been extremely interesting and provocative of thought but not particularly of debate <e> <s> i do not myself propose to debate the matters that have been raised today because a miscellaneous provisions bill of this kind is essentially one that covers provisions i was going to say a hotch-potch which are loosely related and not closely connected <e>", "<cs> my lords there was oral evidence <e>", "<cs> yes there was <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and the noble lord lord mishcon for the way in which they have dealt with this amendment <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon because i realise that this is an embarrassment to him <e> <s> i entirely accept what he says that at this time of the year particularly whenever a private members bill has come from another place and is amended here it places in jeopardy the possibility of the bill becoming an act <e> <s> i am fully conscious of that <e> <s> i do not know whether i need to apologise for taking up the time of the committee because this is an important matter that deserves to be studied <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support what has been said by both of the speakers so far <e> <s> what is left in doubt in the bill as it stands is the date upon which part ii will be brought into operation <e> <s> i understood my noble friend the secretary of state to have indicated at an earlier stage that in the interval he was going to make inquiries as to how far it will be possible to exempt certain forms of activities before the bill was brought into operation in scotland <e> <s> could not this time be used for the scottish law commission to inquire into the matter and even for legislation to be carried through <e> <s> is it too tight a programme <e> <s> we just do not know how long it will be before the england and wales bill will be brought into operation in respect of part ii <e> <s> however i emphasise and strongly support the proposition that the same kind of provisions should be provided for scotland and at the same time if at all possible as for england <e> <s> perhaps my noble and learned friend the lord advocate could deal with that point <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is an old song which starts <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be agreed on both sides of the house to disagree with our own sides <e> <s> i would like to thank my noble friend lord mansfield for his reply and i recognise that in the circumstances possibly he has gone as far as he can <e> <s> i believe that the institute of trading standards authorities and its scottish counterpart will probably take advantage of his offer <e> <s> i find it difficult to answer some of the points which have been made without reopening the whole debate and i am quite certain that your lordships would not wish me to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> he referred to a scotsman being transferred back to scotland and i understood him to say that that was at the convicted persons request <e> <s> in other words a person could not be transferred back to his country of origin except at his own request <e> <s> does the same apply under the draft convention <e> <s> it seems to me a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add to what the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand how this will work <e> <s> let us take for example the case of an english tourist going to scotland who commits a road offence there <e> <s> let us say that he does not have his licence on him <e> <s> what will happen in that case <e> <s> subsection is totally disapplied here <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment to say that in my experience it is common when new legislation is introduced to issue guidance but i have heard local authorities and other authorities again and again complaining about pages and pages of guidelines which are often not very welcome and often not very closely regarded <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a small practical question <e> <s> if a taxi is hired by telephone that is not in a public place and it can easily be hired by telephone and noble lords must have done it themselves from time to time does it become a hired car <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate my noble friend on the success that has been achieved especially bearing in mind the existence of the prophets of doom so far as the imminent breakdown of gatt is concerned <e> <s> would he go a little further in the answer he has just given and perhaps tell us what the composition of the personnel engaging in these studies is to be <e> <s> will the studies be carried out by the secretariat of gatt or will they be conducted by special bodies to be appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend appreciate that the whole house entirely agrees with him in saying that it is the turn of our eec competitors to make sacrifices <e> <s> what steps can the government take to ensure that they do so <e> <s> can the commission require them to do so <e> <s> can representations be made to the commission to ensure that it takes steps <e> <s> because surely it is the responsibility of the commission to ensure fair trading in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend two simple questions <e> <s> first while the ministerial study is taking place will records be kept of what the cinemas are showing <e> <s> will each cinema have to show how many british films it shows how many american films it shows and how many films from other countries it shows <e> <s> secondly what exactly is meant by a british film <e> <s> i am afraid i am a little out of date because it is some years since i have had to deal with the subject but there were co-production agreements <e> <s> does a film which is produced in conjunction with another country say france or italy rank as a british film for the purposes of the records kept or are records to be kept separately for different countries <e> <s> it would certainly make the planning and consideration of the whole future of the film industry very much easier from the governmental point of view if records were to be kept and if necessary slightly amended to make them more meaningful <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could inject one idea here <e> <s> i am quite certain that my noble friend will have some reason for departing from the normal practice of having an annual report and we shall look forward to hearing it <e> <s> however there is the point that reports from year to year by the same body very often vary in extent content and the rest <e> <s> there is no necessity that the whole of the ground should be covered every year <e> <s> one reason for having an annual report especially in a highly experimental field such as this is that you can never tell what will happen or what will crop up in any year <e> <s> surely it is a good thing that you should not miss a year in which many important things are happening in which developments are taking place or matters of some notoriety have arisen <e> <s> i think that this might be a good reason for keeping open the usual position of having an annual report on the understanding that it will not be enormously detailed every year <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say that i may not have expressed myself with complete clarity but that is not what i suggested <e> <s> i was not suggesting that things should be missed out <e> <s> i was just saying that every detail should not be spelt out and there should not be complete elaboration of normal continuing almost routine matters but when there is a matter of some importance arising then that should be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords the draftsmen come in for a certain amount of criticism from time to time <e> <s> i rise only to say that i think this is an extremely neat bit of drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if it will not get over my noble friends difficulty if instead of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend does not like the forward as being too neutral then he could take the word transmit which makes it quite clear that there is a different connotation altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question or two on this <e> <s> following what my noble friend lord campbell of croy has said is it not the case that there are mentally disordered people who for the most part of their time behave normally live normal lives but who from time to time have sudden unpredictable outbursts where they are a danger first to themselves and secondly to others who are near them and also if they get outside to the public at large <e> <s> then is it not the case that most mental institutions have accommodation if i may put it that way all ready to deal with these cases where persons will not be allowed to harm themselves and neither will they be allowed to harm other people <e> <s> this is something which is prepared already <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend one question-whether the definition in subsection excludes manual as well as automatically recorded data <e>", "<cs> i think i heard my noble friend aright to say that the information provided to the registrar would be in general terms <e> <s> does that mean that the requirement to supply the sources will be in general terms or do the actual sources have to be given <e> <s> it would be commercially totally inappropriate to give the actual sources in certain cases <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might pursue that by asking my noble friend whether that means he would be prepared to listen to an argument despite the clause with which we have just been dealing that information would be commercially damaging if the applicant were required to provide it to the registrar because the penalties for not providing the information are severe <e>", "<cs> would not the registrar have already given the contravener an opportunity to rectify the contravention under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most amazingly interesting debate and it is a great pity that more members of your lordships house have not been present <e> <s> it is not i am sure the fault of the noble lord lord harris that we are having the debate on a friday rather than on another day when we could have attracted a larger attendance but it points to the fact that if there is a case at all for the bill then it ought to be further examined and i trust that if the bill receives a second reading today as i hope it will it will be fully examined <e> <s> if the government find it quite impossible to support the idea of the bill being referred to a select committee with all the advantages that that would provide of really looking into the question of the representation at district council level then i hope that a day will be appointed for consideration in this house when there would be a large attendance and when we could really go into the questions about which doubt has been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many wages councils if any have been abolished in the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could intervene because i have looked at amendment no <e> <s> and it seems to me that the function of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend what really is the status of this particular subsection <e> <s> it is perhaps a little surprising to find the subsection in this form in a bill of this kind <e> <s> i have no doubt that consultations have been taking place and i take it that perhaps those consultations have not yet been completed <e> <s> but to find a subsection subject to affirmative procedure order is at least surprising <e> <s> i wonder whether the government intended that it should be rather consultative at present with perhaps the possibility of reaching a decision as regards the final form before parliament passes this measure <e> <s> what do the government really intend here <e> <s> is it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord opposite and to my noble friend beside me here for their courteous rejoinders <e> <s> may i just say again before withdrawing my amendment that there is a great difference between my amendment and subsections and in that my amendment does not give an opportunity to the data subjects to object not that they will necessarily take their opportunity <e> <s> but this is a very big one and it is essential to the purpose that i have in mind in proposing my amendment <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to bear that in mind <e> <s> again i think him for the way in which he has responded and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords so that we can get the comparison and indeed the problem into perspective can my noble friend say what are the school leaving ages in france and germany <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend replies may i say that i find myself in great sympathy with what the noble lord lord hughes has said <e> <s> he said specifically that this was just one of the matters that would have to be considered <e> <s> would not another matter be the consideration of these people on the list if i may put it that way so far as conciliation is concerned <e> <s> it might also be a useful role for them to play and of course this would no doubt add to the costs <e> <s> but if we are seeking justice and what one might almost call social justice and also seeking to maintain i was going to say the sanctity of marriage this would be an important aspect of what those on the list might be asked to do would it not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord now says specific duties <e> <s> i am a total layman in this <e> <s> can he say that whereas in this case a general duty is laid and all these various general duties in any particular case that would mean that the registrar would be under a duty to carry that out <e> <s> is that what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for those two explanations of two aspects in this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that this will help others to understand what is really involved here <e> <s> i do not think that i could possibly agree with my noble friend lord swinfen in regard to direct mail <e> <s> i am advised that this is being done already but at great cost and with great difficulty <e> <s> the object of the technology behind this bill at any rate is to enable these things to economise resources and not to have to spend so much money in preparing the lists <e> <s> but i believe that they do in fact exist at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that we cannot carry the matter any further tonight because my noble friend is obviously not in a position to accept the amendment now <e> <s> however i hope very much that it will be carried further in another place <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer one other comment on this <e> <s> i do not know exactly whether it would be in any way conclusive <e> <s> my noble friend has already referred to the fact that there was a draft of the guidelines circulated on i think nd november <e> <s> this reply to a question on th march is in fact pretty near a redraft of the same guidelines <e> <s> it seems to me that this puts an entirely fresh complexion on the whole thing <e> <s> i would also suggest with great diffidence to your lordships that we would in this particular case have a very much tidier debate if clause were recommitted at this time <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies perhaps i might make one or two remarks <e> <s> first we are extremely grateful to my noble friend lord skelmersdale for having arranged for the question to be answered on th march as my noble friend lord sandford said <e> <s> i do not mean that we are grateful for that date but that we are grateful for his having done so <e> <s> one thing has stood out very much from the very able speech of my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> it was the stress that he laid on including in the bill the essential points that are now proposed to be included in the guidelines <e> <s> of course it is not unknown for provision for guidelines to be made in bills but what is i think desirable is to get what is really essential into the bill when it is at all possible rather than leave it to guidelines <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend forgive me <e> <s> it seemed to me reading over the previous proceedings at committee stage that we were always in danger of confusing a main committee with the divisional committees which i understood are proposed in the present draft guidelines <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> may i put a further question about membership of the consumer consultative committees <e> <s> following what the noble baroness lady serota has said would it not be normal for complaints from the public to be made to a member of the consultative committee <e> <s> i am not quite certain what my noble friend replied to that but i should have thought that this was the normal procedure just as one makes a complaint to a member of a local authority or in the case of parliamentary complaints to a member of parliament <e>", "<cs> i understand that <e> <s> would my noble friend between now and the report stage look at what that will mean in terms of the number of members of the consumer consultative committees per division <e> <s> i ask that because it looks as though some of these divisions will have very large numbers <e>", "<cs> if i recall correctly we dealt a short time ago with the data protection bill which provided for all three ways of doing this by affirmative resolution by negative resolution or by laying an order before parliament <e> <s> i did not at that time understand that that meant simply tucking it away in the proceedings <e> <s> the main point is to get a complete document before your lordships <e> <s> i do not think you can rely on all members of parliament picking up fairly obscure references in the proceedings of the orders of the day <e> <s> my intention was that the very least that would happen would be that the document was in a complete form laid somewhere or another and i would prefer it to be laid before members of parliament rather than simply in the library <e>", "<cs> may i clarify a little further <e> <s> the mere fact of introducing an order on a negative basis does not ensure that there is any discussion <e> <s> it occurs only if somebody objects to the order <e> <s> the affirmative resolution is different because it gives a much stronger possibility of automatic discussion on request <e> <s> what i am wanting to ensure is that there can be the possibility of a debate if anybody wants it <e> <s> it seems almost certain that people will want it and that can be done on the basis of an order that is laid before parliament because it is there and anyone can ask for a debate on it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that he has dealt with this amendment very fairly and competently <e> <s> he knows that we are all at one in the committee about getting a sensible way of making the house aware not only of the existence of the document but of the document itself <e> <s> that is what we aim to achieve and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one question on this clause <e> <s> i doubt whether many of your lordships will have gleaned very much from reading this clause <e> <s> also i should like to know how it is that the scottish office i take it have decided on this particular formula <e> <s> at present it is unlawful except with the consent of the secretary of state given after consultation with the two scottish boards for any body or person to establish in the district of either of the two boards a new private generating station operated by water power and having plant exceeding as it is at the present time kw or to extend any existing private station so operated in that district by the installation of plant with a rating exceeding kw <e> <s> we have been talking in terms of mw and goodness knows what and the clause is concerned with raising the present limit of kw for hydro-electric stations to megawatt <e> <s> anything over mw would require the permission that is at present required under the electricity scotland act for anything over kw <e> <s> i think that i have correctly stated the position <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would also agree to discuss this particular amendment in relation to its impact on the highlands of scotland <e> <s> there must be several areas in the highlands of scotland where there is no form of distribution system <e> <s> if a private system on a local authority basis were to be established or if it were to be a highlands and islands development board system or a private enterprise system it would need in order to be effective to have its own local distribution service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to my noble friend <e> <s> i dare say that he put his amendment down before he had seen mine <e> <s> i think that we have reached the right solution <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend on the dexterity with which he dealt with the last amendment <e> <s> obviously it was quite impossible for him to say what progress had been made in the discussions for probably there have not been any further discussions since the last time we debated this matter <e> <s> certainly he has made it possible <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that in this particular case there is no absolutely exact parallel which we could follow <e> <s> we have to judge it on the composition of the bodies which could help and not seek to force a precedent which is not really a precedent <e> <s> it seems to me that the obvious course for an individual in a particular part of the country to take is to go to his local representative on the consultative council <e> <s> there are local representatives in all parts of the country <e> <s> the local representative on the consultative council will have experience of water matters <e> <s> it seems to me that the right course to take is to allow him to pass the complaint to the water authority <e> <s> several complaints in the locality may be involved <e> <s> these complaints should be discussed by the consultative council before they approach the water authority <e> <s> the water authority can then consider the matter and reply yea or nay <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene again to make my point clear <e> <s> we are not dealing here with local authorities <e> <s> in any case there will have to be an amendment to the act and we can make what amendments are the most appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am following what the noble lord is saying with great care <e> <s> however would he not agree that the principal obstacle to any kind of settlement is the probability as things are that if the greek cypriots obtained complete domination over the island to the extent that they could hold a plebiscite and determine to join greece this would cause very great trouble in the future <e> <s> indeed it is precisely against this possibility that the turks have reacted so strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is making a very good case <e> <s> however i did not say that a solution is impossible <e> <s> i said that there is a high possibility that if what i said happened namely that the greeks obtained entire control over the island it would sow the seeds of trouble <e> <s> it is that possibility which weighs most strongly with the turks <e>", "<cs> my lords will consideration be given in this conference to distinguishing between the very poor countries and the newly industrialised countries where the problems are quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord rugby will forgive me what does he mean by asset stripping in this sense <e> <s> does he mean that part of the assets are disposed of <e> <s> if that is so to whom are they disposed <e> <s> does he mean that they are being disposed to farmers to tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one small reservation about this <e> <s> can the new amendment be treated with a certain amount of latitude <e> <s> it is in my recollection that occasionally a paving amendment may lead even to a series of schedules <e> <s> it would be rather ridiculous if whole schedules were to be printed immediately after the first amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the brief time i have at my disposal i should like to start by congratulating the noble lord lord spens for introducing this debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble viscount lord tonypandy for the wonderful speech that he has given to us today <e> <s> we all feel it was a great privilege to have heard it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain whether i was aware that the expenses of the civil administration were paid by turkey <e> <s> i am not at all certain whether turkey will go on carrying that liability <e> <s> i did know that the turkish troops there are paid for by turkey <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to intervene but realised that the noble lord had said turkish cypriots <e> <s> i beg his pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question on the cyprus issue <e> <s> my noble friend referred to an action group that had been set up in that connection <e> <s> i doubt if he is in a position today to give them to us but i would ask him to give the house details of that action group at an early opportunity as it is a matter of great importance <e> <s> in particular it will be important for the action group to find out at first hand for themselves what are the grievances of the turkish cypriots which have led to the action that has been taken by them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will invite his noble friend to take steps to cross-check with the metropolitan county councils on the expectation that he has expressed that there would be no extra cost <e> <s> is he aware that according to information that i have received an estimate has been made by at least one of the metropolitan county councils that the cost would be doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express gratification that the noble lord lord mcintosh is in consonance with this order if that is the right expression <e> <s> i personally am but i should like to ask one or two questions <e> <s> first may i congratulate my noble friend on the clarity of what he has said <e> <s> this is a very complicated subject and i hope i do not seem in any way to be diminishing my appreciation of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend turns away from the point which i raised may i ask him one other question which i omitted to put <e> <s> in the case of section orders why was it that the government first intended to increase the limit to and then proceeded to double it to <e> <s> it would be useful to know why this was done <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will forgive me for interrupting him <e> <s> while expressing condolences for his temporary disability he would marginally improve his audibility if he placed himself opposite one of the amplifiers <e>", "<cs> my lords are these resolutions mandatory in any way <e> <s> are they binding <e>", "<cs> i can quite understand the rational attempt to draw together a number of means by which the <e>", "<cs> may we go back to the question again <e> <s> i think i heard the lord chairman determine that the contents had it <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if at the same time my noble and learned friend could say what their abbreviated name is to be <e> <s> will some of the a roads be included <e>", "<cs> i think i have understood that but would it not be possible to take this opportunity to bring in something that the public could understand without an explanation as to what is an m road that is not a special road <e> <s> one does come across examples of where an m road ceases to be an m road and it is not quite clear what happens then and what the difference is whether a cyclist can use it or not <e> <s> i know that there are general notices to indicate whether cyclists or motor-cyclists can use the roads but have we not gone long enough now to have a special classification for a special road that is not a motorway <e>", "<cs> will the secretary of state automatically be liable to maintain it if it is a principal road or who will <e>", "<cs> i wish to express my satisfaction with that decision which i am sure is the right one <e> <s> i am sure that this is a local matter <e>", "<cs> i wish to make two observations on what the noble lord lord hughes says <e> <s> if guidance were given by the secretary of state how easy or difficult would it be for the sheriff to interpret that guidance <e> <s> how would he find out from other areas what the norm was <e> <s> would it make sense for the secretary of state in a matter of this kind to consult the convention and get a consensus <e> <s> i should have thought <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the lord advocate is absolutely right in leaving room to alter the camber <e>", "<cs> i could not help thinking when the noble lord opposite was arguing this case and kept leaving out the words altering the level of the public road that that is not the same as altering the road <e> <s> altering the road would go very much further than that <e> <s> but in spite of what i said earlier i would strongly support what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said <e>", "<cs> they have no duty unless they themselves have constructed or laid the roads <e>", "<cs> there is another reference under which they would have a duty even though they had not laid or constructed the road <e>", "<cs> there are certain respects in which i agree very much with what the noble lord opposite said <e> <s> however there is one aspect which must always be kept prominently on peoples minds when they are planning road signs and that is prompt advance information so that people will not stop in the middle of the road and start looking for their destination <e> <s> it is very difficult for people constructing roads and road signs and who know the district and so on to put themselves into the minds of people who do not know where they are but who are trying to get to their destination <e> <s> i put some stress on that aspect <e> <s> it is particularly important when one is driving on fairly poor roads that is poor in comparison with others <e> <s> road surfaces have improved greatly in recent times and that has meant that vehicles go faster <e>", "<cs> may i interject one point here <e> <s> is it quite fair when admittedly the licensee has done pretty well and has not put a foot wrong to allow someone else to come along without being able to give any proof whatever and say i can do better than that and merely on argument convince the authority that it would be worthwhile trying him <e> <s> i am not sure that is quite fair <e> <s> i wonder whether there is not some means of getting over that difficulty <e> <s> for example would it not be fair to allow the authority to put to the licensee yes you have done pretty well but that does not mean you have been perfect <e> <s> we should like to discuss with you ways in which you could improve your performance and compare that with what the new applicant says he could do <e> <s> then they could make a decision <e> <s> they could say on the basis of what you have done we can find no fault in that but we have seen an application from somebody else and it looks to us as though it could make improvements on what you have been doing <e> <s> but it may not do so the authority may prove to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to believe that some of us feel some doubt about this but at the same time we realise that if there was a particular reason for taking this decision at this moment and i do not say whether there was or there was not it would not have been appropriate for us in the nature of security circumstances to demand to be told what that reason was <e> <s> it seems to me quite obvious that in this field when you have to take a decision of this kind you do not reveal the reason at the time for taking that decision <e> <s> i find this consideration completely overriding and i hope that noble lords will agree with me in this case <e>", "<cs> i believe that skips are not always used by their owners but are let out to others from time to time <e> <s> therefore would it not be the person operating the skip who would require permission from the roads authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask whether the word anything in line would include an animal <e> <s> for example an animal that is tied up might cause a child on a bicycle to swerve into a line of traffic <e>", "<cs> the first line says <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to say whether the ratios vary greatly in different parts of the country and in particular in scotland wales and england <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to intervene in a debate in which so many have spoken so brilliantly of educational issues on a national scale <e> <s> my purpose is a narrow one to refer to a small section to which i would apply the description vulnerable used by the noble lord lord flowers in his wonderful speech <e> <s> the university grants committee has the unenviable job of cutting out dead wood from time to time and i would not dissent from the suggestion of the noble lord lord annan that the committee should tell an institution in question that its grant will be put at risk unless some cut specified by the committee is imposed <e> <s> i hope that i have understood the noble lord correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have my name on the speakers list either but perhaps i may say a few words before my noble and learned friend the lord advocate replies <e> <s> when we are making what are really very substantial and radical changes to the law it is perhaps appropriate to see what we are changing the law from <e> <s> i wonder how many people are aware of the differences in the law that exist between england and scotland at the present <e>", "<cs> my lords that is so but i started in scotland and started with some presumptions as to what the law was there <e> <s> i am quite certain that i was not aware of what the law was then <e> <s> i think that it would be appropriate if my noble and learned friend could indicate perhaps even in passing how people regard the law in scotland what the assumptions are how much is taken for granted let us say in scotland at the present time where changes have to be made and what effect they will have <e> <s> it seems to me that the effect of the bill has been very lucidly described as to what it is going to be but less emphasis has been placed on the changes that are being made <e> <s> i think that that is important if only to mark the historic changes that are being made and to make clear the changes in custom as well as in law that we are dealing with in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question which has been puzzling me for quite a time <e> <s> what is the future of these arrangements expected to be <e> <s> if a person has been a secure tenant for two years he will be able to buy his house and will obtain the benefit of the reductions specified in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord opposite and i think that my noble friend is to be complimented on a very satisfactory answer but it inevitably does not answer all the questions <e> <s> in fact it does not answer the particular examples as i understand it that the noble lord lord ross gave <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i should like to ask who exactly is covered by the provision and what liabilities remain <e> <s> there is a reference to the commissioners of northern lighthouses <e> <s> have they not always had houses for those people they employ <e> <s> do they in fact have a duty to provide retirement houses for those people they have employed and is it not the same with the other cases mentioned <e> <s> what is the justification for allowing those who for the purposes of their work are in tied houses to occupy them indefinitely <e> <s> this problem exists in so many walks of life not least for example in the church <e>", "<cs> or an under-secretary my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i explain briefly how i venture to view this problem <e> <s> here we have a right given to purchase a house a qualified right qualified by the public need <e> <s> if in the opinion of the local authority there is a need for the house to remain in public ownership so that it may be occupied by a school teacher or whatever that is a qualification on the main right <e> <s> the problem then becomes the difference between the rights of the individual and the rights of the public of the community which needs a teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords i must concede that that is a plausible argument but the fact remains that there is a difference of interest here to be solved by a third party why not the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we ought not to be having a dialogue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that these are not the same case <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one observation on this matter <e> <s> i am less qualified than many people here to make it but i am sure most of us would agree that in fact it was the intention to review the rating system <e> <s> as i understand it the only reason for not doing so now is that there are more important things to do than to change the rating system <e> <s> i simply want to ask my noble friend whether even though there is no immediate prospect of changing the rating system it would not be a good thing to look at it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> is he quite certain about that <e> <s> from my experience of looking at the amendments that come up from another place it seems to me that in some cases they disagree without assigning any reason the reason generally being that they have decided to ignore our amendment because it is not a matter upon which they think that we are entitled to comment <e>", "<cs> surely my recollection is correct <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords recollection conforms with mine <e> <s> one way of dealing with an order with which you disagree at least on one respect is to get the government to withdraw it and then reintroduce it <e> <s> surely that is possible and that is perfectly democratic <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that it is a general rule regarded by all the district valuers that something new is to be assessed at six times the amount of something old <e> <s> when does the new become old <e> <s> does the amount at which it has been assessed originally stick until somebody appeals against it <e>", "<cs> everywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept from this side of the house that we are very glad indeed that special consideration is being given to scottish problems <e> <s> there was some danger in the statement yesterday and i do not lay any blame whatever on my noble friend who repeated the statement that the needs of scotland were going to be settled at the same time as and in identical terms to the needs of england <e> <s> that has never been so and i hope that it never will be so especially as regards education where the problems are so different <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will take comfort from the way in which this statement has been received today <e> <s> he has made it quite clear that scottish problems are going to be tackled in a way that meets the needs of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we have covered an immense field this afternoon since this debate started <e> <s> i want to confine myself to one main subject <e> <s> i start by declaring an interest and let me add like the noble lord lord mcgregor not a financial interest <e> <s> in one way or another i have been involved in consumer protection and trading standards matters for some years starting in on weights and measures at the board of trade <e> <s> since june i have been president of the institute of trading standards administration <e> <s> that is a professional body from which local authorities recruit the officers to man their departments commonly called consumer protection or trading standards services and that is what i am going to talk about for a few minutes <e>", "<cs> if it is convenient for the committee i should like to speak now to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> may i simply say thank you to my noble friend for accepting these amendments and thank members on both sides who have supported what i have had to say <e> <s> one or two did not support but the general feeling of the committee was in favour of the tenor of the amendments <e> <s> may i also say thank you very much to the noble baroness opposite who saved me quite a bit of speaking by covering most of the points that i had in mind <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> in that case i shall not move the amendment <e> <s> but i reserve the right to come back at a subsequent stage <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for the way in which he has carried out his undertakings and i entirely endorse what he has said <e> <s> i do not think that i need go into these matters in any detail <e> <s> the only one i should like to refer to relates to the staff and not breaking up the teams <e> <s> this is a very important aspect and was emphasised by the committee under the chairmanship of the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> it would be very sad if the personnel if i may use that nasty word involved who have done so much in the past years to improve the handling of trading standards in the metropolitan areas were to be broken up <e> <s> it would be very bad indeed for the trading standards services and all they do both for export and inside this country itself <e> <s> it would be very bad indeed and there would undoubtedly be at any rate in an interim period a decline in standards if that were done <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a short paragraph to what has been said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to clarify this for me <e> <s> i am not clear whether what we have been talking about here includes those bodies which come under the successor body to the metropolitan counties <e> <s> some of these may consist of technical services or may contain technical services <e> <s> i was a little worried about what my noble friend said on th june at col of the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend one or two questions <e> <s> first i think i am right in saying that in the other place it was suggested that the maximum sum for small claims should be set between and <e> <s> am i to understand that the order will go into quite a considerable amount of detail as to how it is determined where the sum is going to lie in any particular case <e> <s> may i suggest to my noble and learned friend that seems to be rather small <e> <s> i have had representations from the scottish consumer council which is of the opinion that in many cases would not be enough <e> <s> i have been given some examples where it would indeed be scanty <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble and learned friend can expand on that <e>"]
