consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords if the russians are represented at the next geneva conference on disarmament could they be asked whether their invasion of afghanistan is one of their contributions

the substance and content of education not a single word has been said <e> <s> one might assume that that is because those who are present are incapable of discussing the subject although many of them from their contributions to which i have listened with my usual interest in such matters are if not professors or philosophers at any rate headmasters or ex-headmasters or ex-headmistresses and the like who are assumed to have a thorough-going knowledge about education <e>", "<cs> it is not the first time that i have been informed that i am in the wrong place in fact when i came here first that

expect me to be otherwise but perhaps i could be informed what we are actually discussing <e> <s> if we happen to be discussing anything in the nature of transfer of a pupil <e> <s> from one school to another then i want to know what are to be the criteria i have got it at last which will justify the transformation <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is a misunderstanding that derives not so much

rubbish <e> <s> i do not want that to be said of what has been happening here but if it goes on as it has been i may be forced to say it <e>", "<cs> earlier i ventured in my ignorance of the subject to ask when were we going to explain what we meant by education <e> <s> i was told i was addressing your lordships in the wrong place so i was told by my noble friend lord davies of leek <e> <s> that was due to my ignorance <e>", "<cs> yes i am quite sure all my friends the very few i have are very anxious to render the assistance i am very much in need ofotherwise i do not know how i should manage to survive at all <e> <s> however so far i have learned nothing about the substance and content of education <e> <s> i am not going to explain my view about it because this is not the appropriate occasion but at last i have discovered that in the opinion of two or three members of your lordships committee education of the higher quality should be specialised and explicitly directed towards certain qualifications which would enable a student to become an accountant or maybe a lawyer or a doctor or something of that sort <e> <s> well i do not know what might have happened when i was quite <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the foreign secretary for that answer may i ask him whether he is aware that one of the primary objectives of the plo is to continue the war against the

that it is a fact of life <e> <s> on the other hand i object to its primary objective <e> <s> i am not at all satisfied that either the foreign secretary in his recent declaration about the middle east or the attitude of some members of the eec arc being satisfactory in the sense of recognising definitely and emphatically and without any qualifications the right of the state of israel to exist

damaging and deplorable is acceptable as long as we escape from it <e> <s> do not the recruiting figures indicate that the programme far from being deplorable was historical and factual and is unlikely to do any damage and that the conditions now prevailing in her majestys forces are on the whole satisfactory compared with what they have been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount who seems very adequately versed in these matters why he maintains that this is not a matter for the government <e> <s> what is the philosophic economic ethical artistic or aesthetic

announcement about home and civil defence whereas now we are told that we have to wait until after easter <e> <s> what is the cause of the delay <e> <s> do the government realise that this is a matter

the case or on prejudice of some kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord this question is he aware that it is not so essential to declare a specific date for any further action

deployment of destructive weapons is just a lot of phantasy <e> <s> the question i want to ask the noble lord and which i think is most important i say that although no doubt there are other important

military connotation <e> <s> if so why the delay in placing the orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he explain why when months ago there was a great deal of excitement and indeed high expectation of sales to the chinese peoples republic

detailed consideration <e> <s> is he aware that when discussing defence matters and in particular the defence <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble earl the acting leader of the house will agree

always has been <e> <s> even <e>", "<cs> my lords if we decide not to proceed with the development of chemical weapons is there any indication that the soviet union would follow suit <e> <s> further can the noble lord say whether the subject has been dealt with by the nato countries either collectively or individually and with what result <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while recognisant of the problems associated with the subject of standardisation i wonder whether this would not be a useful opportunity when we are proposing either the construction of a new battle tank or

explain why he has referred in his statement to the underlying causes <e> <s> i notice that the members of the opposition have referred to the underlying causes but seem to be reluctant to go further than make reference to them when everybody in your lordships house is aware that those underlying causes are first of all unemployment secondly social conditions thirdly the abominable housing

the police <e> <s> although we call upon the police to suppress disorder whenever it is possible to do so it is a matter for the government to delve deeply into this issue of underlying causes <e> <s>

any aspect of government policy detect any real effort to eradicate these problems <e>", "<cs> i had the good fortune this afternoon of listening to several of my colleagues from the front bench arguing in support of the retention of the very useful and desirable functions of the neb <e> <s> all of them argued with great force and ability against as they alleged the emasculation of the neb

question why was it necessary to allow the other questions to go on at great length when a very important issue was being raised and we are not allowed to ask questions about it <e>", "<cs> my lords could we have an assurance from the noble lord that he is really interested in what is going to happen in the year or is he not feeling very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening in

circumstances as efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords a few years ago as has already been mentioned at a time of what might be regarded as comparative peace and when any reference to defence was regarded if not with indifference at any rate with a lack of enthusiasm i conceived the notion and gained the support of other members of your lordships house of engaging in a study of the strategy of defence

minister for having furnished me with some information on this very important topic <e> <s> i realise that it may have been difficult to furnish accurate statistics but is he aware that as a result of inquiries i have made particularly in the areas of st marylebone and regents park and indeed in other parts of the west end of london landlords have not had any difficulty at all in obtaining the highest rents in these regulated tenancy habitations because they are occupied by iranians asians jamaicans and those who are quite capable of paying the highest rent that is demanded even if it does not come out of their own pockets <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a short supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have not the faintest idea how much it is going to cost to

demand for a reduction in the number of civil servants without any logical reason for it being offered <e> <s> there has been almost a passion for cutting down <e> <s> he is aware no doubt that in the

branch lines only to discover that it adversely affected the people who wanted to use transport in the ordinary fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords while applauding the efforts of the foreign secretary in this connection may i ask whether he really believes that in view of the reluctance of some of the government representatives at the conference and their attitude the sanctions are likely to prove effective <e> <s> further was there any discussion whether public or private on the subject of the russian invasion of afghanistan and can he say what was the reason for the hurried departure of president giscard destaing to meet mr brezhnev <e> <s> was it for the purpose of asking not only his consent on the subject of sanctions against iran but also about their attitude on afghanistan <e>",

reasonable standard of conditions <e> <s> can the noble lord clear up that point <e>", "<cs> so far i have endeavoured to refrain from excessive intervention in the debates although there have been occasions when i was sorely tempted but this particular amendment has a profound interest for me <e> <s> in fact i am an interested party not as a landlord but as a tenant <e> <s> i have observed in

really concerns one in a matter of this sort is whether as a result of reorganisation and reorganisation no doubt is essential people are going to have their services dispensed with <e> <s> i think that question ought to be answered because i am bound to say that if it is not answered satisfactorily although it is not my business i am not on the front bench and do not decide matters of this sort

that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the position is deplorable and most unsatisfactory <e> <s> that it would appear that the soviet union could now invade almost any part of the globe without any resistance from the allied nations even the united states of america and certainly the united kingdom <e> <s> that we are now in a position where we cannot act diplomatically because there is no hope of success in that connection <e> <s> that we are apparently unable to mobilise our forces in order to warn the soviet union that if they persist in behaviour of this character this can only lead to another conflagration and that we are not prepared to allow them to misbehave in this fashion because in the long run it would mean that the civilised nations of the world would have to surrender <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to ask this further question will the foreign secretary appreciate now that there are some of us who feel i cannot speak for everybody and certainly i have no right <e>", "<cs> be it on a principle which is not worth two pennyworth of gin <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express on opinion <e> <s> is the noble minister aware that if i thought there was any possibility of coining to some arrangement with the soviet union either in the future proposed salt talks or in any kind of negotiations that might be suggested i would offer opposition to the governments propositions except that i would advocate as i have done frequently the provision of adequate conventional weapons <e> <s> and i hope that nothing the government propose in connection with nuclear weapons will prevent our providing adequate conventional equipment and weapons for our conventional forces <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether if we dismiss the details

upon stripping the assets of british rail <e> <s> generally speaking they are trying to dispose of the principle of nationalisation <e> <s> however they have not yet decided to denationalise the coal mining industry <e> <s> i wonder whether that is a favour accorded to me because i piloted the bill through the house of commons and through your lordships house <e> <s> so far the government have not attacked the principle of the nationalisation of the mining industry <e> <s> when are they going to attack it <e> <s> when are they going to attack and confront the miners <e> <s> why do they not admit that they are using a minority decision of the british electors at the last general election for such it was for the purpose of disposing of the high moral principles which were embarked upon by the attlee government <e> <s> that is their purpose and they seem to be achieving it to a considerable extent except for the likelihood of a great deal of disturbance and confusion in the community

viscount realise that when he <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the views that many of us may hold about the policy adopted by the south african government are we to under <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the reasons why i asked the question was that i discovered to my astonishment yesterday that if the press reports are accurate our esteemed and i emphasise the term

nearly two years thereby making a very valuable contribution to the industrial position of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to trouble the house again but this is a subject in which i have taken a profound interest for many years <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that although i recognise that at the last election the government were given a mandate which enabled them to dispose of

question which was one of the purposes of putting down my original question whether in view of the continued existence of pows after a state of affairs which continued for several years while the attlee government was in office there is anything in the cabinet records which obviously are at the disposal of the noble lord to indicate that either at the war office when i was present as secretary of state for war or at the ministry of defence when i was minister of defence the matter was ever brought to my notice <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord the minister observed the very heavy

to ask the minister whether he agrees that adequate civil defence is just as important as if not more important than either conventional or nuclear defence <e> <s> is he also aware that there is some reason to believe that a potential aggressor if he has not made adequate arrangements for civil defence has at least gone a long way in that direction <e> <s> finally i want to ask the noble lord whether speaking as he does for a particular ministry he really believes that that ministry has already prepared effective and adequate plans which could be readily implemented in order to ensure that we can provide some measure of protection for the civilian population <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that because the maritime nations as they may be called although some of them are very limited in character have adopted flags of convenience british shipowners have now decided in some respects also to adopt that method and that flags of convenience have led to a drastic reduction in safety aboard ship <e> <s> the noble lord the minister shakes his head <e> <s> i happen to know more about the subject than he does himself <e> <s> if i know nothing about anything else i know something about this <e> <s> is he aware that greek ships nigerian ships in particular and ships of many other maritime nations have adopted flags of convenience solely for the purpose of reducing

palestine refugees <e> <s> further in order to deal effectively with the refugee problem and resolve it as we would all wish irrespective of our views is it not essential first of all that there

essential that the arab countries should agree for the first time that they are no longer at war with israel <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house has referred to a wide-ranging inquiry <e> <s> may i say in passing that i think that in the minds of the public and of the members of your lordships house following the announcement about a wide-ranging inquiry the civil servants would be regarded as grateful if they brought the dispute to an end <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord whether the distinguished person who will conduct the inquiry will not encounter some inhibitions because of the recent statement attributed to the chancellor of the exchequer that in future pay settlements may not exceed per cent <e> <s> will that not be an inhibition from which the chairman of this inquiry may suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are grateful for his language but not for the action of the government <e> <s> if he were able to say how many local authorities have plans in their possession and that these plans can be readily implemented that would remove the apprehensions which exist among the general public <e> <s> is he aware that there is no evidence that the public are grateful for what has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we would all welcome world agreement to remove our apprehensions of the danger of another war <e> <s> but the difficulty of obtaining world agreement is even more of an obstacle than the provision of civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the foreign secretary is aware that while we appreciate that his approach to mr gromyko was animated by the best of intentions he should have realised that the subject of the soviet invasion of aghanistan was of much wider-ranging concern than to only the european council for example that the united states had made protests on the occasion of the invasion itself <e> <s> may i ask whether preparatory to his approach to mr gromyko he consulted the representative of the united states <e> <s> did the noble lord obtain as much as he expected <e> <s> would it not have been more effective if as representing the european council some of the foreign secretaries of france germany italy and the others i need mention no more had accompanied him and had informed mr gromyko that they were there representing not only the council but personally being personally concerned on behalf of their respective nations and even going the length of saying we shall not leave moscow until we get a satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order to ask questions on the order paper making reference to speeches that have been made by past prime ministers would it be in order for me to ask questions about mr gladstone and benjamin disraeli or to be more modern to ask questions about mr harold macmillan and even go so far although i do so with the utmost respect as to ask questions which refer to the activities of the noble lord lord home <e> <s> would that be in order <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be kind enough to tell the house the comparative costs of employing another minister

expected to do <e> <s> are they to refrain from using plastic bullets or cs gas or weapons of that kind <e> <s> has that consideration occurred to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not something to be said for the suggestion made by my noble friend lord jacques instead of a final shutdown to phase the closing down <e> <s> after all is said and done even the debate today will not be

i bow to the traditions of this noble assembly <e> <s> it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points that i should like to make in reply to the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> i would not for a moment impugn his integrity in connection with defence matters i recognise that <e> <s> but it seems to me that to intervene with an issue of this kind is forgetting the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords would the foreign secretary not agree that we must proceed further than a cease-fire in the middle east <e> <s> is it not necessary that the arab states including the plo which is not a state but nevertheless it is recognised by the arab states should agree no longer to make war on israel and on the other hand that israel should be asked not to resort to violence of any sort giving an opportunity to proceed to negotiations <e> <s> will he not use his persuasive powers to persuade both sides to adopt that attitude in order to bring this trouble to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us admire his capacity to defend very adequately the governments economic policy <e> <s> however would he not sometimes yield a little and admit that the governments economic policy has not been altogether an unqualified success <e>", "<cs> since i know nothing about this subject perhaps i may offer an observation <e> <s> i think we should get rather more clarification on one point which concerns me in particular and which might concern other members of the committee <e> <s> in the course of the debate a reference has been made to the united kingdom guaranteeing the security of belize in perpetuity <e> <s> i am bound to say that it amazes me that we can guarantee anybodys security in perpetuity <e> <s> we cannot even guarantee our own <e> <s> when i recall the controversies that have occurred in recent years over whether we could guarantee the security of the countries associated with nato and could make our contribution to that effect in perpetuity i do not believe that any member of your lordships committee will accept this particular point <e> <s> we have not got the strength neither are we likely to have it in the foreseeable or the remote future <e>", "<cs> i am not wholly satisfied by what my noble friend lord stewart has said much as i admire his skill and his knowledge in matters of this sort but what i am concerned about is this if belize is attacked that is a simple point is there a guarantee that we are going to furnish military assistance on behalf of belize against guatemala <e> <s> is that the position <e> <s> because when i consider the turbulence and the volatile attitude of south american states i am not at all sure that we are in a position to guarantee anybodys security there <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the forensic ability of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as one who is like other members of your lordships house deeply

moderate and temperate line in order to ensure that peace will emerge in the middle east at last <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are so optimistic about the future and feel that they are capable of solving all our problems including our financial problems then why not use some of the reserves available in order to boost up our exports <e> <s> either the government are entitled to be optimistic or they are operating under false pretences <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will disregard any suggestion which would appear to be either a snub or an offence to the soviet union <e> <s> would he not regard this question as perhaps one of the most important that has come before your lordships house <e> <s> because unless we can not only <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the leader of the house who are these highly favoured people who are immune from price rises <e> <s> are there any members of your lordships house in that category and if so who are they <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the apparent appointment of the red cross to deal with this shameful situation seems a bit odd <e> <s> is that the appropriate organisation to deal with the matter <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that apart from the shameful attacks on the vietnamese boat <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord cockfield a question <e> <s> he informs your lordships house that high interest rates have a beneficial effect so far as inflation is concerned they do not increase inflation <e> <s> if they are not detrimental to inflation then why not allow interest rates to increase and have the uncertainty so that inflation can be controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the expressions of sympathy for the several persons involved in this deplorable affair would be applauded by every member of your lordships house and by a very large body of people outside <e> <s> but expressions of sympathy while desirable in the circumstances to me do not seem to be enough <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister a question that may not have been put in the course of debates dealing with northern ireland and it is this <e> <s> how long is this affair going on <e> <s> how many years will elapse while scores of innocent people are slaughtered and how many years will elapse while the british taxpayer is being asked to accept a burden that it is doubtful he can afford <e> <s> also how many years will elapse while a very substantial and important element of the british forces are deployed in a task that they abhor as do we all <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord saw this question on the order paper did it ever occur to him to wonder or even to indulge in a bit of research about what the grandfather of the noble earl who has asked the question would have said about crumbling britain <e> <s> did he take the same line when he fought the war as perhaps winston churchill fought it in order to gain victory <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that our problem is not crumbling britain but grumbling britishers <e> <s> why do we indulge so much in stinking fish <e> <s> are we the only

marquess forgive me if i fail to follow him on a subject in which he is a notable specialist <e> <s> for myself i am just a novice perhaps an interested spectator <e> <s> i would rather refer to a habit i formed many years ago from which i am reluctant to depart <e> <s> it is that when i respect a person and particularly a colleague who is subject to harsh criticism then even if i disagree with him i am inclined to rally to his support and i refer as i suppose <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble lord say that it would be improper for the eec to cut across the initiative which is now in the possession of the united nations <e> <s> has not the eec by its initiative over the middle east problem cut across the initiative which is still in the possession of the camp david agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that inappropriate will satisfy me if it is a semantic discussion <e> <s> but get something done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although one would not wish to place any obstacle in the path of any peace proposal whether it emanates from saudi arabia or from any other quarter there is nevertheless something that must not be disregarded namely that although the camp david agreement in april developed merely into the withdrawal of israeli forces from sinai that agreement also provides for continuing negotiations <e> <s> those negotiations are of supreme importance <e> <s> will those who are talking about camp david being finished say no more about that and allow israel egypt and any other nation to sit down at a conference or in any fashion and try to work out a proposal which can produce peace <e>", "<cs> my lords is the foreign secretary aware that recent manoeuvres instead of being likely to promote peace are likely to produce another war <e> <s> is it not necessary to be a little cautious <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of course he is aware that not a single prominent representative of the palestine liberation organisation has declared its readiness to recognise israel and that even the saudi arabian peace proposals do not recognise israel <e> <s> they do not refer to it at all except to say that they want peace in the middle east <e> <s> we all want peace in the middle east <e> <s> is it necessary to proceed with these manoeuvres <e> <s> should we not recognise that israel will not allow syria or saudi arabia or any of the arab countries to interfere with the camp david proposals <e> <s> even if they appear to be innocuous the proposals at any rate provide an opportunity to negotiate the possibility of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the only reasonable and rational declaration that the west can make in the present international circumstances is to be strong <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last years since the united states agreed to an association with the other countries of the west in the north atlantic alliance and president truman agreed provided conditions were satisfactory and that we would meet our obligations that the then general eisenhower would be sent over to europe to act as supreme commander relations have been strained but they have been of a minor character <e> <s> after all we must take note that even among the americans relations are strained <e> <s> general haig does not always agree with defence secretary weinberger and sometimes we do not know who president reagan agrees with <e> <s> sometimes the americans doubted our sincerity and whether we meant business or whether we would provide the manpower equipment and expenditure and sometimes we were a little doubtful about the americans because they tried to indulge in domination and occasionally insisted that we must purchase weapons that we did not think necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for my intervention but my reason for not putting my name on the list is because i doubted very much when i read about the possibility of this debate whether there would be any interest displayed by members of your lordships house <e> <s> another reason why i failed to intervene in that fashion is because i have to declare <e>", "<cs> one

the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl lord avon not ignoring the important point which my noble friend lord beswick has raised namely that in various parts of london and one notices it

lords is the minister aware that the answer which he gave to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh and the addendum for which he was not asked have only increased the mystery about this affair <e>

place and also in this <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the rumours which are probably well founded that mr brezhnev is about to retire could a message from your lordships house be sent to him through the soviet embassy wishing him for the remainder of his life and we hope he has many years left yet peace and contentment and asking whether as a gracious act upon his retirement he will ensure that mr shcharansky is treated as a civilised person <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is satisfied that a great deal of money can be saved by transferring the collection of refuse from local

representations from many quarters and from overseas from ex-prisoners of war who believe that they have a substantial case <e> <s> is it not likely that this controversy will continue for some considerable time <e> <s> is there not the suitable and reasonable alternative that the government should agree to appoint a small committee of perhaps two or three judges or some members of this house who will be regarded as independent to conduct an inquiry and bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords why does not the minister disclose the fact that even if nato increases its military expenditure by per cent <e> <s> it is unlikely to reach the level incurred by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is possible that the soviet union is not paying the interest which is due to other countries on borrowed money because the communist philosophy is opposed to rates profit and interest <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether we are having another second reading debate <e> <s> it would appear to me that we are reaching that point <e> <s> issues have been raised that have been debated over and over again in another place and in your

instruction or a suggestion or a piece of advice to the canadian government apart from accepting the bill and agreeing to canadas sovereignty that they should do certain things in accordance with the

obvious <e> <s> but i should like an answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that that is a somewhat unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> does she also realise or do the government realise that the absence of some indication or suggestion of reform of your lordships house only serves to strengthen the attitude of those who seek to abolish this house <e> <s> is the minister aware that if at the next election political views take a certain direction there might be an immediate demand for the abolition of this house <e> <s> is not there every reason why both houses of parliament should begin to discuss even in a temporary and perhaps potential fashion what kind of reform is required for your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one further question <e> <s> is the minister aware that there are many members of your lordships house who have expressed the opinion that what is required even as a temporary measure indicating the need for some measure of reform is that we should deal with the obvious imbalance of numbers in your lordships house <e> <s> could we not begin with something of that kind which would indicate to the general public that while we wish to retain the house of lords as i do myself because i do not believe in a single chamber and have made that point quite obvious in my writings and speeches we are trying to create and forgive me for using the expression a more democratic assembly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the statement he has just made is the first frank admission by a member of the government that our expectations have not been fulfilled <e> <s> has he taken note of the erosion of our fishing industry of the escalation and prosperity of french agriculture in comparison with our own and over and above that the frightful humiliation to which the prime minister has been subjected in seeking to obtain from the eec and those associated with it a reasonable financial arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be kind enough to reply to the main point of my question namely how long is it going to be before her majestys government obtain from the eec complete satisfaction on the points raised in my question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that whether or not the foreign secretary visits israel whatever intentions he may have whether he intends to visit israel or remains away from israel there is not the slighest prospect of peace in the middle east until the arab countries whether collectively or individually decided to recognise the state of israel <e> <s> let there be no doubt about this i say it with the utmost emphasis in meaning what i say and backing begin if necessary there must be an assurance that israels security is assured while at the same

culprit is called upon to pay compensation to someone who is the victim of a criminal assault and declines or is unable to pay what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to estimate in financial terms the value of the transfer of defence research to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is directed not at the noble lord lord trefgarne but at the governments chief whip <e> <s> i want to ask this question because there is a danger that we might be entering into a kind of debate and this is not the appropriate occasion for that so many questions have yet to be answered <e> <s> i should like to ask the government chief whip is there likely to be another debate on this subject before the easter recess <e> <s> is the vacation to take place as arranged beginning on wednesday next <e> <s> these are very important questions and we want to know where we are <e> <s> the house should be in almost constant attendance while we are awaiting events in the argentine <e> <s> will the noble lord inform us whether there is likely to be an occasion for another debate <e> <s> otherwise some of us want to ask some very direct questions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl lord gowrie aware that none of the somewhat long statements that we have heard from the leaders of the oppositions has elicited the important element in this problem which is that in the opening statement the noble earl failed nor did any of those who followed him deal with the subject to state whether the new proposals the new device or apparently new device because as we are all aware the proposal for a devolved government is far from being original have received the majority consent of any of the sections in northern ireland <e> <s> or is it just an attempt on the part of a new minister who realises that his predecessors have failed to solve the problem to solve it by producing what might be called a gimmick just a leftover from a previous suggested solution <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of all that or does he come to the house making a statement about what is to happen in the future based on a white paper without making it quite clear to members of your lordships house that these proposals have the consent of any of the majorities on either side either those on the orange side or those in the minority <e> <s> unless he can do that i suggest that they are just wasting their time <e>",

by the minister on behalf of the government <e> <s> we have to operate within the provisions laid down by the security council <e> <s> in other words we have to pursue a course of conduct of a diplomatic character but at the same time we have to keep in reserve and i emphasise the reservation that it the diplomatic course fails we have no other alternative than to take forceful action much as we would regret it <e>", "<cs> my lords by any standards associated with your lordships house this has been a remarkable debate remarkable in the sense that in oratory and in eloquence it compares favourably with many other debates <e> <s> not that one takes exception to those debates of an inferior character <e> <s> we must be prepared to listen to all kinds and types of oratory and even eloquence <e> <s> but it is remarkable in another sense <e> <s> many of those who have taken part in the discussion seemed to avoid making reference to the primary issue perhaps because it presents problems which are difficult to solve complications contradictions having to turn the clock back revelations about our history criticisms of governments and of personalities associated with governments <e> <s> all that has emerged but rarely has attention been focused on the primary issue to which i venture to refer <e>", "<cs> that does not suit some of our people including some with whom i have been associated in the labour party but that does not worry me a bit <e> <s> many of them are pacifists many of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> it is a factual reply but i am not sure that it is encouraging enough <e> <s> would he agree with me that not a solution itself but an approach to the solution of the unemployment problem is the revival of international trade buying and selling high production cheap production if possible and high consumption <e> <s> that is what is required <e> <s> there are millions of people in the world who want more goods more implements more housing and all the rest and there are millions of people who are ready to do the work in order to provide them <e> <s> would the minister devote a little more attention to ascertaining whether our commercial attachs i am not making any criticism of them are getting their backs into it and boosting trade relations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i make no criticism of the commercial attachs or diplomats <e> <s> what applies to those who work on behalf of the government and the country applies equally to those in industry <e> <s> all i am asking for is that they should get their backs into it at a time when we need their services more than ever <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble baroness the leader of the house to have said that we are not prepared to negotiate under duress <e> <s> if that is the position ought we not to say that the argentinians should take their forces out of the islands and then we shall be prepared to negotiate <e> <s> is that not what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords why not get on with the war and damn the expense <e>", "<cs> my lords the lord privy seal in opening the debate explained its purpose and it was as i understood her observations to ascertain the views of members of your lordships house about the situation in the falkland islands <e> <s> if i had been consulted and that is asking too much about the nature of the motion on the order paper i would have worded it differently <e> <s> instead of asking that a note of the situation should be debated i would have asked for the approval of members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the least that we can be expected to do <e> <s> i must at this stage interrupt myself because i do not want to be accused of being a warmonger <e> <s> i do not like war any more than anybody else <e> <s> as it happens i am not called upon to participate in the conflict <e> <s> that is sometimes embarrassing because when one takes part in a debate on a subject of a military character one can at once be

speeches made in the past and which are recorded in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that reply may i ask one question <e> <s> when are we likely to reach <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not asking too much at the present time to ask the government to intervene in wage negotiations <e> <s> have we not got another dispute on our hands <e> <s> although i usually support the workers in their demand for higher standards of living and will continue to do so would they not mind deferring consideration of these negotiations and demands until we have dealt with the people miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister since the police are deeply involved in this matter and are the principal targets of attack whether it has ever occurred to the government that the police force should be asked their opinion as to the type of weapon or means of defence that they might use in order to repulse attacks <e>", "<cs> my lords this casual irrelevant and somewhat unrealistic debate as i shall seek to demonstrate in the course of my few future observations was relieved by a remarkable maiden speech by the noble earl lord oxford and asquith <e> <s> it was a speech which i enjoyed not that i was in complete agreement with him <e> <s> on the contrary i was not <e> <s> but i shall not enter into any argument with him on this occasion <e> <s> my enjoyment derived from his presence which reminded me of his grandfather in when i became a member of another place and listened to the dignified eloquent oration of mr asquith <e> <s> on frequent occasions following his oration i ventured to ask a few questions most of which he disliked intensely <e> <s> anyhow the noble earl has made his maiden speech and a right good speech it was it was statesmanlike although perhaps a bit cautious because of the time available to him nevertheless it was well worth hearing <e> <s> we want him to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord was hiding himself <e> <s> he is present <e> <s> the noble lords speeches when he is engaged in discussing the middle east usually consist of giving the state of israel a good kick in the teeth <e> <s> what was he doing this afternoon <e> <s> what was his purpose to condemn israel and to condemn and criticise the united states of america for supporting israel <e> <s> he was actually suggesting that this arrangement this financial political but not military arrangement between the united states of america and israel had created a situation in the middle east which played right into the hands of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> i am coming to the end <e> <s> i did note however that many of those who spoke exceeded their time but i have no objection to that <e> <s> i am not going to argue any more <e>

whisky about which the great majority of physicians agree and is it not possible to make it available on prescription under the national health <e> <s> it would help the whisky industry and also help many of us who depend on that kind of medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not some misunderstanding about the question <e> <s> the minister referred to widows with children <e> <s> on the other hand the question refers only to widows <e> <s> surely in the case of widows with children there can be no hard and fast rule <e> <s> it is not only a matter of how many children there may be but the condition of the children has to be taken into account and whether they need health care or not <e> <s> moreover there are a variety of other circumstances which might be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords

or even whether this is the appropriate occasion but i am unaware of any other occasion when i can raise the matter <e> <s> it sometimes happens that when there are short debates for example there is

uttering a word of offence or criticism of the general conduct of the police of whom we are generally speaking proud may i ask whether this event seems to indicate that some sections of the police force are now yielding to the hypocritical pacifism and so-called humanitarianism that has disgraced our society recently during our troubles <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the chief whip a question arising from his announcement that a statement made this afternoon in another place on the events which have occurred in the past hours will be repeated here <e> <s> does he consider it sufficient in the circumstances because of what has happened and because of those who may be regarded as responsible for what has occurred to content ourselves with a few questions from selected individuals in your lordships house <e> <s> would it not be better in all the circumstances because this is a most deplorable event which cannot be ignored or covered up in any sense to have a debate on the matter <e> <s> in the circumstances why should we not meet tomorrow or at least on monday for the purpose of discussing the matter in a full debate <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that in view of the frequent statements issued by the ministry of defence about an imminent assault on port stanley and the surrounding area the events recorded in the last hours are unexpected and exceedingly disturbing <e> <s> would he not agree that much of the trouble has occurred because of political intervention not only in the united kingdom but in the security council and the united nations and from oscillations in american attitude and also the frequent mischievous statements that have appeared in the press media <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the percentage of unoccupied houses in public ownership is much too high <e> <s> the principal reason for the high percentage is that local authorities which have the responsibility are not permitted to spend sufficient money to put those houses in order <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware that the term that she used the practice of the house is becoming a bit outmoded <e> <s> is she aware that over the years certainly since i have been a member of your lordships house i have observed how what are called the practices of the house the ritual pass through almost on the nod because really no notice is taken of these matters <e> <s> but in the course of time peoples minds change and new practices are required so that we must have regard to the inevitability of change <e> <s> surely the time has arrived when if the report of a select committee has been considered by a committee of the house and a member decides to record his dissent that dissent should be recorded immediately in the report and not have to wait for subsequent evidence for when it comes <e>", "<cs> to a matter of subsequent evidence it is usually in small print and nobody pays attention to it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in every other respect our achievements in the recent falklands affair and the efforts of our forces backed by the ministry of defence are worthy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether or not it would be premature to come to any definite conclusions and decisions either about the future administration of the falkland islands or about the situation of the government or any proposed government in the argentine <e> <s> do we not have to consider the danger which might emerge unless we come to a rational conclusion in which perhaps the united states the commonwealth and other south american countries are involved <e> <s> what might happen would be the taking over in some form of the north atlantic countries in the antarctic by the soviet union <e> <s> there is the prospect of a fascist government <e> <s> that would be dangerous enough but it might be only temporary <e> <s> if however the soviet union took advantage of the situation of the muddle and confusion which exists and the difficulty of coming to a conclusion even in your lordships house as the result of a debate which requires much careful inquiry we should be paving the way for the soviet threat to become not only a challenge but a fact of life <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are unable or unwilling to provide a forecast may i ask the noble earl whether there is a possible estimate of the amount of construction reconstruction and rehabilitation that is urgently required in the united kingdom and if there is such a forecast how does it compare with the amount required to be done <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that if we did all that requires to be done and urgently requires to be done we could provide employment for at least million people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to trouble the minister but may i ask him a further question which is relevant <e> <s> would it not be possible for the government to provide some estimate or forecast of the kind of work and the amount of work that requires to be undertaken so that people in this country will know what is possible even if it is not probable <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noted that the noble lord lord chelwood apart from a wholesale condemnation of the state of israel without regard to any justification on the side of israel whatsoever is asking for assurances of the most drastic character from israel is demanding the imposition of sanctions is demanding that there should be withdrawal of the necessary finance to which israel is entitled <e> <s> in the circumstances of the condemnation for which the noble lord lord chelwood is responsible and as there does not appear to be a satisfactory answer from the government indeed it is far from satisfactory has it occurred to the noble lord that there is an opening for the noble lord lord chelwood and those who agree with him that if they cannot obtain satisfaction by imposing sanctions by destroying israels trade by imposing financial difficulties on them they should go to war with israel <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall though he could hardly do that he was much too young our experience after the first world war when we demanded reparations only to discover that it worked to our disadvantage <e> <s> ought we not to be very careful about compensation <e> <s> perhaps it is far better to forget about it though it is perhaps difficult <e>", "<cs> i never thought when i took part in the debates on the industrial relations bill in and that i would ever be involved again i suffered enough <e> <s> but as i understand the subject of this debate i have some difficulty in following it it appears to me to be somewhat complicated and i am a little out of touch with these

should be no publicity whatever <e> <s> that is what i understand the debate to be about <e>", "<cs> this amendment may not be regarded as the most significant feature of this legislation either one way or another but it has an aspect which is closely related to the principle which i think is uppermost in the minds of members on all sides of this chamber <e> <s> if i need any justification for my intervention i can only claim i think there is abundant evidence in support of my claim that i am in fact the author of the closed shop <e> <s> that means going fairly far hack into industrial history

salaries on the one hand and low wages on the other which was admitted by one of his colleagues this afternoon in reply to a question not to government policy but to the conservative concept of one nation <e>", "<cs> my lords surely some tasks could be allotted to these men who have fought on behalf of the country and been wounded rather than to throw them onto the unemployed heap <e> <s> do we not have enough unemployed <e> <s> surely there are semi-military tasks partly of a civil character and partly of a military character on which these wounded men could be employed <e>", "<cs> my lords

debating material <e> <s> we can hardly claim to be unanimous <e> <s> there has been much confusion about our defence strategy and our intentions and all the possibilities that derive from our commitments in various parts of the globe <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not find it embarrassing to exchange views with a socialist government <e> <s> is there not a danger of him being

philosophical <e> <s> i shall mention no names <e> <s> i have no desire to indulge in any offence or criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree looking several years ahead long after many of us will cease to be in operation that it is a mistake to rely too much on coal development <e> <s> in fact we are wasting a great deal of coal for the purpose of producing energy which could be produced by the development of nuclear and other derivatives <e> <s> therefore are the government satisfied with the use made of coal at the present time <e> <s> would it not be better to use it for processing purposes producing valuable other materials <e> <s> can the noble earl say whether they are satisfied with the development of nuclear energy <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the ministers doubts about whether there will be a resumption of civil war in the lebanon it will be noted that he is unable to furnish any guarantee <e> <s> indeed it is not at all unlikely that there will be a resumption of civil war in which by the way the israelis would not be participating <e> <s> i hope that note will be taken of that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i have no special interest and certainly no shares in the british oxygen company <e> <s> are we to understand from the ministers reply to my noble friends question that there is a definitive and established principle associated with this subject namely that the government rely on competition although apparently not in this instance <e> <s> are we to accept this definitive final and established principle

doubts as to whether the government deserve congratulations <e> <s> on the whole i think that he ought to give the government some credit for this is by no means a new controversy <e> <s> i doubt whether anybody else in your lordships house can recall as i can the controversy at the beginning of the century when macbraynes exercised a monopoly over the western highlands traffic and the traffic south of the highlands <e> <s> it was one of my tasks as organiser for one of the seamens unions to try to persuade the men on the macbrayne vessels to become members of the organisation <e> <s> we had a frightful row with macbraynes about it but now something has happened <e> <s> i am not so sure that past labour governments made a very effective contribution in spite of the remarkable efforts

about this matter <e> <s> is there any real anxiety about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether this is not another example and i regret to ask this question but i feel that i must of the failure to implement what was a general opinion expressed by almost every speaker who took part in the recent debate on the subject initiated by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> when the house and almost every speaker on both sides directs attention to the importance of a question of this kind and then we find the government saying that they will have to consider this

the farming community have objected to land which is regarded as important from the standpoint of agriculture being used for defence purposes <e> <s> although agriculture is of the utmost importance even more important surely is the security and defence of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be the last person in your lordships house to prevent any member asking questions that is the very

who often asks very sensible questions i am sorry but on this occasion i think it is completely uncivilised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the question addressed to him by my noble friend lord mishcon is not contained in the labour manifesto <e> <s> is it not improper that a member of our front bench should raise an issue which is in violation of decisions taken by our annual conference year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords if i intervene on this item it is because i had contemplated putting down a motion on the principle involved <e> <s> i welcome the motion <e> <s> if the chairman of committees will permit me to offer an opinion not advice but an opinion and i have every confidence in the chairman of committees i welcome further consultation with those in another place

lords may i ask the noble earl whether he admits as he must admit that both gas and electricity are profitable industries <e> <s> he admits that <e> <s> then if they increase prices is that not profiteering <e> <s> is not profiteering part of conservative policy <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances that we may discover a loss of that energy which is essential if we are ever to hope for recovery or even to continue in our present situation is it not of the utmost importance that we should cease to close down pits even if some of them are unprofitable and uneconomic because in the course of a few years we may discover that even uneconomic pits are essential in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl what is an uneconomic pit <e> <s> is he aware and i am sorry to ask this question because it is long before the noble earls time many years ago when i first came to another place way back in they closed down pits in lanarkshire as a result of which a vast number of people were unemployed only to discover a few years later that they were able to reorganise the pits and that they are now operating <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question about procedure <e> <s> on those occasions when we have short debates as for example today <e>", "<cs> a very important issue is raised <e> <s> a large number of noble lords wish to take part in the debate <e> <s> why should we have these long wordy statements thrust upon us <e> <s> i am not seeking to criticise but merely stating a fact <e> <s> in two cases ministers have taken a quarter of an hour or minutes to repeat a statement made in another place and then from our side we have two front bench speakers not ordinary people like ourselves <e>", "<cs> who made long speeches for example on agriculture and on other subjects <e> <s> surely some arrangements can be made so that our short debates are not interrupted as they have been today <e> <s> moreover when long statements of this character are made instead of only a couple of front bench speakers taking nearly an hour between them to express their views could not the whole subject be thrown open to general debate so that some of us on this side of the house who are not so well educated or well-informed as the front benchers can offer an opinion <e> <s> i should like an answer to that question of procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the sympathy expressed on behalf of beer drinkers although i never drink the stuff myself may i ask the noble lord whether he would express a little sympathy for those who partake of other liquid refreshments <e> <s> frequently when one asks for a double whisky i will not say where i exclude your lordships house and the environment they sometimes add rather too much water <e> <s> can something be done about that <e> <s> why should there be a monopoly for beer drinkers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for that gracious reply but it could have been a little more definite <e> <s> he suggested something about the usual channels <e> <s> i hardly appreciate that because they do a lot of talking but take very little action <e> <s> when channels are regarded as a useful facility nothing really happens except there is talking <e> <s> i am far from objecting to repetition in your lordships house of statements made in another place it is exceedingly important that we should be informed but is it to the credit of your lordships house that distinguished educationists should have been prevented from expressing their opinions because an important debate was interrupted in order to repeat a statement from another place <e> <s> would it be possible for the chief whip perhaps along with some of his colleagues in other parties to come to a decision on this matter in order to avoid a repetition of what happened recently <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount appreciate that my primary concern is not to weaken the authority of another place nor at the same time do i wish to weaken the prestige of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that while several periodicals national newspapers and the like and possibly some members of the government some members not all and some members of parliament even including some members of your lordships house are deriving some pleasure i use that term an obnoxious term in these circumstances from the dispute that is taking place among the miners as well as the dispute itself there are many of us who are more concerned primarily concerned about economic recovery and the possibility of providing people with gainful employment and who derive no pleasure whatever from what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords the organs of communication in your lordships house have always been regarded as highly efficient even the most critical of members have been afforded moderate satisfaction <e> <s> but i must confess that to me something appears to have gone wrong this afternoon <e> <s> according to the information conveyed to me speeches were to be regarded as unnecessary on this occasion possibly there would be a word of commendation aye no or perhaps moderate on one side and tendering thanks on the other as is customary <e> <s> but i was unaware that some of the most distinguished speakers in your lordships house representing all the official parties some may be regarded as unofficial or semi-official but let us not go into that would voice their opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be kind enough to tell your lordships who the noble lord was who made that long speech just now <e>", "<cs> my lords if this sort of thing can happen in times of

<e> <s> do we not have to wait for what happens and when it happens shall we not know what is going to happen <e> <s> we shall be destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a european initiative is desirable not only because it might effect consensus instead of the continued confrontation but for military or peace reasons <e> <s> why allow the intervention of the united nations

from the very beginning on the subject of the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for being a bit precipitate but i want some information about this <e> <s> the noble viscount the leader of the house will agree that this is a matter of supreme importance <e> <s> it is the question of whether we can restore our manufacturing position <e> <s> i should like to know in the first place is there a similar select committee in the other place <e> <s> if so how long has it been operating and with what result <e> <s> is it necessary to duplicate the effort <e> <s> if so would it not be desirable here i raise a point that i intended to raise in a previous question but was unable to do so because i was ill at the time to arrange that a select committee of your lordships house could of its own volition enter into discussions with the select committee of the other place with a view to using their combined talents experience and knowledge in order to deal with the aforesaid subject <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has always advocated public ownership otherwise known as nationalisation may i ask the minister whether he is aware that experience has demonstrated that there is one principal defect in public ownership as it operates at present and as it has operated for some time past <e> <s> its principal defect is a complete failure to consult and inform as it should do the consumers <e> <s> the consumers are entitled to much more information than is provided through the medium of what is a faade the consumer councils <e>

matter be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be excused for following up a matter that i raised yesterday when it seemed to me that the leader of the house rebuked me for having suggested that we in your lordships house should not have a particular select committee <e> <s> i raise the same issue this afternoon <e> <s> it seems to me unnecessary to appoint a house of lords committee on science and technology even on the assumption that every one of its members possesses expertise on the subject although that may be going a bit too far <e> <s> i do not however criticise any abilities that they possess <e>", "<cs> my lords i willingly express my gratitude to the noble viscount the leader of the house for that very excellent reply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house whether he agrees that on several occasions we have had either reports of summit meetings or orders in council galore <e> <s> there has been any number of orders in council that we have had to listen to and much has been said about achieving objectives <e> <s> but in point of fact there is nothing meaningful about it we have achieved little or nothing <e> <s>

such as mr <e> <s> prior who did his very best in difficult circumstances and by others as indeed by everybody here <e> <s> one has to recognise that unless we can remove the principle to which we attach so much importance namely that nothing can be done in the rate of progress towards a solution without the consent of the people of northern ireland we might as well close the door completely <e> <s> and there is little or no hope of that so long as there are sectarian differences as there are at the present time and as there have been for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be advisable if members of the government were a little cautious about answering questions always in the affirmative as if they can do something about it <e> <s> is it not a fact i say a fact that those areas in the channel any part of our coast any part of the seas throughout the world where garbage is disposed of are the best fishing grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are

to enlighten me on this subject <e> <s> i require a bit of information <e> <s> my memory goes back some years or so which is a considerable time <e> <s> this subject has been mentioned several times

great deal has been said about espionage <e> <s> some people have been undergoing prosecution because of the allegations made against them which have been proved <e> <s> in the circumstances are we to

event of this country having to face aggression we shall be compelled to do in retaliation things much worse than anything israel has ever done <e> <s> to talk about the action of israel in comparison with others is talking in the most futile fashion <e> <s> in any event it will not be of any value <e> <s> if the middle east question is to be solved the <e>", "<cs> my lords if israel could agree with the lebanon if iraq could agree with iran and so on there might be a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply although i found the answer to the final part of my question profoundly disappointing <e> <s> i will not blame the minister for that <e> <s> is he aware that it is now more than years since the late mr lloyd george introduced a pilot scheme at the metropolitan gas works in london for the processing of coal which i supported as i have continued to do ever since <e> <s> when i was minister for power i asked the prime minister to agree to the integration of oil gas and electricity into an energy policy but that has not been done <e> <s> is the minister aware that millions of pounds of our taxpayers money have been spent in the production of coal in its raw state which is used in its raw state <e> <s> as a result of this it has been affected by geological faults subsidence and a number of other problems that have occurred underground <e> <s> in order to create as we all wish to do a viable and profitable mining industry surely it would be more appropriate to use in the coal industry technologically advanced modern conditions to produce a variety of products which can be placed on the market and provide work for a vast number of people instead of people going underground to undertake work of this kind <e> <s> when will the govenment face up to this question of processing on a big scale in order to make this industry great <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that with modern conditions the time has arrived when we should cease opening new coal mines or continuing with a large number of them irrespective of whether they make a profit <e> <s> many of them never make a profit never did and never will <e> <s> is he aware that we should process the coal turning it into byproducts <e> <s> when the minister speaks about the fact that billions of pounds have been spent he is not altogether accurate <e> <s> i do not blame him for this <e> <s> i ought to see the details and i think he ought to see them himself <e> <s> in fact billions of pounds have been spent on producing new mining equipment to the advantage of those who produce such equipment and make a profit on it <e> <s> we ought to stop this kind of situation <e> <s> for example one of the things we can do is to liquefy the coal underground <e> <s> it would save a lot of trouble <e> <s> it would be more expensive to begin with but in the long run it would pay the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister <e>", "<cs> i am not making a speech my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question <e>", "<cs> no hooliganism my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is it reasonable for the minister to pass the buck to the local authorities when the local authorities have had their grants reduced and are being asked to accept the responsibility for expenditure etc <e> <s> will he take note of this <e> <s> we very often complain about the absence of human rights in other countries <e> <s> that was the subject of a debate quite recently in your lordships house <e> <s> i know that concerns the government as it does every one of us <e> <s> in those circumstances are not other countries entitled to refer to the absence of human rights when almost people in this civilised country of ours are homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not entitled to further enlightenment on the statement made by the noble lord the chairman of committees on the matter of confining ourselves at question time to asking for information <e> <s> it is not a matter merely of getting the information for which one has asked surely one is entitled to put a supplementary question in order to notify the minister that his previous answer was unsatisfactory <e> <s> the only redress open to us is to raise a short debate but short debates are not always very satisfactory <e> <s> where it is a matter of public interest which is raised such as was mentioned by i think the noble lord lord shackleton and the press hardly attaches the slightest importance to it surely it is very desirable from the standpoint of the prestige of your lordships house to get some publicity for it <e> <s> the only way that can be done is by asking a question and sometimes a supplementary question is more important than the question itself <e> <s> what i object to is the reading of questions just as i object to the reading of speeches <e> <s> i think that both are unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask for information can the noble baroness tell us whether when the government decide what is a healthy diet we can be assured that everybody in the country is going to get it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that this wage reorganisation was first enacted in in the board of trade by no less a person than winston churchill <e> <s> as a matter of fact i know all about it because he made me the scottish <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps your lordships will permit me to indulge in two introductory observations <e> <s> the first is that we were able at the outset of the debate with comparative ease to dispense with the customary congratulations <e> <s> obviously the noble lord lord home of the hirsel is an exception <e> <s> he has the highest respect of every member of your lordships house and when he speaks we listen because of his clarity his experience and his understanding <e> <s> it can be left there for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords since the original question was asked by a noble lord representing the liberal party may we have a little information regarding from where the liberal party get their funds <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible that the ministers right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport made no reference to maritime affairs because the government have no policy on maritime matters <e> <s> this is a very serious situation because in terms of the possibility i would not put it higher than a possibility that we might be faced at some time with aggression we will find that in lacking an effective and adequate maritime policy we will not have the faintest chance of gaining a victory <e>", "<cs> without discussing the merits of the issue before the committee i confess that i am not <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> so far i have endured or tolerated a very substantial intervention <e> <s> in ordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister whether he is aware of any member of your lordships house having been sponsored by any of the tobacco firms <e> <s> is he aware of anything of that kind going on <e> <s> is he aware that i have been smoking for ever so long as i can remember since i was aged and that i still indulge in an occasional whiff when it suits me <e> <s> i do not ask permission from anybody whoever they happen to be and however prominent they think they are <e> <s> i have never been sponsored by a tobacco firm but perhaps they would like to start it now <e> <s> my stock of tobacco has run short <e> <s> i do not mind <e> <s> after all there is nothing really seriously wrong with smoking there is no corruption about it <e> <s> if there was any corruption i should have nothing to do with it i assure even my noble friend lady ewart-biggs that i would have nothing to do with it <e> <s> i cannot understand why she raises this question <e> <s> i should have thought that she was the kind of person who occasionally indulges in a cigar <e>", "<cs> may i without any knowledge of the subject at all i make my confession to begin with add my word to some of the speeches to which we have listened this afternoon and to some of the speeches we heard last week <e> <s> as this debate has proceeded i have listened to most of it and what i have failed to listen to i have read in the reports that are available to us almost every day i have come to the conclusion that there is a general desire which applies to every member of your lordships chamber that something should emerge as a result of our debates which is devoid of anything in the nature of bias prejudice or distasteful features that exist in our minds because of what has been happening for some years now under the glc <e> <s> occasionally there has been a kind of arrogance i would not put it higher than that on the part of those associated with the glc in their advertisements and in the manner in which they have availed themselves of their finances and so on about which some of us perhaps because of a lack of knowledge or expertise of the subject have felt there is something wrong and that something ought to be done to correct the situation and remove the defects which appear to be obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount the leader of the house agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to ask a question <e>", "<cs> very well my lords go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount the leader of the house agree that if the noble lord speaking for the liberals can occupy our attention for nearly minutes in a speech one might from this side of the house ask a simple question arising from the statement that he was kind enough to make that is about the attitude of france <e> <s> we learn from the press that for some reason though so far as i know nothing has been discovered as to the cause the french did not support the otherwise unanimous decision of the summit conference <e> <s> can we understand the reason for that <e> <s> if there is to be another conference and france may be asked to change its mind how is that to be brought about <e> <s> can the noble viscount the leader of the house explain this attitude of france and why it is adopting this attitude <e> <s> there must be some reason for it <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are entitled to express our distaste at certain events which take place in south africa and other countries apart from the united kingdom can the noble baroness say whether at the same time the south african government have made any representations to the united kingdom government about violent events which have taken place in this country <e>", "<cs> i should <e>", "<cs> obviously there is some confusion in the minds of those members of your lordships committee who are not experts in matters of local government <e> <s> we have to follow the experts and as there is a variety of them most of them adopt different lines of thought and so it is very difficult to come to any conclusion <e> <s> my purpose in rising to intervene before the noble lord the minister makes some observations is that i feel that the noble baroness was justified in indulging in what has been a moderate criticism that has developed in the course of this debate <e> <s> that criticism should not be levelled against members of your lordships committee <e> <s> if it has to be directed at all it should be directed against the government <e> <s> i shall give one example <e> <s> the minister the noble lord lord elton if i may have his <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble lord has just said some of this money either in instalments or in total goes into the exchequer what programme does it finance <e> <s> can the noble lord specify any particular programme constructive in character which has the effect of reducing unemployment or which even helps to make it unnecessary to borrow more finance from abroad or from people in this country <e> <s> can he specify anything at all or will he just indulge in some casual talk about it without having any knowledge of what is happening <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> is not the trouble that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls is obsessed with just this <e> <s> he is concerned with developing competition no matter where it is and so he does not at all mind competition among a great variety of local boroughs competition about the parks and how they should be run competition about funding competition about everything as long as he gets what he wants in the way of competition <e> <s> it is a matter of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question <e>", "<cs> my lords just one point <e> <s> if everything is satisfactory all the rules are carried out there is thorough efficiency a secret ballot is taken and even by say half a dozen votes they decide to have a strike does that mean that the strike then becomes legal <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not some government departments which have a monopoly and which we could dispose of and then get some money out of them <e> <s> take as an example it has just occurred to me mi which has been a complete failure for many years <e> <s> we could sell that off quite easily and some of us would be glad to take some shares in it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been frequently told by members of the government that one of the <e>", "<cs> may i say <e>", "<cs> i am a back-bencher but back-benchers should have an opportunity to speak <e> <s> i will not be long i assure you <e> <s> i want to declare an interest <e> <s> i am president of the easington council for voluntary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if that answer means that the noble baroness is not satisfied i am not surprised <e> <s> it follows the line of her statesmanlike speech on rd april when many of my colleagues decided to give the russians a chance to show what they could do <e> <s> now they have demonstrated what they cannot do and will not do <e> <s> that is precisely what i predicted <e> <s> i could put the usual question and ask what the government are going to do about it but what is the use <e> <s> the government can do nothing about it <e> <s> they dare not do anything about it <e>", "<cs> i have had difficulty in following some of the speeches because of the unsatisfactory audition <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning speaks if i may say so with no disrespect to other members who have spoken with excellent clarity <e> <s> one can understand what he is saying he has the elocution that is required <e> <s> i leave that part of the subject alone at present <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble lord the minister to reply to my noble friend to the effect that the government do not intervene because it is not the governments business it is a matter for the railways board <e> <s> if that is so surely we cannot leave the matter of providing equipment for the railways of this country railways being associated with the need for communication and communication being one of our first priorities to the decision of the railways board <e> <s> surely this is a matter in which the government must intervene and declare a national policy <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble earl is about to sit down may i venture since my name has been mentioned and as i have to go in any event to correct an impression <e> <s> something has been quoted from my writings about my submission to the miners on the occasion when i was engaged in preparing legislation for the nationalisation of the coal industry <e> <s> i beg members of your lordships house not to pay the slightest attention to my writings whether they be in the book that was mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls seeking to establish a new principle namely that those who are unable to accept every word every line and every comma of a bill that is before your lordships are entitled to frighten the government but on no account must they seek to wound by entering the division lobby <e> <s> what is remarkable about an effort of this kind is that the government can defeat the opposition at almost any time they like <e> <s> it is only a matter of sending out telegrams to all quarters of the united kingdom to members of your lordships house very esteemed colleagues who sometimes for reason into which we are not entitled to enter absent themselves <e> <s> but there are occasions when arms are twisted and they find themselves in the division lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that important question asked by the noble lord lord boothby may i ask whether there is not a rule or an understanding which enables members of another place and of your lordships house to obtain access to parliament without difficulty <e> <s> are the police advised about that and requested to render assistance if there should be any difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely doubtful whether when the bill came in its present form before the house many members of your lordships house expected the noble minister to make such an informed although undoubtedly depressing statement about the future of the coal mining industry <e> <s> the facts speak for themselves <e> <s> one fact is that only two noble lords put down their names to take part in the debate <e> <s> if i had known that the minister was to make such an important statement i would certainly have put my name down to speak however because i did not know the ministers or the governments intention as an alternative i have put down a question about the production of certain products which the coal mining industry could undertake <e> <s> i note that that question will come before your lordships house on a friday morning <e> <s> i shall leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that market forces must operate in this connection <e> <s> pehaps an even more important point is that a non-trading sector of the public service might be more profitable than a trading sector and would therefore be worthy of higher remuneration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for furnishing the information for which i have asked <e> <s> i also apologise to him for bringing him here on a friday morning <e> <s> i asked for an available date and this is what they have done to me i never expected this <e> <s> however i am very glad to meet the minister and noble lords on a friday morning <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that i am fully cognisant of the excessive costs involved <e> <s> i discovered this in when after lloyd george had abandoned a scheme of his own i introduced a pilot scheme when i was able to get from the then chancellor of the exchequer philip snowden <e> <s> then it disappeared <e> <s> i know that the cost is excessive but let us compare the cost with the provision of new machinery introduced into the pits wage costs the difficulties associated with geological faults and the rest <e> <s> we must i suggest proceed with a scheme of the kind which is being partly developed by the coal board though not to the extent that is necessary in order to use our assets advisedly <e>", "<cs> my lords if i fail to follow the noble viscount lord eccles in his submissions about defence strategy it is not because i reject any word he uttered in that connection it is because although i have no standing engagement for dinner or anything else tonight physical deterioration makes trouble for me as the day wears on and i may have to leave before the end <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> however as i have been interested in defence matters for many years even as far back as the boer war the first world war and the second world war and in all the turbulent affairs in which we have been compelled to indulge i thought that i might make a contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon my noble and learned friends question may i ask whether it is not of the utmost importance that the house should be informed of the decision reached by the select committee on this question of future televising or ceasing to have anything to do with television <e> <s> surely we can ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount the leader of the house has answered the question i intended to put <e> <s> i apologise for my confusion which i hope will be only temporary if that is any relief to my colleagues in your lordships house <e> <s> however does the noble viscount not agree that it is of the utmost importance that before we embark on any debate either for or against television in your lordships house we should have an opportunity to consider the substance of the select committee report so that we are able to prepare our speeches <e>", "<cs> in the debate various terms have been used <e> <s> i have been trying to follow their meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made i did not expect it to what happened in when winston churchill decided as president of the board of trade to introduce what was called not wages councils but protection against the possibility of employers using slave labour cheap labour <e> <s> i was appointed by winston churchill himself although why he appointed me i am unable to say it was a long time ago when i was president of the glasgow trades council <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness agree that despite the somewhat subdued <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is an absence of the treaty asked for in this question can we be assured that as regards the need for military co-operation there is no difficulty whatever <e> <s> can the noble baroness say that there is complete unity in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness understand that there is not much value in what is called political co-operation which undertakes various aspects on which there is agreement if there is not complete co-operation in the matter of dealing with aggression if it should emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord regard that as a completely satisfactory answer in view of the reports which we have received of late about servicemen having served the five or six years which they undertook to serve when they were recruited no longer wishing to remain in the services <e> <s> there may be some reason for that <e> <s> the loss of the services of experienced men of that kind perhaps on medical grounds is a matter for consideration by the ministry of defence and by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness agree with me that there is no justification for any anniversary or anything in the nature of celebrations emerging from the helsinki final act <e> <s> would she take notice of what i said some months ago in her presence and in the presence of many of my colleagues distinguished and otherwise that when in there emerged a drastic even draconian change in the religious convictions of the leaders in soviet russia and the satellites there was no hope of coming to some satisfactory conclusion <e> <s> that was the position then and it still remains the position <e> <s> why do they not admit that we cannot change mr gorbachev his charm or his carry on at the present time which appears to be modernistic although it is nothing of the sort <e> <s> they play just the old game <e> <s> we cannot change them now and we had better make up our minds about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that my forthcoming birthday has nothing to do with the question <e> <s> i asked a simple question and surely she can answer that with all her experience <e> <s> if you <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister really regard his answer as satisfactory <e> <s> has he taken note of the fact that all select committees are very important and this is one of the most important <e> <s> the committee was appointed by your lordships house and should be amenable to your lordships house and it is in contempt of your lordships house if it does anything irregular <e> <s> a statement was issued to the press which was not available to members of this house <e> <s> apprehension was created in the minds of people of all political persuasions about the future of the country the cost of living and so on <e> <s> in those circumstances should the committee not have been condemned for its irregular action <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the use of bandying figures about in that fashion and wasting time <e> <s> even if the figure were reduced to million would not that be a disaster <e> <s> would it be anything for the government to boast about <e> <s> there ought not to be any unemployed at all <e> <s> no matter

minister say whether this telephone bingo will be privatised or nationalised <e>", "<cs> my lords with the highest respect to the noble lord the minister who i am sure is doing his best for all the members of the forces was his not a very unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> the minister made reference to some readjustment because of prices in germany as compared with prices in the united kingdom <e> <s> however has the minister taken into account the boring conditions in germany the fact that servicemen are tied down there for many months on end and that the terms conditions and environs in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may put another question with your lordships permission i ask the government to cut down a little on their fantastic ideas about space wars and satellite battles and all the rest of it which are purely imaginary and which are never likely to happen and instead give to the people in the forces the conditions to which they are entitled and for which they were recruited <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not opposing reference to a select committee of this very important subject of noble lords absences and reimbursements but when i see the names of those who will be responsible for examining reimbursements i wonder and i say this without any malice in my mind what their reimbursements are <e> <s> i ask this merely as a matter of enlightenment <e>", "<cs> my lords although we are all anxious to encourage the noble baroness in this very desirable objective to boost what we can show them why do we not also at the same time direct tourists who are coming here and who want to see what is happening in our great country to the thousands of houses no longer capable even of being disrepaired <e> <s> thousands of them are falling into decay <e> <s> if the tourists want to see the best side of the picture they might also see the other side at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that if any organisation is created which seeks to improve international understanding it will gain the support of the government and possibly be awarded the nobel prize <e> <s> if she did and if any member of your lordships house seeks to improve international understanding according to the way they look at it is there any likelihood of that member of your lordships house being awarded the nobel prize <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister this question <e> <s> is it good enough for the government for months and months to praise the virtues of competition and when they are asked a question as to whether they are making any savings from this workable virtue of competition all they can do is indulge in very vague talk about percentages <e> <s> what we want to know is are we saving any money <e> <s> if not why not tell us <e>", "<cs> but my lords in what respect of defence have we saved million <e> <s> is it good enough to tell this house of intelligent people without exception intelligent people that we have saved million without specifying on which particular item we have saved it <e> <s> the fact is we have saved nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to allow a debate to take place in this house to ascertain the views of members of all parties on whether this organisation which purports to have some theological basis is entitled to charitable status or any other kind of status <e>",

any part in the debate at all <e> <s> so far as the amendment is concerned valuable as it is either in principle or as an expedient or perhaps i may use rather different language and say as an escape from some further trouble and dispute among your lordships one thing is certain <e> <s> it is that there will be no unanimity of agreement among your lordships in this committee either on this aspect of the problem or any other <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether it would be appropriate to define what is meant by the term smoke <e> <s> we are told to believe but i cannot endorse the belief that pipe smoking is less dangerous than cigarette smoking and that cigar smoking is even worse but naturally cigar <e>"]
