["<cs> my lords while joining in the congratulations to the foreign secretary may i ask him whether it is not a bit too early despite optimistic expectations which one can understand to throw our hats in the air <e> <s> is it not on record that mr mugabe has declared himself as a marxist whatever that may mean <e> <s> i know that there are various definitions <e> <s> is it not also on the record that the patriotic front obtained a vast amount of war material from the soviet union <e> <s> therefore i should like to ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> would it not be appropriate to ask the soviet union to withdraw from afghanistan now that they have obtained indirect access to africa <e> <s> is it not fairly certain that the soviet union with their advisers and there are many of them will do everything possible to orient the policy of mr mugabe and his friends in their <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not gather from the noble lords answer what is the attitude of her majestys government about this matter <e> <s> will he take note because this has a bearing on the question on the order paper that the united states has declared that until the russians vacate afghanistan they will not agree to their people going to moscow <e> <s> what is the governments attitude to this matter <e> <s> have we now reconciled ourselves to the presence of the russians in afghanistan and are we taking no further action <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not find it surprising that her majestys government are asked to intervene in the amazon and other forests in brazil but are not permitted to intervene in the steel strike <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government adopt the principle of denationalisation of the shipbuilding industry can the noble viscount say in what circumstances they will adopt it when it is making a profit or when it is making a loss <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite correct in saying that local authori-ties do protect themselves against any form of corruption by any of their members <e> <s> we are well aware of corruption having taken place <e> <s> i shall not enlarge upon that as i think your lordships are sufficiently aware of what has happened in various parts of the country indeed when some members of local authority councils were imprisoned <e> <s> i think we must be careful not to put temptation in the way of governors <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether the noble baroness is right in failing to understand the kind and nature of items that would come before the governors as for example the maintenance of the school the provision of materials building and the like <e> <s> all those items would present opportunities to people who lack integrity so that there is the possibility of corruption <e>", "<cs> can we establish that one who is asked to attend these debates should not be regarded merely as an interested spectator or listener hut because we are discussing an education bill it might he appropriate to hear something about education <e> <s> so far i have not heard a word about it <e> <s> we have been spending a great deal of our time probably too much of it but i shall not make a complaint about that discussing the mechanics of education but of the substance and content of education not a single word has been said <e> <s> one might assume that that is because those who are present are incapable of discussing the subject although many of them from their contributions to which i have listened with my usual interest in such matters are if not professors or philosophers at any rate headmasters or ex-headmasters or ex-headmistresses and the like who are assumed to have a thorough-going knowledge about education <e>", "<cs> it is not the first time that i have been informed that i am in the wrong place in fact when i came here first that is what i was told <e> <s> but i shrugged that aside recognising it just as bias jealousy and the like <e> <s> it may be that i am misinformed and incapable of interpretation indeed you would not expect me to be otherwise but perhaps i could be informed what we are actually discussing <e> <s> if we happen to be discussing anything in the nature of transfer of a pupil <e> <s> from one school to another then i want to know what are to be the criteria i have got it at last which will justify the transformation <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is a misunderstanding that derives not so much from what i have ventured to say but from the reluctance on the part of our leaders on the front bench to deal with an earlier amendment amendment no <e> <s> which refers to <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend suggesting that when we reach clause i can repeat the speech i have already made <e> <s> there would certainly be nothing wrong in my doing that because everybody else in these discussions has repeated arguments over and over again <e>", "<cs> except to ask whether it is possible for anybody in this place from whatever part of the committee he or she comes to inject a sense of humour into this discussion <e> <s> frankly i do not think the whole thing is worth tuppence <e> <s> it reminds me of what voltaire said more than once when he was asked for his opinion of homer <e> <s> he said homer made the mistake of always repeating battles one after the other <e> <s> when asked for his view of seneca another philosopher and a rival of his he said that he just indulged in a load of rubbish <e> <s> i do not want that to be said of what has been happening here but if it goes on as it has been i may be forced to say it <e>", "<cs> earlier i ventured in my ignorance of the subject to ask when were we going to explain what we meant by education <e> <s> i was told i was addressing your lordships in the wrong place so i was told by my noble friend lord davies of leek <e> <s> that was due to my ignorance <e>", "<cs> yes i am quite sure all my friends the very few i have are very anxious to render the assistance i am very much in need ofotherwise i do not know how i should manage to survive at all <e> <s> however so far i have learned nothing about the substance and content of education <e> <s> i am not going to explain my view about it because this is not the appropriate occasion but at last i have discovered that in the opinion of two or three members of your lordships committee education of the higher quality should be specialised and explicitly directed towards certain qualifications which would enable a student to become an accountant or maybe a lawyer or a doctor or something of that sort <e> <s> well i do not know what might have happened when i was quite <e>"]
