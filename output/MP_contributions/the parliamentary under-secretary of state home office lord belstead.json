["<cs> my lords the governments view is that it would not be appropriate to implement the easter act without the full concurrence of the churches <e> <s> our present understanding is that such

lordships will know therefore that the noble earl would doubtless have wished to have incorporated some more sweeping changes than have been included in the bill which is before your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to express my gratitude to the noble earl for as i see it his realism in assessing the extent to which money can be devoted even to this cause a cause for which there must be widespread sympathy <e> <s> indeed in the letter from which the noble earl had the kindness to quote my right honourable friend the secretary of state made his concern for the victims of violence crystal clear <e> <s> i would also if i may congratulate the noble earl on the drafting of a bill which i am sure if i may say so parliamentary counsel would be happy to claim as his own

be of assistance to the government when the proposed bill on this subject is presented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sending my noble friend a table containing the information requested in the first part of his question together with a copy of an opcs monitor issued in april which gives figures for the electorate of every parliamentary constituency <e> <s> for the convenience of your lordships i will summarise the position as follows <e> <s> there are parliamentary constituencies in great britain with less than electors are labour conservative liberal plaid cymru and scottish national party <e>

attempt to remedy the unsatisfactory position <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i so confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for giving

right one <e> <s> nevertheless i very much welcome these amendments to which the noble lord has spoken and if i may i will confine my few remarks simply to the effect of subsection of new section a of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the noble earl lord longford this evening has moved your lordships to speak at this late hour from different points of view <e> <s> a former lord chancellor a former minister in the home office and a former permanent secretary noble lords who are experienced in working with people who are in prison establishments have spoken <e> <s> however if

the same form that was approved by your lordships house towards the end of the last session of the last parliament <e> <s> we have a great deal for which to thank the noble lord lord northfield in respect of that legislation and i am certain for a great deal of the work which has been done upon the present bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being

conditions there <e> <s> the government have no plans to amend the pet animals act <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government took into account some recent convictions of scientologists in the united states of america but did not consider that these were sufficient to justify maintaining the general ban on <e>", "<cs> the government agree with the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos that it is only reasonable that in the matter of making land available for development the land authority should have powers similar to those of local authorities and it is acknowledged that local authorities have the necessary power to requisition sewers which is the general effect of this group of amendments <e> <s> indeed from what the noble lord has explained to the committee if it were not for this group of amendments there is no question but that the land authority would be bringing land forward which would be of interest almost solely to the large developers and the danger would be that the land authority would find themselves concentrating their efforts on the provision of land for the larger builders who can make their own arrangements for servicing sites <e> <s> this is something we would not wish to be writing into legislation <e> <s> the land authority will of course be serving both large and small developers <e> <s> for those reasons very clearly explained by the noble lord the government are very ready to accept this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have decided that our acceptance of the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights

number of electors is buckingham with and that with the smallest is newcastle-upon-tyne central with <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted once again to the noble lord lord wigoder for bringing this matter before the house <e> <s> as the noble lord has explained this bill is identical to the one that he introduced last year which passed through all its stages in this house but made no further progress in parliament <e> <s> while there was general agreement last time and it has been echoed in the speeches made by the noble lords lord wigoder and lord boston that the present position on the reporting of committal proceedings gives cause for concern there was rather less agreement during our previous debates on this bill about the best way of curing it <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder proposed then as indeed he has again that in cases of dispute between multiple defendants in committal proceedings the court should decide whether or not to lift reporting restrictions by the test of the interests of justice <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the majority of courses leading to the certificate of qualification in social work end in the summer and some students particularly those whose mobility is limited may well be unable to obtain an early appointment as a probation officer in the area of their choice <e> <s> in the current year the position is complicated by a fall in the

secretary of state for scotland will be studying developments in northern ireland to see what lessons can be learned for the other prison systems in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord inglewood for his very clear explanation of the reasons which prompted him to move the second reading of this bill and for explaining to us the bills intentions <e> <s> as an almost total abstainer i have found this short debate extremely interesting and i am particularly grateful to my noble friend therefore for the clarity with which he introduced the second reading of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the clear way in which he has introduced this bill the purpose of which as he has described is to prohibit multiple registration of electors in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest year for which all the relevant information is available is <e> <s> in that year in the metropolitan police district about offences of burglary were recorded by the police it is not known how many of these offences resulted in convictions but in the same year the number of persons found guilty of burglary in the metropolitan police district was about <e> <s> information is not collected centrally on the number of cases in which a prosecution is pending <e> <s> there is no separate offence of housebreaking <e>", "<cs> while i appreciate the objective of the amendment i am a little sceptical about the value which it would have if it were to be written into the bill and i can quite understand the reasons which prompt the noble lord lord houghton to say that he does not wish to see the bill amended <e> <s> indeed i think probably all of us who are taking part in this committee stage on the bill would agree and i note that the noble lord lord beaumont has said that he will not press the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have at present no plans to

trading hours generally <e> <s> this work is nearly complete and the government hope soon to be able to announce their conclusions on the matter <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware however a bill to make changes in these laws which was introduced by a private member in another place failed to secure a second reading when it was debated there on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the case referred to <e> <s> it would not in any case be appropriate for the government to investigate such allegations against the police <e> <s> it is open to any person to make a complaint to the chief officer of the police force concerned who will arrange for it to be investigated in accordance with the statutory procedures <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary is confident that the commissioner of police of the metropolis is conscious in this as in other areas of the need to strike the right balance between enforcement of the law and the maintenance of good race relations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the practice of her majestys government to confirm or deny whether any person or place is subject to surveillance <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government will shortly be publishing their reply to the select committees report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris for this opportunity to set out the governments views on this draft directive and in particular on the conclusions reached in the ninth report of the european communities committee of your lordships house <e> <s> i should first say that the general attitude of the government to the objectives of this draft directive is influenced by the fact that under our system of immigration control the privileges that the directive seeks to give are as the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris recognised in his speech for the most part already accorded in practice to those people whom the directive would cover <e> <s> these would mostly be retired people persons of independent means and students <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to this short debate the answer to the noble lord lord avebury is to be found in subsection of clause <e> <s> i am replying to the noble lord lord houghton because when the noble lord moved an amendment on this subject during the first days debate in the committee stage my noble friend lord avon in good faith said the government would consider tabling their own amendment and it was subsequent to that that the department of my right honourable friend the home secretary looked at this question in more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to my noble friend lord gainford for his clear description of the bills intentions <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord boston of faversham that our licensing laws are very intricate and i was delighted to hear from my noble friend a definition of the difference between the carlton club and a nightclub <e> <s> more seriously it was most helpful to have my noble friends very clear explanation of the problem which the bill seeks to put right <e>", "<cs> my lords home office officials are currently arranging a survey of the incidence of alleged attacks by members of one racial group on another in a number of police areas <e> <s> they will also be visiting those areas to obtain at first hand the views of the ethnic minority

honourable friend the home secretary has now completed his review of electoral law and procedures and hopes to make a statement about his conclusions before long <e> <s> this will deal with among other things the proposal that united kingdom citizens resident abroad should be able to vote at elections in this country <e>", "<cs> i found it helpful that the right reverend prelate the bishop of winchester spoke at the beginning of the speech which he made on this amendment in quite broad terms because it reminded me at any rate of some of the major issues which are raised by this bill and they are issues which we shall be discussing in the next few minutes when debating this committee stage <e> <s> i think that there is one broad issue that perhaps i ought to bring to the notice of the committee and which was not put to your lordships in quite this way on second reading <e> <s> the noble baroness lady wootton referred to the law as it exists in other countries <e> <s> i am also so sorry that the noble baroness is unable to be here this evening and to learn the reason why she is absent <e> <s> however i thought that perhaps it would be helpful to the committee in deciding on the amendments which we have before us to have some further information about foreign law <e>", "<cs> my lords a small number of cells in local prisons are made available to the governor of each dispersal prison for the transfer of serious troublemakers for up to days <e> <s> this provides a brief cooling-off period for prisoners whose actual or likely disruptive behaviour threatens to cause difficulties and for whom segregation in the dispersal prison is inappropriate <e> <s> in most cases a prisoner returns to the original prison within days <e> <s> in some cases however it is decided that the prisoners should be transferred permanently elsewhere usually to another dispersal prison <e> <s> wherever possible this is done within days but sometimes the prisoner is held for a further limited period in the local prison because of the difficulties which arise in finding a new place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for briefly moving the amendment and i shall try to be reasonably brief although perhaps just a little longer than my noble friend <e> <s> first on the general merit of the case to which my noble friend has spoken i appreciate the humane considerations which lie behind this group of amendments <e> <s> the problem of air weapon misuse is of course one which extends beyond misuse against wildlife and embraces damage to property and indeed sometimes danger to the public <e> <s> this is more a problem of enforcement than a result of any inadequacy in the existing controls <e>", "<cs> after the valuable work of the select committee which produced the bill standing in the name of the noble earl lord halsbury and which is before us in committee today of course i accept that some detailed discussion is valuable <e> <s> indeed it would be undesirable if the bill went through without some discussion in committee in your lordships house <e> <s> i also realise as i think do all members of the committee that the bill contains an element of compromise <e> <s> that was inevitable <e> <s> however i was surprised to see the marshalled list of amendments for there are amendments on that list which give expression to what i imagine are the basic views of the noble lord lord beaumont and the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep under review both the working of suspended sentences and the possibility of implementing section of the criminal law act which provides for sentences to be partially suspended <e> <s> we have not so far introduced such sentences because of uncertainties about their effect on the size of the prison population if they were used instead of fully suspended sentences of imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule to the immigration act empowers an immigration officer to examine any person who is embarking or seeking to embark in the united kingdom for the purpose of determining whether he is patrial and if he is not for the purpose of establishing his identity <e> <s> the schedule also lays down that it shall be the duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i believe that the bill will be of particular interest to your lordships house since it is concerned with the reform and codification of an important part of our common law and with the repeal of an offence which has been much criticised for its defects and for its effect on community relations <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position like that of their predecessors is that the easter act should not be implemented without the full concurrence of the churches <e> <s> our discussions with the authorities of the church of england and the british council of churches lead us to believe that the churches are unlikely to agree on the date provided for in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning the remarks of my noble friend lord mottistone it may be necessary if the amendment is agreed to to look at its wording again <e> <s> i shall not express a view on the merits of the amendment because the government have all along maintained neutrality on the merits of the bill <e> <s> while the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich made it clear that the effect of the amendment would be to prevent for instance a stepdaughter marrying her stepfather provided she had been as a member of his family before the age of i would say that i am not

resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the immigration rules have been applied flexibly and with sympathy to those cypriots who came here as a result of the hostilities in and it remains the governments policy that a persons stay here will be extended exceptionally if it appears that the situation in the island makes it unreasonable to expect him to return there <e> <s> the situation is not covered by the convention relating to the status of refugees and the grant of refugee status would therefore be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary has no plans to accelerate the timetable which he announced on th may last year in another place for the phased closure of the -line vhf services of the bbc and the iba <e> <s> these services are reaching the end of their useful life but surveys carried out by the broadcasting authorities have indicated that there are still many small communities which can receive the -line services but which do not receive satisfactory -line uhf services <e> <s> accordingly the closure of the -line <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of research projects are under way with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of community policing <e> <s> while it is too early to draw any firm conclusions there are i understand indications that community policing schemes may have the effect of increasing the flow of information between the public and the police about criminal activity facilitating co-operation between the police and other agencies within the community and improving relationships between the police and the public <e> <s> the extension of community policing schemes is a matter for the operational judgment of individual chief officers <e> <s> they are i know determined to take whatever measures may be appropriate to maintain and strengthen links with all sections of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the force of british telecoms case for further radio channels with which to satisfy the demand for radiotelephones in the greater london area but it will be some time before an additional allocation is possible <e> <s> the radio spectrum required is not available <e> <s> as from next year there will under the relevant international regulations be a new band allocated to the mobile service generally though it will remain allocated also to its present users <e> <s> british telecom is not the only would-be new user of a necessarily limited resource and the needs of all mobile radio users are under study <e>", "<cs> my lords following the decision of the court of appeal to quash mr covills conviction the deputy chief constable of warwickshire appointed a detective chief superintendent from another police force to conduct an investigation into the failure of the prosecution to supply certain statements to the defence <e> <s> the investigation was concluded on th september this year <e> <s> the investigating officers report is now being considered by the director of public prosecutions who has been asked by the deputy chief constable to advise whether any criminal offence has been committed by any person connected with the prosecution of mr covill <e>", "<cs> my lords the commonwealth immigrants act was introduced following the large increase in the previous few years in the number of commonwealth citizens coming to this country to work or to settle <e> <s> since further measures have been necessary to limit the numbers coming here for settlement in line with our capacity to receive them <e>", "<cs> my lords all forces in great britain have made some provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to be able to support this amendment put down by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> i regret that it was not possible for me to communicate with the noble lord until this morning <e> <s> i think that if i had been a little quicker off the mark then the noble lord would perhaps have been able to be even earlier into the chamber <e> <s> however we are indebted to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for moving the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords our previous discussions on this bill the last of which took place in committee on nd april have given us an opportunity to consider a number of the fundamental issues which arise in moving towards new legislation to control experiments on animals and have definitely contributed to a wider understanding of the problems and in this i certainly agree with the last words which were spoken by the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> we are therefore indebted to the select committee for its work and to its members particularly to the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord houghton for the impetus that they have brought to the deliberations on the bill albeit may i say in the speeches which they have made in recent months approaching the subject from perhaps rather different directions <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords there is as yet no firm evidence that -year-olds in england and wales wishing to continue in full-time education have not been able to do so though some will not have been able to gain entry to their first choice of course or institution <e> <s> to help local education authorities cater for the growing demand for full-time education from to -year-olds the government are providing for an additional million of public expenditure in great britain in and for further expenditure in the following two years <e> <s> for those young people who do not wish to remain in education or do not get a place at school or college and become unemployed the youth opportunities programme which provides courses of work experience and training has been expanded to places in the current year <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a wide-ranging debate and we welcome to it my noble friend lord stodart who spoke for the first time in your lordships house <e> <s> my noble friend has had a distinguished career in another place as both a scottish minister and an agricultural minister and he spoke today of the forthcoming bill to implement the conclusions of the report of the committee of inquiry into local government in scotland <e> <s> it is a rare opportunity for a noble lord to be enabled to make a maiden speech in this house on the report of a committee of which he has been chairman <e> <s> it was a pleasure to listen to my noble friend and i am sure we all hope that he will return soon to speak again not perhaps confining himself to the interesting subject of local government in scotland but possibly branching out into rather wider areas <e>", "<cs> my lords no such order has been made by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor under section of the public records act but records of proceedings before the advisory committee set up to consider b cases are included among those retained by the home office under section of that act on security grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision of protected accommodation is a matter for the various services themselves which have a statutory duty to maintain due functioning in the event of war <e> <s> the bbc has provided protected accommodation for a small number of staff who would operate the wartime broadcasting service <e> <s> british telecom has made provision for the protection of key staff against radioactive fallout <e> <s> the gas and electricity industries have made no provision of protected accommodation <e> <s> any arrangements made by the cbi and tuc would be a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the noble earl lord longford concerns the grave situation in our prisons and that the situation is grave is not in dispute <e> <s> indeed i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon who at the beginning of his speech said in essence that the problems are both pressing and serious <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the home secretary has taken the lead in the past two-and a-half years that he has been in office in drawing public attention to the problems faced by the prison system <e> <s> in speech after speech both in another place and elsewhere my right honourable friend has referred in the plainest terms to the appalling difficulties created by overcrowding and by a legacy of neglect which produced no new closed prison or borstal built in england or wales in the years from to <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no plans at present for introducing in england and wales or in scotland the changes recently made in the prison system in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords responding to an emergency call is a vital part of the role of the police fire and ambulance services <e> <s> the government have the highest regard for the work that they do <e> <s> but the demands made of each service in responding to emergencies and to their other responsibilities are quite different and call for different professional skills in which each service is trained <e> <s> the important thing is that these services should work together wherever necessary and the government are satisfied that there is close co-operation between them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i welcome the opportunity which is afforded by the debate on this second reading to discuss the role and function of the private security industry in this country which does important work in preventing crime and protecting property <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord willis and the noble lord lord boston of faversham made clear that they recognise that good work <e> <s> but of course the effect of the bill reflects in part the concern which is felt and indeed the noble lord lord willis expressed this in his speech about the rapid growth of the industry and the opportunities it could offer for criminal activity <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston reminded your lordships that the previous government issued a discussion paper on the possibilities for controlling the industry and a large number of replies were received from a wide cross-section of interests and they were all carefully considered by the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords it would he for the regional commissioner to decide through the commissioners of justice of emergency courts on sentences appropriate to the offence in the prevailing circumstances and to decide on the use of the statutory power to direct labour <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government are aware of some instances in which the performance of particular cartridge type powder fire extinguishers has proved inadequate no evidence has been brought to their attention which would appear to warrant alerting the public generally on grounds of personal safety or depriving them of the use of these extinguishers by prohibiting their supply under the consumer safety act <e> <s> the government do not consider that a case has been made out for forbidding their use on farms or in other workplaces under the health and safety at work act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> at the end of the second world war fire-fighting functions were taken out of the hands of the national fire service and returned to local authorities by the fire services act <e> <s> section of that act permitted the secretary of state to establish and maintain a central training institution for providing courses of instruction in matters relating to fire services <e> <s> section required that any central training establishment which might be set up should be under the general direction of a board <e> <s> such a board was set up and is known as the fire service college board <e> <s> it is the purpose of this bill to abolish this board <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the initial effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue of royal warrants of appointment whereby tradesmen who supply goods and services to her majesty and other members of the royal family are authorised to display the royal arms or the arms of other members of the royal family is the responsibility of the lord chamberlain and the royal households and is not a matter on which it would be appropriate for the government to express a view <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent report by the home affairs committee of another place on the operation and effectiveness of the commission for racial equality included recommendations relating to the commissions powers to give grants <e> <s> the government are considering these together with the committees other recommendations and will publish their response as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i will reply in a little more detail when i come to make my contribution to the debate <e> <s> contrary to what my noble friend lady trumpington has assumed from what she has gathered from the tape the home office ministers felt that it would be treating both houses with proper respect for my right honourable friend the home secretary to make an answer to a question in another place at the same time as i was taking part in this debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the broadcasting complaints commission is responsible for regulating its own procedure and it would not be appropriate for the government to seek to influence the commission as to the way in which it discharges its responsibilities <e> <s> but i know that the commission is determined to deal fairly with the complaints it receives and that with that object in mind it keeps its procedures under review <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the broadcasting act now section <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans for such an amnesty <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the sponsorship by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran of the personal bill two years ago to which the noble lord made reference it comes as no surprise that the noble lord is promoting this bill to enable the courts to relax in individual cases and subject to certain conditions the general prohibition of the marriage of step-parents with step-children <e> <s> incidentally this bill does not deal with the case of step-grandparents or of sons- and daughters-in-law a matter to which in his very persuasive speech the noble lord lord lloyd did not refer <e> <s> the point to which the noble lord most certainly did refer and which of course has elicited <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendation by the butler committee which this amendment seeks to introduce was naturally considered very carefully by the government and indeed if i may say so by the previous government <e> <s> the recommendation that psychopaths should be detained in hospital only where there was a good prospect of benefit from treatment was accepted and has of course been introduced in respect of hospital orders for psychopathic offenders by means of clause <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not think that new legislation is necessary <e> <s> what this tragic case has shown is that the organisers of disaster appeals need to be fully aware of the financial and legal consequences to the beneficiaries of establishing either charitable or private trusts and the government are preparing suitable guidance for the legal profession banks and other bodies <e> <s> the charity commissioners are always prepared to give advice to appeals organisers about the establishment of charitable trusts as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady wootton has with her usual clarity and persuasiveness urged the merits of the proposals in this personal bill in the light of the circumstances of the particular case <e> <s> as the noble baroness has reminded the house in parliament passed the edward berry and doris eilleen ward marriage enabling act so as to enable a legal marriage to be contracted between mr berry and mrs ward who were related to each other as step-parent and step-daughter <e> <s> on that occasion my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor explained that while it is entirely proper for a minister to address the house on a personal bill of this kind the government collectively adopt a neutral position on the merits of an individual case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords our records for the years from to show that prisoners and staff suffered cuts burns or other injuries as a result of cell fires <e> <s> we do not have information collected centrally about injuries resulting from other fires <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the irish authorities <e> <s> both the last two governments however affirmed their intention of introducing legislation to enable united kingdom citizens to vote at elections to the dail <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is very conscious of the importance of education and training in prison rgimes and everything possible is being done to maintain the high standards of these services <e> <s> in view of the current constraints on public expenditure however he cannot give the assurances the noble lord seeks <e> <s> nevertheless the considerable investment in prison education and training of recent years and the current levels of expenditure will ensure that these services continue to make a valuable contribution to prison rgimes <e>", "<cs> my lords the prototype of the carbodies cr which is intended to replace the present fx early in was unveiled on th december <e> <s> i understand that considerable care has been given to the design of the driving seat in close consultation with the trade <e>", "<cs> my lords nationalised industries and other public corporations are where appropriate already involved in home defence planning at national regional and local level <e> <s> county civil emergency planning officers are encouraged to work directly with the local representatives of public sector organisations and in general there is good co-operation at this level but the final responsibility for home defence planning in these organisations lies with the sponsoring department <e> <s> following the home defence review in good progress continues to be made in improving the state of preparedness of the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to my noble friend lord renton for introducing this debate today and especially because in his speech my noble friend and indeed the speeches of the noble lords lord elystan-morgan and lord wigoder showed very clearly that the problems of crime must be met and must be anticipated on a variety of different fronts <e> <s> when the government came into office we were committed by our manifesto to support the police to keep securely in custody those who are a danger to the public to provide a wide enough range of sentences to enable the sentence of the court to fit the crime and we made clear our recognition of <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow others of your lordships in beginning by congratulating my noble friend lord nugent on his initiative in introducing this bill <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation of the maiden speech made by the noble viscount lord buckmaster <e> <s> after his career in the foreign service the noble viscount is well qualified to say how the standards of obscenity and decency in this country strike someone returning from abroad <e> <s> in his speech the noble viscount did exactly that with considerable effect it was a speech which made a very valuable contribution to the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> it might be convenient if commented on the two amendments which the committee is discussing because my noble friend lady trumpington was good enough to express appreciation for help with the drafting <e> <s> on second reading the noble lord lord jacques drew attention to certain deficiencies in the drafting of my noble friends bill particularly references to parts of the act which are to be repealed as well as references to parts which would remain if the bill were enacted <e> <s> the point was reinforced by my noble friend lord mottistone along with the suggestion that the government might give my noble friend help with drafting should she wish to have such help <e> <s> the amendments follow discussions i had with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords under the criminal injuries compensation scheme for great britain and the similar statutory scheme for northern ireland payments of compensation from public funds can already be made to persons who sustain personal injury and to the dependants of persons who die as a result of crimes of violence <e> <s> throughout the united kingdom the criminal courts have wide powers to order convicted offenders to pay compensation for any personal injury loss or damage resulting from their crimes and in the criminal justice bill we are seeking to strengthen and clarify these powers in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no present plans to amend the race relations act <e> <s> discrimination on the grounds of religious belief is not unlawful in great britain unless it constitutes indirect racial discrimination under the race relations act <e> <s> even then an advertisement imposing a requirement that prospective partners in for example a medical partnership must belong to a particular religious faith may not be unlawful if that requirement can be justified <e>"]
