["<cs> as always i admire the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for acknowledging parentage of even extraordinary arguments like legitimate and illegitimate discussions <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to say with the utmost respect that he should realise the comparative difficulties of an advocate nobody knows of those difficulties and nobody has taken advantage of them with greater skill in the past than the noble and learned lord chancellor in endeavouring not to show that a discussion was legitimate but that the discussion for which he was responsible and where there was only incidentally a risk in regard to current proceedings was in good faith <e> <s> i would regard it as <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in most decent families when the family silver is distributed it is not sold to members of the family <e> <s> it is given to them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton who has a very definite memory and imagination can i think envisage if his amendment is passed another allowing nine months or months will presumably come forward at report stage having a different kind of notice displayed namely one saying closing down sale of indecent exhibitions buy early we are closing in six months time <e> <s> that is a situation which i do not think this committee would like to see <e> <s> i would have thought that a three-months term here was a very proper and appropriate one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i remind him of the last point which i made which i thought had some relevance and importance especially to this bill namely the commencing date on which the provisions of the bill come into effect <e> <s> i reminded your lordships that under schedule to this bill a number of provisions are brought into force on royal assent <e> <s> bearing in mind that it cannot be very urgent that the bill be brought into effect within a matter of days of the royal assent would he give consideration to the general point i mentioned as well as the specific point in relation to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the marbles must have been removed while homer was nodding and therefore is it not completely fair play <e>", "<cs> in fairness because the noble baroness always wants to be fair the people responsible for the amendments as i understand it were informed of the groupings <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas has down a number of amendments <e> <s> he was informed <e> <s> the opposition front bench were informed <e> <s> we were treated with the courtesy of a telephone number if we had any views on it <e> <s> this is the usual procedure as i understand it and i am sure that the noble lord lord mottistone who occasionally uses language that he sometimes regrets and apologises for would wish not to continue using words like dragooned when they are quite unnecessary and completely inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be superfluous to the lawyer and it may be superfluous to the ardent student of this important bill <e> <s> however one must remember that although a court has the guidance of a clerk it is very important for the court to know precisely what parliament intended <e> <s> the words here are as appropriate <e> <s> it is left at that <e> <s> in other instances we have decided that it is sensible to spell out what we mean by the word appropriate we then go on to say what the court has got to be satisfied about <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> the last thing i want to do is to burden him with a technical argument <e> <s> it would be completely unfair and i do not think your lordships would greet it with great approbation at this hour <e> <s> can he say that it is certainly the governments intention that documents should be protected if they come under the common law privilege of documents which are between a legal adviser and his client <e> <s> if he could say that it is the governments desire that that is so and their belief that that is so it would help in view of what i was trying to say before in an effort not to impede the progress of this bill <e>", "<cs> that is taken with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the noble lord the minister that no fur coat passed <e>", "<cs> my lords not only your lordships house but the law society which campaigned in this matter and indeed on the last matter that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed one moment <e> <s> all i was saying was that when the learned lord chief justice referred to the question of the possible disadvantages of the law at the moment his attention was not so far as i understand it drawn to the fact of a later act which made the current position rather better <e> <s> that was my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must return to the dispatch box in view of a comment which was made by the noble lord lord wigoder which if i may say so was neither worthy of him as a member of this house nor as a member of a very honoured profession in which we are taught to be careful with our language <e> <s> from this front bench my colleagues and i have on all occasions praised the police admired their courage and stood by them <e> <s> however that does not preclude a proper investigation when justice and the freedom of the subject is involved <e> <s> there was only one thing that i wanted to say to the minister and then i shall sit down <e> <s> i promise that this is the very last time that i shall speak from this dispatch box on this matter <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the terms of reference he will find that an investigation into what happened at the special branch and its supervision of the matter is excluded <e> <s> i merely ask the noble lord to look at the matter with his right honourable friends to see whether that is proper <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am not happy but the committee does not exist in order to make me happy <e> <s> i feel that there is a difficulty here where there is an urgent need to obtain a warrant and where it may be very difficult in the circumstances time may be of the essence to convince a perfectly able police constable who i am sure would want to take a very full note and then apply to his superior for authority as to whether information should be sworn <e> <s> this shows little faith in the justice of the peace who would not issue a warrant unless it were proper for him to do so unless one takes the view of a justice of the peace that a constable has only to appear before him and he will automatically do it which again is not complimentary to the justice of the peace <e> <s> but i see that there is division in the committee and from a learned source as well <e> <s> i do not intend therefore to press the matter at this stage <e> <s> i ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in attempting to wind up this interesting and extremely important debate on behalf of the official opposition it is my earnest hope and that of my friends that consideration of the white paper before us will lead to an enactment which could have the support of all parts of your lordships house <e> <s> it has been an interesting and important debate because of the participants and the speeches which have been made with great authority not least that of the maiden speech of the noble lord lord armstrong of ilminster <e> <s> my hope will be achieved if the government live up to what they have said both in this house through the noble earl lord ferrers when he so lucidly introduced the debate and what was said on friday last by the minister for the home office when he concluded the debate that took place in that house <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i risk the impatience of the house but it is vital that the noble and learned lord tells us whether between the beginning of may which is the latest date for the receipt of representations on the green papers and the statement to be made before the summer recess he will enter into consultations with the judiciary and the two professional bodies to see whether some consensus can be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may pour a little oil upon waters which my noble friend has made rather more troubled than perhaps they need be <e> <s> the house is united on one thing that when we examine legislation and act as the house that is responsible for revising legislation we do our job properly and see that what passes through the house is what is intended by the house in the best interests of the nation <e>"]
