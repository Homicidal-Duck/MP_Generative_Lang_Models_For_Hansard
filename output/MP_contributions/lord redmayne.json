["<cs> before the noble lord embarks upon his argument i wonder whether i may say something about the practical aspect of the debate <e> <s> i sympathise with noble lords opposite in trying to make the most of a very good political occasion but i wonder whether they realise that the amount of parliamentary time available to the government in this session is very limited <e> <s> at the most there are practical days or perhaps right to the end of the session and if noble lords succeeded in overloading the bill by putting in more contentious matter that would simply lead to a situation in which in the end the bill would fall <e> <s> i do not think that anybody would greatly worry in that it can all be put into the bill but it seems to me that noble lords opposite are playing the game rather unwisely <e> <s> the bill seems to be a long way away <e> <s> i take it that that bill will be included in the queens speech which is within or parliamentary days <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that is not good enough unless and i hope my noble friend will not be short-tempered it means that from royal assent a company can use both names <e> <s> it is all very well to say that six months will be allowed for changing stationery and so forth <e> <s> i had experience of doing this in a company some or years ago and it is an extremely expensive business which takes time <e> <s> any company which applies for a simple nominal re-registration from the old style to the new should be permitted to put the new style into use as soon as it has made the application for registration and then possibly a period of six months will be enough <e> <s> but if my noble friend cannot agree to that then i am afraid we must press this on another occasion <e> <s> this is a matter of being practical it is the first practical point we have had tonight i am not being rude about the opposition but this is something which affects this bill now <e> <s> we must get it right or we shall cause industry a great deal of unnecessary expense just for the sake of legislation <e>", "<cs> that is giving me my point <e>", "<cs> may i please intervene <e> <s> my noble friend had not said that both titles would be admissible during the months and the statutory six month thereafter <e> <s> if you say that then all is well <e> <s> it is not so easy <e> <s> take a large retail company with branches it is not so easy to distribute new stationery i am not talking about goods right throughout that chain in only months <e> <s> there has to be some latitude and it is such a small point <e> <s> i see nothing in it <e>", "<cs> so did i <e>"]
