["<cs> my lords may i say that i am very pleased indeed that the noble lord lord ardwick made such a notable contribution i think i am right in saying that he is the first speaker who can claim to speak with great authority on behalf of the press <e> <s> he disowned any official mandate in that behalf and i must do the same <e> <s> i was for some seven years the chairman of the newspaper publishers association <e> <s> i have ceased to be but i still have a nostalgic and sentimental regard for my previous associates and i must confess to a slight disappointment that they are so ill-represented here this afternoon <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord gibson who i have no doubt will make a valiant and worthwhile contribution but when i think of the number of members of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i grow older it becomes increasingly depressing to see how difficult it is for me to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset declare an interest <e> <s> i have been on the executive of the british council since and i have for some years been deputy chairman <e> <s> i am not here to speak formally on their behalf but i have been asked to speak and i do so with great willingness because if there is one thing which is very necessary it is that some words should be spoken by someone officially associated with the council to improve the morale to which these proposed cuts have obviously done damage as far as the staff is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not think it discourteous to the very courteous and detailed reply that he has given if i ask to be permitted to correct one impression that might be very unfortunate <e> <s> he gave the impression that the council had co-operated in relation to the cuts with a degree of enthusiasm that might he described as almost masochistic <e> <s> i hope he will allow me to say that the council which regards itself as a law-abiding body of course conformed to the directions that it received but at all times made dignified and strong protests against what it believed to be unjustifiable cuts <e>", "<cs> if i may briefly intervene i am totally in agreement with what was said by the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> this clause relates only to new tenancies and therefore i think that the very warm-hearted deprecations of the noble lord lord janner are not relevant <e> <s> i am not in agreement with the noble lord lord janner in smelling sulphur in every clause of this bill which i think is a well-intentioned one and in parts even intelligible <e> <s> that is a matter for complimenting the draftsmen <e> <s> but think that this consideration ought to be taken into account the purpose of this clause is to make available a greater amount of accommodation for letting and it may do that <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question before we divide <e> <s> the noble baroness has indicated her intention to divide and i must say it will <e>", "<cs> without wishing to repeat what the noble baroness has said i should like to urge the government to consider this on the purely administrative considerations that she advanced <e> <s> i should declare a special interest here for i am the president of the rent officers association and as such i have a good knowledge of rent officers <e> <s> i understand that at their last conference at which i made a short address there was a move to reduce their number <e> <s> i wonder whether the government will consider what the expenses involved in this earlier and more frequent rent review will be as opposed to any increase in rents that might benefit the landlords <e> <s> i have a feeling that if it were to be worked out it would be found that a very considerable amount of administrative expenditure is involved <e> <s> it is disheartening to the rent officers <e> <s> already they have to deal with a considerable backlog <e> <s> i think that the government ought to give it further thought and consideration on that ground alone <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may with temerity and diffidence venture a suggestion <e> <s> the rent officer is vested with total discretion on much more important matters than the question of when the new rent is to start <e> <s> would it not be a complete solution to leave it to the rent officer to determine from what date the new register is to start on the basis it does not start earlier than the application <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought to explain that the self-sacrificing abstinence of the noble baronesses on the previous amendments was owing to the fact that logically if the two amendments that they have put down had been discussed and subsequently as i hope my own amend <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to answer that question <e> <s> there are situations where the continuation of a controlled tenancy must bring some injustice to a landlord particularly if he is conscientious <e> <s> it would be thoroughly bogus and hypocritical to pretend otherwise <e> <s> if however one considers the matter on a question of balance there is an overwhelming balance in favour of retaining controlled tenancies <e>", "<cs> with the leave of your lordships i should like to make two very brief points <e> <s> the first point concerns the question of the period of time over which the wastage will take place <e> <s> i do not think that it is of great importance if this situation continues for a great many years and if there are a few wretched tenants continuing to survive in these circumstances year after year <e> <s> i cannot think that that will cause the country to be profoundly disturbed or injure our economy in any way <e>", "<cs> lam very conscious of the warning we had that a protracted debate might endanger our dinner though noble lords will probably agree that i am the person who has least to fear from that situation <e> <s> this is a matter of great constitutional importance <e> <s> we are tampering and threatening to tamper with something that is one of the prizes of our life in this country that is the right to say what one wants to say when one wants to say it subject to the limitations of the law <e> <s> this is a most dangerous matter and one that we must view as having very great importance <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder <e>", "<cs> i would regard it as highly courteous <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could he deal with one matter raised by the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> how would he justify providing a remedy for one medium alone when there is no remedy as regards literature films the theatre or any other medium <e> <s> how would he justify that <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with the question of the right to protect the reputation of the dead no such right exists in any other medium <e> <s> that is the matter that we are discussing at this moment <e> <s> it does not concern the previous discussions it is the question of whether a right should be given to relatives and other people to seek to vindicate the reputation of a dead man <e> <s> why should that exist in relation to television and to nothing else <e>", "<cs> i said no such thing <e> <s> i said that if many complaints are made it would create a situation of enormous difficulty to adjudicate on them which is quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> what does he envisage would be the consequences of not fulfilling this requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a very special reason for wanting to intervene in this debate <e> <s> several years ago before the open university was established i was charged with the interesting and important duty of preparing a one-man report about the open university for the then cabinet <e> <s> in that connection i paid a visit first to the bbc and received quite astonishing support and assistance particularly from sir hugh greene to whom the existence of the open university can largely be attributed <e> <s> then i paid a visit to the independent television authority and they told me with great regret that it was not possible for them to find any time at all for the open university because of the demands already existing on their time <e> <s> this is not a belated and posthumous criticism of the situation <e> <s> but i think it emphasises the need for this amendment which seems to me to be wholly innocuous and virtuous and one that will remove from the independent channels the stigma of being a philistine channel <e> <s> it is of considerable importance that this amendment or something akin to it should be accepted and i thought i was justified in intervening because of my own historical experience in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he answer one question <e> <s> is it the case that the independent channel does not broadcast any programmes by the open university and has never done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are in something of a difficulty over this amendment because whether or not one supports it must depend on the fate of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> two quite distinct functions are at present envisaged <e> <s> there is the function at present in the bill which is that the commissioners have to determine whether a person has been unfairly or unjustly treated <e> <s> there is the proposed new function which heaven forbid we should pass that the commission should enter into every kind of consideration relating to violence indecency morality and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can i ask him one question which i regard as being of great importance <e> <s> if there are to be included in the annual reports the complaints that are received will he also take steps to see that the approbation of those programmes about which there are complaints is somehow assessed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my own hope that the invitation extended by the noble and learned lord lord gardiner that this provision should be reconsidered will in fact be accepted <e> <s> i can think of an instance of a person who is unable to make a complaint who is neither deaf and dumb nor blind and that is someone who shall we say <e> <s> has been kidnapped by cannibals <e> <s> i think he might be in a position of great difficulty but i cannot believe that in those circumstances his principal concern would be to have some observation made about him on television rectified by an apology <e> <s> if i may say so i think this is a case where the road to hell is indeed paved with good intentions and hard cases make bad law because clearly the draftsmen have been carried away by a quite unreasonable enthusiasm for the sort of perfectomania that german jurists used to engage in when they wanted every detail tied up <e> <s> it is perfectly clear if i may say so that a great number of absurdities are incorporated into this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the minister has batted absolutely brilliantly throughout the afternoon but he how appears to be taking off into flights of fantasy <e> <s> where are these blind old ladies in obscure villages who will have complaints against the bbc and what will they have to complain about <e> <s> the suggestion of the noble lord lord hooson is sensible because if one receives a reply direct from the broadcasting authority that has much more validity and credence than if one thinks the reply has been winkled out of them by an approach to the commission and it may well be that a great many complaints will be aborted by skilful polite sensible explanations given by the broadcasting authority before the matter goes to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may suggest to the noble lord lord hooson a reason why these hearings should not be held in public <e> <s> if the broadcasting authority is proposing to vindicate what has been said that must involve the bringing of evidence which obviously might entail some rather disagreeable suggestions against the complainant <e> <s> it appears to me to be a rather terrible price to pay where all you are seeking is the publication of an apology that there should be ventilated in public an investigation as to your sexual morality <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but it might be convenient to ask him now about the legality of the letter and whether the view of the solicitor-general is shared by the charity commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin to feel a certain sympathy with the minister <e> <s> the house must be yearning for someone to say a kind word about clause <e> <s> but although i think i am reasonably soft hearted i must resist the temptation <e> <s> he has however his own eminently sweet reasonableness of presentation which can momentarily conceal the rather specious nature of the arguments that he is presenting <e> <s> i am sorry to have to use harsh words but that was very much the effect which was left with me when i heard his speech <e> <s> i do not think that he disposed of the arguments <e> <s> frankly i do not think that he dealt with the arguments <e> <s> i was not altogether surprised and i hope that this will not be regarded as an unfair comment to notice that he read his speech <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with reading a speech except that one suspects the authorship <e> <s> if i smell a faint whiff of sulphur and believe that the bureaucrats whom i suspect are really behind this legislation had much more to do with it than the minister himself that may be an unfair suspicion but it is one that i shall continue to maintain <e>", "<cs> took the oath <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i would venture to ask him a question <e> <s> will he comment on the suggestion hinted at by the noble lord lord renton that specifying a number of particular matters might under what i seem to remember is called a <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may venture to introduce a little reality into this discussion if it is not impertinent to suggest it <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon who has practised law as i have for something over years must realise that it is unreal to suggest that anyone has total choice of his lawyer <e> <s> to begin with the very best solicitors are not on the legal aid panel <e> <s> when i say the very best i mean the most prestigious and certainly the most expensive <e> <s> i think the question of perfection is at the root of a <e>", "<cs> i shall detain the committee only for a few minutes <e> <s> i hope that it will not be regarded as an irrelevant self-indulgence if i say with what enormous pride i heard for the first time the titular head of my faith giving such a distinguished address <e> <s> it is a self-indulgence but it would have been wrong not to say it <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down there is one item of information that i seek which is probably easier to give than the answer to the last question <e> <s> can she tell us what cost would be involved in acceding to the delay sought by this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will recognise that that is an argument and not an answer <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be acquitted of any of the sinister and ulterior motives attributed to the benches on my right <e> <s> i have no wish to prevent this bill from passing <e> <s> i feel strongly that some portions of it are desirable <e> <s> however i have one particular motive for being here today <e> <s> i represent one interest which i believe is greatly endangered and with respect i have to contradict what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said when he suggested that arrangements were advanced and well advanced in many areas <e> <s> in respect of the matters with which i am concerned i have authentic and incontrovertible proof that they are not advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention will be very brief <e> <s> having heard the speeches i am in an even greater state of confusion than usual <e> <s> i am not at all sure at what vice these amendments are directed <e> <s> are they directed to the examiners who set these rather ridiculous questions or are they directed to the unfortunate headmaster at lewes who is supposed to have proscribed discussion <e> <s> was it on the school premises that he caused the offence <e> <s> it seems to me that one needs to be quite sure what was done before one administers historic reproof and parliamentary castigation to the headmaster at lewes <e> <s> there seems to me to be considerable doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to ask the minister to resolve my confusion by telling me what the motivation of the headmaster was <e> <s> was it his objection that there was a rebel group meeting on the school premises or was it more general <e> <s> if it was more general i shall vote for the amendment but if it was that he thought that it would be disorderly to try to arrange for a set of parents to meet and form an opposition group on the school premises i certainly shall not vote for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i apologise for continuing the discussion <e> <s> does any noble lord know his reasoning <e> <s> is it right that we should pass a resolution that amounts to a severe criticism of the headmaster without knowing what motivated him <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the view of the noble lord lord grimond that it is not immediately apparent why this subject appears in the bill <e> <s> on the other hand it was heartwarming to hear the splendid speech of the noble lord every word of which was music in my ears <e> <s> i appeal to the noble lord lord beloff to adopt a slightly more generous view in this matter <e> <s> we have been listening for many hours to a rather arid though desperately necessary discussion on technical matters and to have a distraction of this kind is immensely welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> does he believe that it is wrong for public money to be spent on training children in the arts <e> <s> his speech sounded like that and i believe that he is doing his party a great disservice <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the manuscript amendment which i have not had the opportunity to see <e> <s> it would be helpful if the government could make a statement that it is not their intention that individual oxford and cambridge colleges should be subjected to this provision <e> <s> the noble lord lord adrian has had some indication to that effect and if we could have a similar indication it would be useful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is some years since i had the privilege of addressing your lordships house in formal debate <e> <s> i wish to assure your lordships that i shall not regard myself as being entitled to the time i have lost in the meantime <e> <s> i think that i have some special qualifications which entitle me to speak on this subject <e> <s> i was for some years chairman of the housing corporation <e> <s> i was chairman of the national building agency which is a related office <e> <s> i am president of the rent officers association i can claim to have invented that character <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing in the world that i would do is engage in a debate with the noble baroness for whom i have such a profound admiration that even if i thought that she were wrong i would not say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in addressing ourselves to these self-evident problems which have no political <e>", "<cs> my lords when i came here this afternoon i did so in the obviously mistaken belief that i had suggested this amendment <e> <s> however it is quite clear that there are other rivals to that claim <e> <s> i may say i am only too happy to recognise it as a cross-bench amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wonder whether i may ask him a question which might help some of us in relation to the ultimate outcome <e> <s> will he be good enough to tell us what is the magic of days and why the same magic is not to be found in days or days <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have ventured to intervene in this important debate for which we are grateful to the noble lord lord hatch had i not recently returned from a visit to south africa after an interval of years previously having visited about times <e> <s> so far as one can i know the country well <e> <s> i cannot pretend to have the excellent knowledge of the politics of south africa or southern africa generally enjoyed by the noble lord lord hatch but i hope that i can maintain the same moderate tone as was demonstrated by the two previous speakers <e> <s> a visit to south africa today by a person of nominal sensibility does not leave one in a moderate state <e> <s> it is an abomination to a great number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention will be brief <e> <s> i have come here this afternoon for a limited purpose <e> <s> what i have already heard makes it clear that the debate opens up issues of national and public importance <e> <s> if we were to debate them fully we should be here all night and for the rest of the week <e>", "<cs> that cannot be believed <e> <s> however mr rampton is not present and in his regard i must make an admission <e> <s> some months ago before the inquiry took place i was telephoned by sir ian trethowan the chairman of the television company concerned <e> <s> he asked whether i could suggest a leading counsel who might participate in the inquiry <e> <s> i thought hard and long and finally suggested mr rampton <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that i rendered him no service and i should like to make a public apology to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to associate myself with the congratulations to the noble lord lord annan for having raised this matter <e> <s> i also feel that the house can feel complacent and happy that it has found time to discuss something of great national interest <e> <s> it is not really a matter that admits of party division <e> <s> i have heard nothing here this evening that really addresses the matter that occurs to me as the major subject of complaint that is the nine individuals who have been disgracefully treated <e> <s> that appears to be the matter to which we should address ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> since an interpretation is being put on what i said perhaps i may make it absolutely clear that i am concerned only about the way the people in question were treated <e> <s> it is not a question of whether the trustees are well equipped to deal with museum problems it is a question of whether they are well equipped to deal with human problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to make a second speech but i did not mention a businessman in the course of my speech <e> <s> i welcome well-informed businessmen because they know how to treat their staff <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and having regard to the hour can he tell the house whether at this fateful meeting the trustees were told that the employees concerned would have their employment terminated on this sort of notice <e> <s> they would have days in which to make a decision and they were not told of the alternative that if they refused to accept redundancy they would have their employment terminated <e> <s> the noble lord has given if i may say so a masterly dissertation on the nature of the museum but he has not addressed himself to the matters that trouble me <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say who gave that extraordinary advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be exceptionally cautious about what i say this afternoon because some of my social life may depend on it <e> <s> for example i have been invited to attend a grand night at one of the inns of court next week and i should very much regret it if that invitation were withdrawn as a result of any observations which i may make today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask my noble and learned friend whether he had read a work called <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the minister appreciates that the motives behind the question are extremely benevolent and kindly <e> <s> i am sure that everyone here will be reassured by the emphasis that she places on the arts council having the obligation to look after artistic institutions <e> <s> the best service that the government can do for the english national opera and many other artistic institutions is to provide them with enough money to do the job properly <e> <s> the minister probably agrees that although not intended the question contains the hint of the dreadful prospect that someone thinks that we should have a ministry of culture <e> <s> she would probably agree that that is the most horrible thing that could happen to the arts <e>", "<cs> i agree with every word that has just been spoken <e> <s> i think that this is an unfortunate amendment <e> <s> it imposes a legal obligation to do something that has been done from the motive of generosity <e> <s> it has been the proud boast in this country that no man would fail to find someone to plead his cause however distasteful that course may be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset say how grateful i am to the noble lord lord rees-mogg for suggesting that this discussion should take place <e> <s> it is a discussion of considerable importance and the fact that our benches are not full of people avid to discuss it is a disappointment <e> <s> many years ago when i was chairman of the arts council one of my few principles was that an essential freedom of any englishman was freedom from culture <e> <s> if i may say so that is sometimes unhappily reflected in the composition of our chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at the outset how deeply grateful i am for the speech just made by the noble lord lord callaghan of cardiff <e> <s> it deals to some extent with the problem raised by the noble lord lord beloff who showed a good deal of courage in expressing his suspicion regarding the motivation of some of the people opposing the bill <e> <s> i have no evidence to support that i should like to think that there is no evidence to support it but it would be closing ones eye to the reality not to believe that a certain amount of anti-semitism is to be found in a number of them <e> <s> however it would be going too far to suggest that that is a reason for ignoring the other considerations against the character of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i must apologise <e> <s> one thing is not yet obvious <e> <s> if one suffers from a disability which makes it difficult to get to ones feet one has very little chance of speaking in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk has made every point that needs to be made in opposition to this bill <e> <s> the bill is something of a mystery to me <e> <s> the government have pursued it with an iron determination and must have some motivation that has not been expressed in this house <e>"]
