["<cs> i should like to support the noble viscount lord thurso and at the same time to declare an interest as i am a fish farmer of some size <e> <s> i shall not cover any of the points which the noble viscount has covered so eloquently and so well <e> <s> i am a farmer as well as a fish farmer and to one who is a farmer it is quite obvious that fish farming is an extension of husbandry there is no difference at all <e> <s> it seems quite illogical that just because fish farming has come into being since it should not be treated in the same way as other facets of the farming industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks having been forced into accepting such an enormous acreage of amendments all in one go and echo what has been said about lady emmet who was a tremendous fighter for this very new industry <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady masham of ilton on bringing this subject to our notice and on making such a thorough speech <e> <s> i should also very much like to congratulate the noble viscount lord mersey on his first speech in your lordships house <e> <s> he showed great eloquence and a wide range of knowledge and i hope as i am sure all your lordships do that he will join us often and speak on a number of subjects <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend to clarify a point that is troubling me <e> <s> if an owner is approached and has a discussion about the notification of a certain area and for reasons of his own which he thinks are right he does not want to have it notified what happens then <e> <s> i thought it was in that situation that the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley wants some form of appeal <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> it is not just a question confined to the law <e> <s> all the arguments in support of this amendment have probably been covered and i too should like to support it <e> <s> in my part of the world where there are a great number of rights of way through farmland on which a great many sheep are kept there are people who definitely go down rights of way with long dogs to kill sheep and also hares <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> i think that this amendment would be welcomed by the authorities and to a certain extent by the police as being an added bow to their armoury to prevent this type of crime <e> <s> the excuse always is that the dog got away from them <e> <s> if they are not caught they have lamb for supper <e> <s> i support this amendment and i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will be able to do something about it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment while once more declaring an interest as i derive financial benefit from fish farming <e> <s> i too am a little disappointed with my noble friends answer <e> <s> i am an english fish farmer not a scots or welsh fish farmer and no grants have come my way <e> <s> it has always been my impression and i say this carefully that the industry has done extremely well in england through not having any grants <e> <s> but there is no <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely happy but i am prepared to accept that they will come under the definition <e> <s> i think with my wording they would have come under the definition a little bit more strongly <e> <s> i am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment now that it has been aired and in view of the fact that there is an amendment coming on later which might monitor this particular aspect as it progresses <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment because i cannot conceive of a situation where anyone is more important in a childs life than the parents be they professional or whatever <e> <s> i also follow many noble lords in believing that the parents should know everything about their children <e> <s> speaking as a layman i am thinking of what one might call the true medical aspect if ones child is ill in a medical sense inside the body perhaps rather than inside the mind when one would want to know every detail in order to make a parental decision as to what should be done <e> <s> this hiding away of information behind a professionalism which i otherwise admire very much indeed would in this instance be absolutely wrong <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not know why i picked on days <e> <s> i now realise that days is one day more than four weeks <e> <s> i should hate to use any strong language when speaking to this and will only say that in these circumstances days is almost derisory <e> <s> to start with as the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth has said the post is very inadequate and one can never be sure at what point something is served upon a person when it is sent by post <e> <s> a period of days is also less than the average holiday and the person to whom such a notice might be sent might be away and would return to find it on his doormat <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment simply on the count that the clause seems to give something with one hand and to take it away with the other <e> <s> the right of asking for an assessment as far as i can see does not directly exist at all <e> <s> it is a semblance <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will say that the authorities are reasonable people and that it will not work like that <e> <s> i am sure that at most times she will be right but i believe that it is wrong that this phrase at the end of each clause should be there which takes away this right to request an assessment <e> <s> for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was hoping when i moved this amendment that we would not have to rely on the press and the ombudsman <e> <s> but i am somewhat reassured by my noble friend <e> <s> i still believe that it would be better to have a longer period <e> <s> i see there is a following amendment <e> <s> however in all the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like briefly to support this amendment because i think that somewhere in this bill parents must have the right to see documents otherwise i do not understand how they can possibly be of the real help that they should be to the professionals who apparently although i do not believe that it is always true would wish to withhold this information <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for bringing up this matter again <e> <s> i do not see any reason at all why he should be in any way apologetic because i believe that a subject such as disablement should be brought up about once a year to monitor how things are going along and to see whether there are any new ideas and also to see as one or two speakers opposite have mentioned how money is being spent or not being spent <e> <s> the last time i heard the noble lord speak was in january in the debate introduced by the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> he then made a cheerfully abrasive speech criticising noble lords on the back benches on this side of the house for not in turn criticising enough those who sit on the front benches about the steps they had been taking so far as disablement was concerned <e> <s> i could not really agree with him in that respect <e> <s> almost inevitably in a debate like this we hear a lot of criticism regarding what is not done and it is right that we should but at the same time i think it is quite easy to forget the big steps that have been taken probably because of the people who have already spoken in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i must declare an interest in that i am a fish farmer of i suppose by english standards fairly considerable size and furthermore and this is a point which should be made before speaking about this bill i am a fish farmer who produces fish entirely for food <e> <s> in other words fish that leave my farm leave it dead <e> <s> your lordships will have realised that there are certain prohibitions and restraints on fish farmers within this bill which are a little stronger than they were in the act but they will bear a little heavier on those who sell fish for stocking rivers or lakes than on those such as myself who as i said sell entirely for the table <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble lord lord tryon for giving the bill such a kind and considerate reception slightly critical in places <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord long for putting the governments position so clearly and sympathetically <e> <s> i must admit that i was pleased to hear if i heard rightly that the remaining stages of the bill will be dealt with tomorrow <e> <s> that is very important <e> <s> it is like sitting on a volcano with had diseases abroad and with a growing industry <e> <s> to put this bill back at this stage and not to bring it forward to the statute book would constitute a real danger to the fisheries of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships for long and will not say anything about the last part of the bill <e> <s> i shall look forward to my noble friend lord belsteads notes <e> <s> i am pleased to hear that he felt the drafting might for idiots like me be rather difficult to understand <e> <s> instead i shall keep as practically every speaker has to the two salient clauses and to the availability of farms to let in the future if the bill becomes an act more or less as it stands now <e>", "<cs> i too should like to agree with my noble friend lord kinnoull with regard to the amendment simply for the very good reasons which he and a number of other noble lords have put forward <e> <s> it seems that the wording is superfluous to the bill <e> <s> it seems also that it would lead to imprecise decisions and woolly thinking all round and i think that we should be far better without them <e>", "<cs> there has been a very considerable debate on this matter and i think that most of the questions which have been posed have been answered satisfactorily by members in other parts of the committee <e> <s> therefore i shall be brief in my conclusion but there are some matters which i must mention at least to say who i agree with and who i do not <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which the noble baroness lady david has said is a probing amendment <e> <s> we have lists of the various bits and pieces towards which money might go <e> <s> for my money i like no <e> <s> the integrating in schools of children with special needs in schools simply because since when the special education act was passed so far as i can make out by talking to people children with special needs still have rather a raw deal in our society <e> <s> one of the troubles always seems to me that in our education acts nothing at all is mandatory <e> <s> it is always left to the local education authorities to decide what goes on <e> <s> with great respect to the noble baroness lady cox who has just sat down i think that this might be an occasion where inflexibility would be a good thing just to make quite certain that for once money gets allocated towards these particular people <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must declare an interest as a farmer and as a burner of straw <e> <s> before i start i should like to take up the point that there are various ways of burning straw <e> <s> you can go for a complete burn which is a damaging and very hot affair or you can wait till conditions are a little more suitable a little damper <e> <s> perhaps you will not get the perfect farming answer but you will do less damage <e> <s> i must admit too that i am very conscious as are a lot of farmers that there have been complaints this year <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord melchett i think that last year was a very dry one in my part of the world and there was a dry harvest the year before we do have damper ones <e> <s> but like the noble lord lord john-mackie i had complaints from people this year not i hope because of myself but because of the generality of farmers burning straw <e> <s> the complaints were usually from housewives who said that soot and so on had got into their houses <e>", "<cs> my lords they would be without real knowledge of the subject <e> <s> that would be my worry <e>", "<cs> i too should like to speak briefly in support of this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that universities and suchlike bodies should properly be put aside for special treatment <e> <s> i do not really see why the matter should not be extended further but <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems that at last we have come round after speaking quite rightly for a long time about the tenant and the charities to what i might call the ordinary commercial freeholder who in this instance it seems is going to suffer financially if the tenant enfranchises the landlord so to speak gets at him in that way causing financial loss <e> <s> as the noble earl lord kinnoull has just said large sums of money are involved <e> <s> i am not an expert as he is and as is my noble friend on the front bench on these matters but it strikes me that this would be a very un-english performance <e> <s> it seems to be a gross unfairness <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that if this good performance is to continue it would be helpful for the agricultural industry to have a little more forewarning of the drastic changes in prices quotas and so on that it has suffered this year <e> <s> will he not agree that it is hard to maintain the efficiency that has i think been maintained so far when things happen as they have happened in the farming industry this year <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not feel that perhaps the answer might be to incorporate in prayers in your lordships house a prayer for rain in south wales <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i shall not say much because it has been well covered <e> <s> i was unable to be here at second reading but i read my noble friend the ministers speech <e> <s> he said that the polluter had to pay <e> <s> if there is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> i hope that he will take it away and think about this amendment carefully <e> <s> i am not sure that i quite agree with him that this is so to speak a situation which is being re-established from what would happen anyway but i am quite happy to withdraw the amendment and wait to hear what he has to say at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> after that generous series of remarks from my noble friend i do not think i have <e>", "<cs> as a person who never understands the law i am now even more bemused <e> <s> now that water is land and that land is water it merely shows me that noble lords and others involved in the law are quite capable of standing on their heads and making politicians do so too <e> <s> i certainly take my noble friends word and as i said these are only probing amendments <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i must strike a contrary note here because i find myself not in agreement with either of my noble friends nor with the noble baroness opposite <e> <s> i feel we are treading on rather dangerous ground here controlling exports and telling other countries how to do their own business and how to look after themselves <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i have sympathy with parts of this amendment <e> <s> it has certain faults to it <e> <s> i shall take up a point raised by the noble baroness opposite and say that it is very important that minimums should not be specified so that people can experiment <e> <s> i think a number of noble lords would want to see if they can get the same results using less of the spray <e> <s> i think it would inhibit that <e> <s> the only other thing i would say is that i think that to ask the minister to decide on the timing is very difficult indeed <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment but perhaps not the knowledge to go with that sympathy <e> <s> i feel however that nitrates are in a different category altogether to pesticides and more to do with fertilisers <e> <s> i agree that levels are up to an enormous height <e> <s> i have heard reports of almost dangerous levels of nitrates being brought up from feet below in some chalk aquifers <e> <s> however that has perhaps nothing to do with pesticides <e>", "<cs> i am entirely in sympathy with this amendment but perhaps not as it is written because this licensing is so complicated <e> <s> it seems so complicated to me that it might put people off altogether <e> <s> if you are going to do that i think that with modern machinery and taking the point about the helicopter we could well do without aerial spraying altogether <e>", "<cs> i have listened to my noble friends answer <e> <s> i am not sure who will be kept in suspense over christmas <e> <s> after all we can always bring back another amendment if we wish <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on the lower hampshire avon which is a body of water that is heavily fished the swans are still of more nuisance to the anglers than are the anglers to the swans <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support this amendment in the same way that i supported the equivalent amendment in committee <e> <s> i shall start by saying that part i of the bill is to do with major disasters and so we are really dealing with the kind of disaster that spreads over a large area and which could be of very serious importance to any farmer who is asked to destroy his foodstuffs and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment simply on the principle that this insurance business seems to be a very grey and difficult area which is worrying a lot of us <e> <s> some obligation on the part of the polluter to have insurance would obviously be of some help <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i am not going to press the amendment particularly as i hear that action is likely to be taken under the control of pollution act <e> <s> as for the rest of the arguments i am a land-lubber and i do not understand about tides but i was interested to read in my general researches that the oysters shrimps and so on at brighton are all right whereas in the estuary of the dart they are definitely not all right so much so that certain oyster farmers have had to move their oyster beds elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say that i support this amendment simply because it is something which seems to be on the side of the farmer and to help him to be more competitive in his purchasing <e> <s> naturally the bias both in committee and on report has been on looking at the environment <e> <s> i think that this amendment produces no troubles as far as the environment is concerned <e> <s> if we did not have this rapid clearance it would be against the farmer and i would think that that would be a great pity <e> <s> i think that at times the farmers efficiency and his power to make money out of his land must be taken notice of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very briefly like to support this amendment mainly because as the noble lord lord john-mackie said it is commercially correct to use tank mixes and all the other considerations seem to have been guarded against very adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit to being somewhat disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i can see the difficulties which my noble friend has outlined and i can see also the difficulties outlined by the noble lord lord john-mackie although i feel that the difficulties he mentioned are not insuperable <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment particularly because of those positive elements about which many noble lords including the noble lord lord melchett have spoken <e> <s> it just occurs to me that it is perhaps a bit cumbersome to have a sub-committee <e> <s> i heard the word quango mentioned i think it was in committee <e> <s> perhaps there is a sort of compromise here simply by going back to amendment no <e> <s> which has just been passed reconstituting it in such a way that its terms of reference are widened to cover the points which have been made by many noble lords and widening its constitution in regard to people to include the sort of representation which has also been mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment in the words my noble friend lord stanley has used <e> <s> here again once more it seems that the farmer might incur loss and have no sensible or practical redress <e> <s> that seems wrong <e> <s> i should like to reinforce what my noble friend has said that the whole area of compensation seems at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say that i cannot really see why the local authorities should so to speak he written into the bill <e> <s> we must remember as the noble lord lord mackie has said that we are dealing with emergencies i think that my noble friend said it actually and we are dealing with speed <e> <s> if i may quote the words of the noble baroness she said and she did not like it very much that we are dealing with a narrow and centralised structure <e> <s> i think that in these emergencies this is just the structure that one wants <e> <s> one wants a very efficient narrow structure which will listen to the local authorities <e> <s> i feel quite certain that in the kind of emergencies about which we are talking information will come very quickly and it will come from the local authorities <e> <s> i cannot see the point of writing it into the bill in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak in support of this amendment as i put my name to it <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley has a very strong point and it is one to which as he says there has not as yet been given a clear answer <e> <s> it is one to which i feel there is no clear answer to be had though i should like to think that i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of pressing the amendment <e> <s> quite obviously i want to have another word on the contentious point that lies between myself and my noble friend <e> <s> i was very interested to hear lord parrys arguments in favour of making other people pay for trouble <e> <s> but in truth it must be easier in a restricted area such as the noble lord described <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point in saying any more at this stage <e> <s> perhaps it would be better to move straight on to the next amendment <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely my noble friend has not insured his fish against the circumstances we are talking about now because they have not occurred yet <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend and the noble lord lord john-mackie are right in that this is not the most perfect of all amendments <e> <s> in all probability i shall withdraw it at the end of the day <e> <s> before i do so i must again emphasise that somewhere down the line or at the end of the day the person who has been polluted and who has to destroy his crops his animals or what have you is going to pick up a possibly monumentally large bill which possibly he cannot pay and that will lead to his financial ruin <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friends amendments with a few brief comments <e> <s> one has here a committee of great strength and power but it seems to have an entirely negative series of terms of reference <e> <s> it would seem very right and proper that it should have the power to innovate and to suggest to the minister so that we can be seeking the whole time better ways of doing things for the sake of both the farmer and the environment itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord alport brings these bills before us this is the third one and puts his case with great eloquence <e> <s> many of your lordships may feel that this particular model is not nearly so traumatic as far as farming is concerned as the previous ones <e> <s> but i would suggest that even if that may be so that is no reason why it should ever become an act because i think that it has a lot of undesirable features to it <e> <s> i admit that there has been trouble this summer again much to my sorrow but i think that it was very small compared to previous years <e> <s> once more we had a dry harvest although looking at the noble baroness lady nicol i know that in the eastern counties it was damp because i passed that way at the end of harvest <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i raised all manner of difficulties <e> <s> i think the word i used was cumbersome <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask why she feels that there could be a paper mill to make paper out of straw when practically all the paper mills that make paper out of wood have closed in this part of the world <e> <s> we are sending our timber to norway to have it repatriated as pulp to cash in on the cheap hydro-electric power <e> <s> her proposal does not seem realistic to me <e>", "<cs> i too should very briefly like to say that i could not possibly be happy with this series of amendments <e> <s> there is nothing more that i can add to what my noble friend lord middleton has said because i think he put the question very well indeed <e> <s> i must admit that i am not even entirely happy with the urban situation <e> <s> i have just put it out as a thought that to argue it from the particular of the boltons to the whole urban scene is arguing for a rather special set of circumstances and ones that might be quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like briefly to support the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i really think that for development and planning in farming terms months is verging on the ridiculous <e> <s> as my noble friend lord sandford said months is far too short a time <e> <s> both noble lords covered the matter very well so i would add only one thing perhaps for the good name of the farming community <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it might be sensible if the national gallery concentrated more on exhibiting the pictures that it owns rather than on purchasing more <e>", "<cs> my lords on a more serious note is my noble friend aware that there are great differences within the medical world on diet and that any precipitous action taken on the lines of the question originally asked could do damage to certain sections of the farming industry and should not be undertaken lightly at all <e> <s> is she further aware that a little of what you fancy does you good <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for bringing up this enormously wide subject in a short debate <e> <s> i too agree absolutely with the noble baroness lady elliot that there is really no one more competent to do so <e> <s> both he and the noble baroness told us how long they have been farming <e> <s> i can only admit to years so i am really a beginner and probably should not be on my feet at all <e> <s> this is a wide subject and people have tended to talk about various parts of it <e> <s> i am going to try and i have never before spoken in one of these short debates just to touch on all the various facets which the noble lord has included in his motion <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way for a moment <e> <s> the question i really asked was whether the government contemplated any future legislation on fish farms polluting rivers or extraction of water from rivers in relation obviously to the growth of fish farms over the country and employment and so on <e> <s> it was not on the grant question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there was an accidental release of clams in the solent from the queen mary coming back from america that they have multiplied greatly and that they have been of tremendous commercial value to the area <e> <s> is he further aware that these unpronounceable clams now in the exe estuary stand the chance of being killed by tin based anti-fouling paint from the keels of yachts <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because i felt that of this clutch of amendments dealing with the parks and the countryside it was the best <e> <s> i thought for a start that it did not put the government to a great deal of trouble <e> <s> it is merely asking them to tell your lordships house and another place what my noble friend lord stanley has just said what precisely they mean to do <e> <s> by implication that means that i at least am not too happy about what they say they are going to do in clause and schedule because two matters seem to be left hanging <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to take note of the fact that any further delay through tests of a substance having slow release properties will probably take so long to reach a conclusion that the damage done to the smaller organisms in estuaries will be almost irreparable <e> <s> does my noble friend know that the damage to oysters which has been noticed is merely indicative of the death caused to many smaller organisms which are essential to estuarial life <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with noble lords regarding the sluggishness of marine reserves coming forward and being created and i sympathise with what the noble baroness has just said about the rather ponderous procedures that have to be gone through <e> <s> even so we must go back to the amendment itself and see what is the alternative suggestion and this was overriding powers on the part of the minister <e> <s> that was how i understood it <e>", "<cs> unlike my noble friend on the front bench i should like to oppose the proposed new clause <e> <s> i say this somewhat shyly <e> <s> i do not come from north of the border <e> <s> i am a keen salmon fisherman and i was hoping to bring up various points later in our discussion <e> <s> but it seems to me that there are a great <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for bringing these regulations and this scheme before us <e> <s> i cannot possibly say however that i am very pleased with them <e> <s> on the second page of the regulations it is stated that the regulations can be described as agricultural improvement regulations whereas i would describe a large part of them although i have no particular objection to this as environment improvement regulations <e> <s> i was brought up by the late sir frank engledow who described the object of agriculture as to make money subject to the welfare of the workforce and the heart of the land <e> <s> this seems rather a long way from it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would just make it quite clear that it is impossible to claim an agricultural pond put fish in it and claim the higher rate of grant <e> <s> that was really my question because it is a farm pond so why cannot one claim the higher rate of grant rather than the per cent <e> <s> that is what i do not quite understand <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall be as quick as i possibly can be <e> <s> in point of fact after the very good debate that we have had there is little left to be said and i myself view the whole question in fairly simple terms <e> <s> before i say anything more i should like to compliment the noble lord lord plowden and indeed the whole of his committee on this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too start by expressing appreciation of our chairman the noble lord lord gallacher for leading us through this labyrinth of technicalities and for drawing the information so carefully from the various people whom we interviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord gallacher on the report and also thank the noble and learned lord lord templeman for allowing members of sub-committee d to attend his committee and listen to the deliberations on the milk outgoers scheme <e> <s> at the same time my noble friend lord monk brett on has asked me to apologise to your lordships because he too like another noble lord had to leave not anticipating that the business before the house before this debate would go on for quite so long <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am immensely grateful for this very opportune question which the noble lord lord taylor has brought before us and very grateful too that the question has been asked quite bluntly about the possibility of privatisation of the whole of the forestry commissions woodlands <e> <s> i have always felt that the forestry commission was divided up into three different parts the first being those outlying woods which i assume come into the figure that the noble lord lord taylor mentioned that are being sold off at the moment <e> <s> i always believed that that was probably the right thing to do and that they should fall back into private hands <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the question of surpluses and replacing with woods those acres that might go out of production does my noble friend really believe that that is a practical proposition <e> <s> we are talking of farmers and surely there is a very severe cash flow situation for them unless once more the government or brussels are prepared to subsidise the whole situation very strongly indeed and as my speech brought out those subsidies seem to be getting eroded <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend the minister on putting this bill before us so clearly <e> <s> to me it is rather like a farming rotation it darts from subject to subject and it is intended indeed it is to be in keeping with the times and with what one wants to be accomplished <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendments <e> <s> i think that it is very important at this stage to inject some certainty into the future of adas for the reasons that have already been given <e> <s> this is needed not only to help morale which i think everyone now knows is very low but also and perhaps even more importantly because in fact adas has a very real future <e> <s> i myself am quite sure of that and perhaps it will be brought out later in the proceedings when we are discussing other parts of this bill <e> <s> notwithstanding private consultancy firms and other advisory bodies of that nature i think that at this stage we ought to put certainty into the future of adas and i very much hope that my noble friend will see the importance of this <e>", "<cs> i think that this amendment should be resisted though i am not in any way against organic farming or the pursuit of research into that subject <e> <s> i believe that it should not be put into statute in the same way that water should not be in statute <e> <s> it is possible for advice to be given within the bill as it stands <e> <s> it would be a pity to include research specifically because i do not believe as perhaps do some noble lords opposite that organic farming is a subject on its own <e>", "<cs> i tried to cover that question but obviously did so very badly <e> <s> there is a feeling that when adas charges it will be moving into a different sphere of advice <e> <s> it is also i believe thinking of a specific target to be earned in <e> <s> whereas previously it would be happy to pass on a client at a certain stage to a private consultant for detailed work adas now feels that it will be doing the detailed work as well <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving the various assurances that he has given and indeed the last one to which my noble friend lord melchett referred <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support my noble friend lord middleton and bring down if necessary the kiss of death and all sorts of things upon my head though i should like to remind the committee of the quotation which the noble lord lord middleton made which came from the president of the dairy farmers association and seemed to favour his approach to the question rather than many of the other ones that have been produced <e>", "<cs> there is one very small point which i think should be made but has not been made <e> <s> i agree with everything that my noble friend on the front bench said and i would not want the law altered so quickly after it has been made <e> <s> the point i make is that if the law is made too hard for farmers they will fence off the rights of way <e> <s> i cannot think of anything more unattractive to a rambler or anyone walking through the countryside than a footpath which is very narrow or a bridlepath which is not very wide fenced off with barbed wire or plain wire <e> <s> that has been done and if matters become so bureaucratic so complicated and so aggravating as has been suggested in the face of <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to think of two sponsored walks meeting head on between two electric fences each group consisting of or people <e> <s> i wonder how they would manage to get past each other <e> <s> that is the kind of situation of which i am thinking <e> <s> i think it is thoroughly undesirable to fence in rights of way in the countryside from a visual point of view and from a practical point of view so far as concerns the ramblers and we always talk about ramblers and anyone else who wants to walk across the countryside <e> <s> rights of way were originally not made only for ramblers but for everybody including hearses and coffins and so on <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord peel i have no intention of dividing the committee although i might reserve the right to bring forward <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> if we are going to have esas then obviously it would be a tremendous miss not to monitor them to learn from them and to make them work properly <e> <s> i enter this debate only to remind my noble friend on the front bench of an amendment of mine on monday just before we all went home which was to expand subsection <e> <s> if we are going to have this amendment no <e> <s> it becomes even more vital to expand subsection to include either freeholders or landowners <e> <s> all through this bill the farmer and the landowner seem to get pushed into the background and here they are completely left out <e> <s> if it was discourteous not to have them in at the beginning of subsection to start the esas it must be stupid not to have them in to help tell how things are going <e>", "<cs> the amendment does say consultation <e> <s> i was thinking of getting their views and making use of the landowners and farmers and not just of the starkness of an agreement <e>", "<cs> briefly i should like to argue with my noble friend lord onslow about this viewpoint as regards trees <e> <s> everyone can have his own opinion about whether they are ugly in large blocks or whether they should be pine or another species <e> <s> i believe that at one time scotland was covered with pine trees and there was a fire and the whole lot was burnt down <e> <s> that is what one speaks of a forest where no trees are <e>", "<cs> i follow the noble lord lord john-mackie by asking whether or not they want rural unemployment <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has said that this is only a probing amendment one should not perhaps take it too seriously <e> <s> if however it is a serious piece of drafting i have to admit that i find it in a way quite repugnant <e> <s> there are two reasons <e> <s> the first is that a person who is subject to a conservation order is allowed to object only and there seems to be no right of appeal <e> <s> the objection has to be lodged with the very people who have ordered how he should conduct himself <e> <s> secondly there seems to be power on the face of it to disrupt a persons business for which that person would get no compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords i perhaps have the advantage that i have not taken part in any conversations or negotiations although i am grateful for a note from my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> i also was interested in this amendment if only because it would get rid of what is there at the moment which is bad legislation <e> <s> but i must admit that i still feel that a mistake is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly against the amendment <e> <s> there is no point in repeating arguments that i put forward at committee stage but i should like just to take up cudgels with the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> while he was speaking i read carefully page of the marshalled list <e> <s> i cannot see that the amendment is anything but a complicated affair both bureaucratically and in practice with notices being posted and signposts being put up for the length of the right of way <e> <s> people would have to be consulted and so on <e> <s> i do not think the wording is a great deal better than last time in that respect <e> <s> i have risen to speak to say just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> it is not simply natural justice it is common sense <e> <s> the assurance given by my noble friend lord belstead that a written declaration would have to be produced and that there would be a standard agreement between the minister and the people involved with farming is not good enough <e> <s> it does not take into account that although the agreement between minister and those indulging in farming on esas may be standard the agreements between the various fanners and their landlords may be very variable <e> <s> that must be taken into consideration <e> <s> i believe that noble lords almost throughout the chamber felt esas to be a good thing <e> <s> they gave the whole principle a great welcome from the second reading onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the regulations are to be made under food and environment acts rather than the pollution act as he originally suggested to me when i first raised this question can my noble friend say whether there is any danger to human beings through the food chain <e> <s> is that the inference we should draw from the change from one act to another <e>", "<cs> i rise to <e>", "<cs> as i have put my name to the second of these two amendments perhaps i might be allowed briefly to speak to it <e> <s> should like to make quite clear that it is the second amendment i favour and not the first <e> <s> the presence of vehicles is of considerable importance and the first amendment is spread rather too widely for my liking <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to add my thanks to my noble friend for being as good as his word and for writing this provision into the bill <e> <s> it is an extremely important one <e> <s> as i said previously the creation of these esas must be smooth and their running must be smooth <e> <s> i could not possibly see without some sort of assurance such as this being written into the bill that that would necessarily happen <e> <s> now i think or at least i hope it will and i am grateful <e> <s> i know that goes for my noble friend lord peel as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my welcome to this amendment <e> <s> i have had practical experience of a hippie convoy <e> <s> it was first of all stationary for a number of years and subsequently a splinter group went to stoney cross <e> <s> it seems to me as the noble lord opposite said that in this instance the government have got it as right as they possibly can that there is in fact a nuisance and that there is no reason why with all the safeguards that are built in that this clause should not be a criminal affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i must oppose the amendment because i think that from the very beginning vehicles were an integral part of many peoples thinking and an integral part of the situation which provoked if that is the right word the original amendment <e> <s> i take many of the points made by the noble lord lord mishcon particularly that we might look extremely foolish by specifying the number and finding that some went on a neighbours land or ran away too quickly <e> <s> that could of course be altered at a later stage in the bill by reducing the number to say one <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that and i fall back on my previous argument that vehicles are an integral part of the situation and shall be left in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> it seemed completely illogical having got so far in the bill to leave these buildings without protection <e> <s> i would go so far as to say that without it they might become more of a prime target than they have been previously if they were so left out <e> <s> perhaps i might add my thanks to the government for their help over this very vexed clause and to my own thanks i would add those of my noble friend lord stanley of alderley who is unfortunately not able to be here today <e> <s> i would strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that towards the end of this long debate it should be noted that those noble lords and noble baronesses who have supported this amendment have not once cited a specific case in which something has gone wrong <e> <s> we have not had our eye drawn to one ill that has to be rectified <e> <s> the whole argument seems to have been rather hypothetical what might happen if there is too much antibiotic in the milk and so on <e>", "<cs> i understand that one is allowed to speak twice on amendments <e> <s> i thought it possible that of the soil could be interpreted as meaning something that could be grown in soil rather than actually grown in soil <e> <s> that would get round the difficulty mentioned by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> it seems to be a matter of definition <e> <s> however i think the matter should be clarified <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i shall leave my noble friend with the thought that i think we have the rights of the matter here <e> <s> it may be better if the directive were somehow altered rather than our thoughts upon the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for bringing this massive subject before us <e> <s> it has caused a lot of trouble to a lot of people over quite a long period <e> <s> whether in a short debate this evening we shall be able to produce the ideas which will lead to its solution i am not quite sure but i think it is excellent that we produce a few ideas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> unlike the bill that we have just been discussing this is a bill of complete simplicity to do with deer farming in england and wales <e> <s> as your lordships probably know deer farming is a small but emerging industry which shows a certain amount of promise <e> <s> there are only about deer farmers in the two countries <e> <s> the industry is hampered by the fact that it is still governed by laws relating to deer in the wild and the killing of them <e> <s> this means that at certain times of the year the deer farmer according to the breeding cycle of the deer is unable to sell venison or any of the by products that go with such farming a quite considerable disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to my noble friend and to the noble lord lord john-mackie for supporting this small short but very important bill <e> <s> i am at a great disadvantage because i did not hear the end of the noble lords question which does not give me a chance to answer <e> <s> he said that there was perhaps scope for something but i did not hear that one word <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for repeating that <e> <s> i suppose it would be wrong to say that there was no scope at all but the ways that deer in scotland have been marked so far <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i think i can put my noble friends fears at rest because there is nothing about abattoir killing in the bill <e> <s> deer will continue to be killed as they are in the wild <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune to be the first to speak after the noble lord lord carter and to congratulate him on one of the best maiden speeches i have heard since i came into your lordships house <e> <s> i have known the noble lord for quite a long while <e> <s> we have discussed farming matters in a non-political context on many occasions <e> <s> i expected nothing less of him and i certainly was not disappointed <e> <s> i am sure that we all hope to benefit from his knowledge even if on this side we may not always agree with his politics <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear from him on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord lord tordoff means by his amendment but it is already written in the bill that rail traffic only is provided for <e> <s> the shuttle is a railway train that goes round and round <e> <s> there will be provision for through trains <e> <s> there is only a service tunnel in the middle and it seems to be entirely immaterial that the shuttle service should be carrying motor cars lorries or what have you <e> <s> it is in point of fact a rail only tunnel <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment but it is a little difficult to expect the channel tunnel company to cope with disabled people <e> <s> the reason is that disability is an immensely broad word <e> <s> the noble baroness pointed out facts about the tunnel which i freely admit filled me with horror including the width of the passageways the handrails and so on <e> <s> however to ask the concessionaires to continue until they are satisfied that everything has been done is at this stage perhaps going a little too fast <e> <s> i do not want to make comparisons with boats aeroplanes and so on because i am sure that everyone is aware that they are there <e> <s> i suggest that later on unless the amendment is accepted something similar but of a more experimental nature be brought forward perhaps suggesting that the eurotunnel authorities to use that dreadful expression use their best endeavours so that little by little we may discover what is and what is not practicable for the disabled <e> <s> i feel that there must come a point when a person with a certain degree of disability must either decide to go through the tunnel or not to travel at all <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment but i do so with considerable trepidation because my involvement is massive <e> <s> it is necessary for me to go into it in some detail so that the committee can judge just where i stand and whether i am biased <e> <s> then i hope i shall be allowed to continue to talk about the principle of this matter at least to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment which seems to have very wide support now <e> <s> i must declare my interest as i did last time although it is a little different now <e> <s> i still own land in folkestone and i formed a trust there some time ago which owns a lot of land in folkestone <e> <s> however since last monday i have signed a contract for the sale of parts of land to which i referred <e> <s> i believe that completion with an amazing amount of hurry on the other side has taken place today so perhaps i can speak with a great deal more confidence and freedom that i did then <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord carter for raising this matter <e> <s> it is important that every now and again we should talk about disability <e> <s> the noble lord has chosen to look into the future with a rather jaundiced glance which i do not have sufficient knowledge to follow <e> <s> but i think it is also important to look back and to see how the laws that have been made in the past are working today <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this enabling bill <e> <s> i am grateful to have a foresight into what the regulations might eventually hold <e> <s> it comes in the face of farming going a little wrong compared with the happier days gone by and in the face of european and world surpluses in commodities <e> <s> the point of it must be to help the farming community survive properly the farmers to stay in business and the workforce to remain employed while at the same time doing something towards reducing those surpluses <e> <s> perhaps we should wonder whether it will achieve those two objectives in any large way <e> <s> i certainly hope that it will <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to everybody who has spoken in this debate both those who are for the amendment and those few who are against it which in a way led us away from the main question and on to other matters <e> <s> i shall certainly not speak for a long time again but i must pick up two points which are important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> she has of course put her finger on a very important part of the amendment which is concerned with communicating the result of any review which takes place <e> <s> i am quite happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that we can perhaps have a word about that and bring something to the next stage of this bill which is satisfactory to everyone <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for obvious reasons i should like strongly to support the amendment and at the same time to thank my noble friend very much indeed for holding consultations with me <e> <s> for a moment i was a little worried by the word may but became totally convinced that this was not a permissive clause but would oblige the minister to review these grants at those intervals of three and five years thereafter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene declaring my interest as a fish farmer to support the broad principles of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i should also issue a word or two of warning about the idea so eloquently put forward by the noble lord lord mason of uniformity throughout the country <e>", "<cs> i put my name to the amendment first because it was a matter of rural business and secondly because this is not so much a question of the intricacies of the bill or past or future rating regimes but more of the decline of important parts of country life <e>", "<cs> i wholeheartedly support the amendment if only because it is so irregular that horses should be left out of the farming scene in this way <e> <s> so far as i know every single form of livestock <e>", "<cs> we have heard this evening that the meat of the horse is used for food <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> it seems logical and sensible that self-catering accommodation should not be domestically rated <e> <s> most people believe that it is used for business and there it should lie <e> <s> it should benefit from that regime which would be more suitable not only to the farmer running his self-catering business to protect himself against ever-increasing hard times but also to anybody who has self-catering accommodation in the town or at the seaside or wherever it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may have the temerity to oppose this set of amendments <e> <s> my temerity is all the greater since i am a derated farmer although i feel that the parallel drawn between charities farmers and the church was not a correct one <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is a simple problem which deserves a simple answer <e> <s> the simple problem has not been stated in so many words <e> <s> it is that the agricultural system will fall down if workers of importance get stranded in cottages which are wanted for the person who would carry on the job which they are no longer doing <e> <s> it seems very inefficient to rely on other parts of the bill which are under some suspicion as both the previous speakers have said when there is such an obvious alternative open which is embodied in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for explaining these regulations so clearly <e> <s> in point of fact they are in essence fairly simple <e> <s> i discard the alternative uses of land as being of only fringe benefit so far as concerns the main objective presumably of this set-aside <e> <s> the main objective a laudable one is to save money being spent on surpluses and to diminish those surpluses by taking land out of cultivation <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point entirely but in the same way the government are having a little experiment i should be quite prepared to have one too if i were given the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the ec limit was set far too high that it is unrealistic and that in many areas in this country it will be completely unattainable <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that there is a large body of opinion in this country which is disappointed that the limit was agreed to at brussels by our government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to speak against the amendment for the reason which has already been so plainly brought out that the type of weapon under discussion should not really even to a small degree be in anyones hands in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking this late in the debate i find it rather difficult to know quite what is left to say <e> <s> it is certainly not easy to follow any preconceived ideas <e> <s> however i intended to say and would very much like to say that it has been a real pleasure and very instructive to work on sub-committee d under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord gallacher <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that from the point of view of the environment it would perhaps be much better if set-aside land were allowed to fall back to nature <e> <s> that is really what we are talking about <e> <s> are there any plans whereby that might be an allowable option rather than just the traditional fallow and green fallow both of which cause a considerable amount of disturbance to plants animals and insects <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can assist my noble friend <e> <s> abandonment of land is what i mean <e>", "<cs> i must go against the amendment <e> <s> like my noble friend lord renton i fear that under this definition some people will be left out <e> <s> i should not have spoken if the education act had not been mentioned <e> <s> the danger under that act is that because of its broadness some people may be left out <e> <s> if i may declare an interest dyslexia is one such case <e> <s> i should hate to see this happen again <e> <s> i agree that this is a much nicer way of putting matters but sometimes to be harsh is to be safe <e> <s> in my view this is such an occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i am very sad that the noble baroness lady nicol is not here to set us off on this journey and i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for starting this debate <e> <s> it has become quite hair-raising <e> <s> it has been global <e> <s> it has been brought to our notice that trees covering an area the size of a football pitch are being felled by the second <e> <s> eight thousand babies are being born each minute or second i cannot quite remember <e> <s> my noble friend presented us with a galaxy of awful ailments that we were likely to catch <e>", "<cs> perhaps we can get back to the amendment as it is written instead of listening to endless second reading speeches which are quite out of place <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am the person who runs that fish farm on the hampshire avon <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether he realises that although i do breach and unfortunately have breached consent on various occasions on a greater number of occasions the water coming into the fish farm has been dirtier than my discharge consent <e> <s> on one notable occasion the last time i think the farm was tested i was deemed to have breached my consent on a fish farm through which no water whatsoever was passing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the bill <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend lord caithness on explaining it so clearly <e> <s> at the same time i thoroughly enjoyed hearing the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey as i always do trying to convince me that the whole idea was a misconception <e> <s> the noble lord quoted joseph chamberlain <e> <s> i think that he was a bad person to quote <e> <s> as the noble lord said he wanted to keep water in the public sector <e> <s> my goodness perhaps it was cheap but what happened to it <e> <s> it was used cheaply <e> <s> people made a great deal of money out of it while at the same time polluting many of our rivers <e> <s> we might now at last be able to start putting matters right <e> <s> it was from that period i believe the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford mentioned that the damage was done <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that they did not succeed <e>", "<cs> i am not in favour of the amendment but i rise to ask a question concerning subsection c which states <e>", "<cs> my noble friend seemed to support us strongly to start with and then backed off <e> <s> the arms length business is of prime importance <e> <s> there may be people on the authority who have regional ties or special knowledge but we are talking about the whole of england and wales <e> <s> there will be plenty of expert people with regional ties to go on the advisory committees without going to the authority to so to speak borrow a person and spoil the whole concept of advice and advice being accepted or not at arms length <e>", "<cs> the point should be made that control by covenant is not nearly so strong as it used to be <e> <s> moreover it is very dependent on the previous owner having influence over whatever is sold and upon which the covenant is held <e> <s> i can imagine that that might not necessarily be the case with a water plc selling on something to someone else indeed it may not have any influence in that particular geographical area <e> <s> therefore if the matter came before the courts it would be found that the covenant was not as valuable as we seem to think it is at present <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord addington has a point but only one the acidification of water <e> <s> i do not go along with any of his other arguments <e> <s> with coniferous forests planted in the wrong place acidification is a matter for consideration <e> <s> acid rain and dead streams especially in wales are a considerable worry <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment for all the reasons which were so well put by my noble friends lord renton and lord middleton <e> <s> what sticks in my gullet is that this provision would override agreements that have been entered into <e> <s> to me that is more important than wells drying up and the unreasonable expense that might be incurred by individuals supplying water privately <e> <s> i do not like the idea of arrangements properly entered into being so to speak blotted out as they appear to be in the clause <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that in the final analysis it is not entirely money that is needed for putting the sewerage plant right as quickly as the noble lord lord mcintosh suggested <e> <s> i am told that there is a logistical problem and that there are not the resources of engineers and plant because so much of that type of labour and executive skill is taken up by the channel tunnel and will similarly be taken up by the fast rail link <e> <s> it is not entirely a matter of money <e> <s> there are very practical considerations to be thought of <e>", "<cs> i briefly support my noble friend lord cranbrook <e> <s> i do not think that we want to keep a <e>", "<cs> indeed i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i am at least partially reassured by the control of pollution act but i am not so sure about the other reason given <e> <s> however i take my noble friends word that all will be well and ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clear up that matter <e> <s> as the noble lord probably knows i am a fish farmer <e> <s> by fisheries i mean a sport fishery and not a fish farm <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not intend to press the amendment but i am not immensely impressed by the reply which my noble friend has been able to give me <e> <s> perhaps i may start at the other end this time with the water meadows <e> <s> it would be quite wrong if anyone whose livelihood depended on the water meadows had to go to the nra to see whether he could support himself in that way <e> <s> that would not be right <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment first on the new clause of my noble friend lady trumpington and secondly on the amendments to <e>", "<cs> i apologise for treading on my noble friends toes <e> <s> i thought that he had formally moved the amendment <e> <s> i do not want in any way to pre-empt what he might say <e> <s> perhaps i may finish by saying that at least this clause must be weighted more towards the farmer and away from regulations made in europe which many people feel are quite unreasonable <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend at some stage or other will be able somehow to strike a balance <e> <s> on one side there are the risks to health which it would seem are very slight indeed <e> <s> the last known blue baby case was in and the other example of cancer of the stomach is suspect and very much in doubt indeed <e> <s> on the other side there is what could be a very awkward situation for farmers and farmland in this country <e> <s> i hope that in some <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord stanley <e> <s> i galloped on a little before dinner and said then what i shall say now only briefly <e> <s> i believe that within the new clause there must be more certainty for farmers in view of the horrendous situation in which they may find themselves <e> <s> compensation cannot be left to a clause as permissive as this <e> <s> there must be a proper recourse to arbitration through the lands tribunal <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support individual notification for all the reasons that both my noble friends have given <e> <s> it is generally acknowledged that this proposal is going to be very difficult for farmers <e> <s> i should have thought that it was very much in the governments interests to notify people individually to do everything straight down the line and as properly as possible <e> <s> i give the amendment every support <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a few words of support <e> <s> i think that in all the circumstances days is too short a period <e> <s> this amendment is very much on a level with the previous amendment <e> <s> the government should consider doing everything they possibly can to keep the farmer informed give him time to think and consult his advisers <e> <s> one cannot help feeling that as some of the nitrates took about years to come down through the chalk aquifers it is a little unreasonable for the government to be in quite such a hurry <e> <s> i give the amendment my greatest support <e>", "<cs> i am a little disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i have looked back hurriedly at clause <e> <s> it provides <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> i am more or less reassured by my noble friends remarks and by the fact that a fish cage may be regarded as a pontoon or something of that type and not as a vessel <e> <s> i note that he acknowledges that the question is tricky <e> <s> i shall be interested to see whether any alteration is made <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the thrust of this amendment but most of it would fill the fish farming fraternity and again i declare an interest with grave forebodings <e> <s> i hope that if anything like this is accepted it will be rather more detailed than it is now and will cover the rather different form of abstraction which those people practise namely the taking of water out of the river and then very hurriedly putting it back again <e> <s> i believe that the amendment seeks to deal with sucking great quantities of water out of substrata or taking huge quantities out of the river and not returning them instantly <e> <s> i believe that the fish farming fraternity is a different case and i do not believe that it is adequately catered for in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> i think that it is important to keep industry competitive <e> <s> joined with that reason i think that it would be wrong if the nra funded itself in this way <e> <s> my own amendment will soon be before the committee so i shall speak no further on this one <e> <s> however for those two reasons i think that note should be taken of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment in view of the fact that my noble friend has answered the question as i wished it answered <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> so far as my amendment no <e> <s> is concerned i should like to thank my noble friend for appreciating the thought behind what apparently is bad drafting <e> <s> on the basis as she explained of taking the amendment away and bringing it back in a correct form i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly withdraw my amendment <e> <s> however i wish to go away and read <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be convenient if i spoke to my amendment no <e> <s> as it is grouped with amendment no b <e> <s> clause lays down excellent rules on how to sample water and as we discussed earlier how to pass it out between the parties concerned so that the whole matter is done properly and safely <e>", "<cs> i am not quite so happy about my amendment as the noble lord lord moran is about his <e> <s> i shall reserve my position for a later stage of the bill when i have read <e>", "<cs> if it is any help there was a debate on the channel tunnel in which i spoke <e> <s> in fact i divided the house because land was being obtained at existing use value and being passed over on a rental basis to a profit-making concern <e> <s> in reply a noble friend on the front bench said that service stations were an example <e> <s> they were compulsorily purchased and of course they did make money afterwards <e> <s> it underlines the iniquity of the whole system <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment of my noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> his solution is a perfectly reasonable one <e> <s> i am certain that it is time that these rules were changed now that privatisation is taking place in areas dealing with land <e> <s> i think that it is quite ridiculous to go on in our old ways <e> <s> his formula seems perfectly adequate <e> <s> there are others <e> <s> i hope that if his amendment is not accepted he will see fit to carry it forward to a later stage in the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> surely as my noble friend lord middleton said you cannot divide the two <e> <s> the plc is a profit making concern and that is that <e>", "<cs> that is a totally unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> that is precisely why i tabled this amendment so that there would not be particles and that kind of thing in it <e> <s> that is the whole point of the amendment <e> <s> though i shall withdraw the amendment i shall certainly bring it forward again because the whole analysis performance in this bill seems to be thoroughly unsatisfactory <e> <s> as my noble friend realises i have had a great deal of experience i am a large fish farmer of people coming and analysing water <e> <s> they live with it practically every day <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that it is very important that the matter is dealt with properly and that it is not left to the courts to guess whether or not there were particles floating about <e> <s> although i beg leave to withdraw the amendment now i shall most certainly bring it forward again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend first for saying that he would come forward with something and then for being as good as his word and secondly for filling in the gap of the flood relief committees which i had missed <e> <s> i am sure that this is an improvement to the bill <e> <s> i am very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords logistically as well as possibly a point to do with putting everything to rights straight away which is what the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh wishes to do is that people have been pleading for flexibility and a little time <e> <s> i believe it would be quite impossible logistically to get everything in order straight away <e> <s> therefore flexibility will be a necessity <e> <s> there are not sufficient mechanics management machinery or what-have-you to accomplish the job <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and i take up the words of my noble friend lord trafford <e> <s> my reason for supporting it has been repeated again and again it is to support rural communities which are distant waning and to some extent under pressure <e> <s> although an element of subsidy is creeping in it must be only small because basically we are an urban country <e> <s> our rural population has diminished and is continuing to do so <e> <s> an even rate must be charged across urban areas and rural communities <e> <s> the amendment is worthwhile and i give it all my support <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> it is a simple one which should be acceptable <e> <s> if it is not acceptable i hope that my noble friend will be able to produce something which will have the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that argentinas position would probably preclude it from making war against anyone at the present time <e> <s> does he further agree as i think he does having listened to his previous answer that senor menem first of all says one thing and then says another <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friend aware that a cathedral is in fact a church <e> <s> is he also aware that as most of the cathedrals were built at the same time they are all starting to fall down at the same time <e> <s> is it not therefore high time that both central church and state took some part in looking after such buildings properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i brought forward a similar amendment in committee and raised the point that it is rather difficult to tell exactly what is an abandoned mine and whether first the minerals had stopped being worked and then it was abandoned or whether as my noble friend lord renton just stated the mine was abandoned when it was used for storing waste of one sort or another <e> <s> there is a very good case for playing safe and taking subsection right out of the bill <e> <s> there is a danger here from abandoned mines that have no waste in them and i believe there are examples of that in the country and a great danger from a mine which is not considered abandoned because it has been filled up with rubbish or toxic waste of one sort or another <e> <s> therefore i give my support <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit to being considerably disappointed <e> <s> perhaps my own speech was a disappointment <e> <s> i had in effect to repeat what i said in committee <e> <s> and my noble friend on the front bench has repeated exactly what he said <e> <s> the circumstances have not altered at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the words of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords surely farming fish for the table has nothing to do with the duties to keep fisheries in good order has it <e>", "<cs> my lords at least i am happy that once more the feelings of fish farmers are made well known <e> <s> i cannot agree with many of the things that my noble friend said <e> <s> i admit that in my heart of hearts there is a lurking feeling that the nra should have this capability <e> <s> i hope that it will use its fish farming side however large it is with great care <e> <s> i believe it is in its own interests not to have ill feeling that can so easily brew up between fish farmers and the nra when they should be complementary to each other <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for speaking at such length on this subject <e> <s> i believe it is very important <e> <s> it certainly deserves and perhaps in the future will still deserve considerable discussion and debate <e> <s> as regards public health and emergencies and that kind of concern which has been mentioned by my noble friends lord caithness and lord renton i believe that both my noble friends are rather ignoring the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support my noble friends amendment and also to support that of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey because the two seem to go extremely well together <e> <s> perhaps the first amendment will be enough on its own although that must be in some doubt <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend comes to sum up this situation he will give us a firm assurance that we cannot accept amendment no <e> <s> because in fact rural areas will be protected from what i would term overcharging <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords from all quarters of the house who have given their support to the amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i am not convinced by my noble friends explanation about how difficult it would be as regards time and about the difficulties that the secretary of state would face <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for describing both the original amendment which your lordships accepted and also for going into some detail into the amendment which the commons have put in lieu of it <e> <s> i am happy to accept the replacement by the commons <e> <s> at the same time i should like to thank my noble friend for seeing me between the last stage of this bill in this house and now in order to discuss the sort of compromise which we have before us <e> <s> having said that indeed it is a compromise in that still in my heart of hearts i believe that the original amendment was tidy concise and covered all the matters which were worrying my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may say how much i appreciated sitting under the chairmanship of my noble friend and having him lead us through a scientific labyrinth of great interest and considerable complexity <e> <s> i agree entirely with my noble friend lord crickhowell that the report is a book which many of us will keep by us for reference for a very long time to come <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because as well as paragraph b being a little <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> if a mistake has been made and a justice of the peace acknowledges it full recompense should be paid <e> <s> i can see great difficulty in deciding what constitutes full recompense but there must be a way in which to quantify it <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to direct her mind towards that end <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to add one point which has not been mentioned <e> <s> if there is a delay in the sale interest on the money outstanding should at least be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i suppose almost inevitably i must support the amendment <e> <s> i do so in a most wholehearted way <e> <s> however i do not propose to bore members of the committee by repeating what i said a few years ago <e> <s> indeed i have purposely not reread the debate <e> <s> i agree with everything that my noble friend has said <e> <s> a great deal of trouble could be caused in this connection <e> <s> we must face the fact that such a situation could arise again <e> <s> a producer of a food source who is aggrieved should have recourse to a justice of the peace and have the chance to recoup from the government some of the losses for which he was in no way responsible <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will resist the amendment <e> <s> if i were cynical i think i would say to the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley that if he wants choice he can almost assume that everything has been sprayed in one way or another except those things he finds on the shelf which positively say that they have not been <e>", "<cs> at the end of this rather protracted debate i hope the minister will find that the amendment is not acceptable <e> <s> i endorse everything that my noble friend lord middleton has said <e> <s> i am sure that on balance it is absolutely right that there should be capability of using irradiation <e> <s> we seem to be forgetting its good points and searching for the rather more obscure dangers that lie on occasion apparently far into the future <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that although we might not wish the offspring of spongiform animals to give them a name to enter milking herds they might be almost impossible to trace <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton for presenting his report so lucidly and also to my noble friend lord middleton for producing the report of sub-committee d as regards the first report the noble and learned lord expressed a fear that some of his committee members felt that it was a little on the negative side <e> <s> having heard the speeches that followed i was very pleased that it was and that it did not go along with some of the european suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to my noble friend lord stanley for bringing this matter to the attention of your lordships <e> <s> on his suggestion i declare an interest in that i am tenant landlord manager and partner if that has any relevance in parts of wiltshire <e> <s> i also follow my noble friend in saying that the troubles of the tenant farmer are to a very large extent shared by any farmer these days <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a vigorous and extremely knowledgeable debate <e> <s> it has revealed divisions which perhaps most of us knew existed already <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> i also congratulate the noble earl lord carlisle on his very vigorous contribution <e> <s> i hope that he comes among us often as i feel that he will make a doughty debater <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that monitoring such a relatively small number of calves in relation to the totality of bse cases might lead us to very dangerous conclusions at the end of the day particularly in relation to the hereditary factor <e> <s> if the small number that has been mentioned are shown to be clear through the monitoring that will not necessarily mean that the disease is not a hereditary one <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble lord lord kimball on bringing this bill before the house <e> <s> i also congratulate this remarkable working party which got away with four meetings on what has for years and years been an extremely contentious subject <e> <s> i endorse what the noble lord lord jenkin said about rights of way <e> <s> they go right back into history and are of enormous importance <e> <s> they were of importance in the past <e> <s> they were used by people to go to church to go to work and so on <e> <s> but now with a vastly larger population which is a town population on the whole wishing to go into the country and learn something about it in a strange way this amazing network is more important than ever before <e>", "<cs> i can assure the committee that the last thing in the world i wish to do is upset the farming community or the ramblers <e> <s> i take the points that have been made <e> <s> it is obvious that the devil you know is better than the devil you do not know <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly have no intention of pressing this amendment <e> <s> i take the points that have been made <e> <s> perhaps i looked at the matter in a rather simplistic manner <e> <s> again the last thing in the world that i wish to do is to cause farmers any more trouble than they have already <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i may be able to make my point within one minute <e> <s> it has been suggested by the government and by noble lords today that the june consultative document offers an alternative to registration <e> <s> i cannot see that <e> <s> there are already plenty of laws in place to deal with dogs and dog handling <e> <s> perhaps they are not as comprehensive as they should be but we are dealing not with the laws to control dogs but with the enforcement of those laws <e> <s> before there can be enforcement i believe that there must be registration <e> <s> otherwise one can make more and more laws about rottweilers or any other breed which members of the committee might care to mention but without registration and the ability to enforce those laws the whole thing becomes a waste of time <e> <s> therefore i am in complete agreement with my noble friend and shall vote for the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on the amendment of my noble friend lord alport <e> <s> since he first brought the issue of straw burning before the chamber many noble lords <e> <s> including myself have been converted to his view previously having had views in exactly the opposite direction <e> <s> however i hope that the minister will resist any suggestion of licensing in place of regulations <e> <s> although i am against regulations generally this must be a case in which they are an absolute necessity <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord stanley and i hope that his amendment will go back to the commons once more <e> <s> i am sure that he is right about the constitutional position and right that the bill will in no way fall <e> <s> quite apart from factors such as nuisance and so on which we debated last time i strongly support the amendment because in my opinion the government perpetually miss the bus <e> <s> they go on producing more and more laws and very probably these matters should be put into a separate bill on the control of dogs while they completely fail to make the connection between the dog and the owner <e> <s> after all it is not the dogs fault if it makes a mess where it should not <e> <s> one has to be able to get to the owner in the end <e> <s> registration is probably the only way to do it <e> <s> it may not work too well to start with but its effect will be cumulative <e> <s> if it had a rocky start many noble lords would look back after a while and say that they had done right and that it was the only way to deal with an ever-growing difficulty and an ever-growing dog population <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the argentine well and believe that it would be wrong to say that it subsidises its agriculture <e> <s> the reverse situation has always been the case <e> <s> the so-called oligarchy who basically are the estancieros have been taxed up to the hilt <e>", "<cs> my lords i must put the noble baroness right since she has mentioned my name <e> <s> there is no connection whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i sat on the committee and as others did i should like to compliment my noble friend lord middleton on the careful way he steered us through an immensely complex subject <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the church on i would almost say its novel <e> <s> it is a complex subject <e> <s> that is borne out as the noble lord lord john-mackie said by the immense amount of conclusions there are when you add the two reports together although there is a tremendous cross-over <e> <s> it shows clearly that there is no straight answer to any of the problems that are upon us <e> <s> it also shows as my noble friend lord selborne said that there is no way of quantifying matters such as how much land will go out of cultivation and what effect that will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep the house long <e> <s> with any luck we shall all be able to go to the environment of the tearoom before tea stops being served <e> <s> first i wish to thank my noble friend lady blatch for the extraordinarily lucid way in which she put across what is to me a rather complicated bill <e> <s> i also wish to express the admiration which i always feel for the noble lord lord mcintosh on his considerable knowledge of the subject which i must admit i do not possess <e> <s> my only excuse for rising today is that like others i wish to put down a marker for an amendment which i hope to bring forward myself or perhaps with others <e>"]
