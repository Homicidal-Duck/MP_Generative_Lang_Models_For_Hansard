["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply may i ask him this would he agree that a result where one party with per cent <e> <s> of the votes wins per cent <e> <s> of the seats another party with per cent <e> <s> of the votes wins per cent <e> <s> of the seats and a party with per cent <e> <s> of the votes wins no seats at all cannot be considered truly democratic <e> <s> does he not think that it further denigrates to some extent our own members of the european parliament among their colleagues since they will not be considered to be truly representative <e> <s> finally will the government give an assurance that before the next elections in they will introduce a system of proportional representation for the united kingdom election on the lines that already prevail in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow what the noble lord lord monson has said by examining perhaps a little critically some of the arguments which have been put forward by noble lords opposite during the afternoon regarding the new constitution in rhodesia and what follows from that whether we should lift sanctions and recognise the rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble lord lord hatch only that he put forward certain proposals in the course of his speech regarding what he thought bishop muzorewa should do <e> <s> in my view if bishop muzorewa acceded to the suggestions of the noble lord lord hatch he would be signing his own death warrant <e> <s> it is completely unrealistic <e>", "<cs> my lords we are reaching the end of this debate and i think that i have listened to nearly all the speeches including the excellent contributions from our four maiden speakers <e> <s> the debate has certainly given a wide scope for noble lords opposite to criticise the government and indeed it is their duty to do so at least it is their duty to do so provided the criticism is constructive <e> <s> it is on that particular issue that i have been somewhat disappointed by their contributions <e> <s> they have given us rather the same recipe as before and we know that that recipe is one of failure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply may i ask whether he is aware that it was the unanimous view of parliamentarians from countries at the conference in colombo that population policies and development policies were wholly interdependent and that one was useless without the other <e> <s> will the government bear in mind the recommendations of the conference when they are deciding their allocation of overseas aid in the next financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to revert to the ministers original reply <e> <s> would the government consider increasing the ridiculously low percentage of the overseas budget spent on population policies to a more realistic figure in line with the total spent on overseas aid <e> <s> this has nothing to do with the cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords as a resident of derbyshire i should like to add a few words in support of what has been said by my two noble friends and the noble lord lord soper <e> <s> there is very little more that i can say except that derbyshire is not so rich in its buildings and particularly in its town buildings that it can afford to damage an exceptionally beautiful town centre such as buxton has <e> <s> i very much hope therefore in view of what has been said and in view of the attitude of the buxton civic association a charitable body with a very keen interest in conservation that second thoughts will be given to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that more than half of the remaining area of tropical forest in the world lies within the basins of these <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend one further question <e> <s> is this not a suitable matter for the eec to look into and is it not something which perhaps the noble lords noble friend the foreign secretary might raise at the next council of ministers because joint representations from the community would obviously be more effective <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant duty to congratulate the noble lord lord chorley on his maiden speech <e> <s> he chose a most stimulating subject and acquitted himself with distinction <e> <s> we all look forward to hearing him again <e> <s> with the exception of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble baroness and i am sure that the brandt commission have taken it also <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene briefly from these benches in support of this amendment <e> <s> i do so with great diffidence in the light of the remarks of my noble friend lord home <e> <s> had i been present in the chamber at committee stage i would have spoken in support of the amendment which was then put forward <e> <s> i did however read the debate subsequently and the reply of my noble friend lord belstead and i am bound to say that i was not persuaded by his arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that on th april in another place the minister for overseas development stated that the percentage of aid going on population activities fell from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> does he not think that the seriousness of the situation hardly justifies that reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just referred to the amount of multilateral aid that is to be given and he quoted the figure of i think million <e> <s> is it not a fact that the figure for the year previous was million <e> <s> could he not give an assurance that at least the amount of aid given to the multilateral agencies such as the united nations fund for population activities and the ippf who do such <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by welcoming this report and to congratulate the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow and his colleagues on the work that they have done <e> <s> in particular i welcome the second recommendation that as more resources become available the first priority should be to restore and increase bilateral programmes of member states and their contributions to other multinational agencies <e> <s> however as a firm supporter of the eec i think that it is highly desirable that aid should also be distributed by the eec in its own right <e> <s> it helps to build up the importance of the community in the eyes of the world and to increase its own self-confidence <e> <s> such aid also as is emphasised in paragraph tends to have fewer colonial overtones than that offered bilaterally by member states <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as i do at no <e> <s> on the list of speakers the house will not be surprised to hear that i have somewhat revised the notes for my speech <e> <s> i hope therefore not to take up too much time <e> <s> i cannot claim the expertise of the noble lord lord ohagan and other noble lords who either are or have been members of the european parliament <e> <s> my only direct experience of the workings of the community has been as a member of one of your lordships european sub-committees that on food and agriculture and that experience only confirmed me in my view about the advantages of our remaining in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always stimulating to listen to the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> i shall not follow him on the subject of political assassination but instead devote my remarks as some other noble lords have done to the north-south dialogue and to the implications of the recent mexico summit <e> <s> in view of the lateness of the hour i propose to omit what i was going to say in general terms about the summit and to concentrate on two particular aspects which the world leaders discussed and one aspect which they did not discuss but which they should have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord beaumont and before explaining my reasons for supporting the bill i wish to apologise to the noble earl lord avon if because of another engagement i cannot be present at the end of the debate <e> <s> i have read all the literature that has been sent to your lordships i have read the arguments adduced by the friends of the earth and i have read the arguments of the glass manufacturers <e> <s> having done all that and having listened to the speeches made in this debate including the impassioned plea of the noble lord lord jacques my mind has in no way been altered and i remain strongly of the view that the bill should receive a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i am qualified to answer that question <e> <s> i cannot say whether the cost would be greater than that for the distribution trades <e> <s> i accept that there would be a certain additional cost but as the noble baroness lady birk said we must regard that as a small tax which the community has to pay to make the country a more worthwhile place in which to live <e> <s> if therefore the noble lord lord beaumont forces a division i shall support him in the lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i put this point to him <e> <s> he said that there is a surplus which is true of milk products in the community as a whole <e> <s> it is also true that there is not a surplus within the united kingdom and that we have to import quite a large proportion of our dairy products <e> <s> so this particular order will discriminate against the united kingdom dairy industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble and learned lord for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that very many people throughout the country deplore the fact that this prosecution for murder of a downs syndrome baby later the charge was changed to attempted murder was ever brought in the first place <e> <s> does he not think that in these admittedly very delicate and difficult cases it is better to leave the decision to the discretion of the medical profession who have over the years exercised that discretion with both humanity and good sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could put a final supplementary to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> dr arthur was sent for trial on th april this year and the case did not come up until the middle of october <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord not think that this puts a quite intolerable strain not only on innocent defendants but on their families and could not something be done to speed up the administration of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to discuss the question of fish farming without first referring to the late lady emmet of amberley who did so much to bring the subject of fish farming to the notice of your lordships and indeed to the notice of successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that this country holds a completely disproportionate share of artistic treasures compared with other countries <e> <s> is there not a case for the government having second thoughts on this in the interests of good international relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join previous speakers in expressing my appreciation from this bench at the motion which has been put before the house by the noble lord lord oram <e> <s> i should like to begin my speech by welcoming the new lease of life i think it was mentioned by the noble lord lord banks which has been given to the brandt commission at their meeting held recently in kuwait <e> <s> it seems to me desirable in helping to solve the problems outlined in their report that this distinguished body of international statesmen should remain in being to keep a watching brief and to impress on sometimes sluggish governments both in the west and in the third world a sense of urgency which is sorely needed in present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord hatch resumes his seat he took me up on the question of infant mortality <e> <s> if he cares to examine statistics in countries such as kenya and nigeria he will find that infant mortality in these countries is on western levels and that is the whole cause of the trouble today there is death control but there is insufficient birth control <e>", "<cs> my lords there is probably no one in this house who is not concerned about this subject which has been raised with such deep feeling by the noble lord lord molloy this afternoon <e> <s> we on this bench believe that a high priority should be given to reducing the present level of unemployment and especially unemployment among the young <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been making speeches in your lordships house on the subject of population <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i put five suggestions to him <e> <s> i did not give him notice of them so i do not expect an answer today <e> <s> but i wondered whether he would be willing to write to me about them <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the dust of the falklands war has begun to settle is it not time that her majestys government took a rather more positive view towards the long term future of gibraltar in conjunction with the spanish government than they have hitherto done <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an emotive subject <e> <s> it always has been and i suppose it always will be <e> <s> we were subjected particularly to some cases quoted by <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has quoted one individual doctor <e> <s> i was not quoting one individual doctor i was quoting the different bodies responsible for medical opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene as the noble earl suggested i might i never said that medical opinion should not be challenged all i said was that very great weight should be given to it when they were unanimous on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to my noble friend lord walston for introducing this debate <e> <s> the working party report tells us a lot about how british aid to africa is dispensed <e> <s> it tells us that the quality of that aid is of a very high order that it is satisfactory <e> <s> its principal conclusion which i think is supported by what your lordships have said this afternoon is that we should step up the amount of aid which we are providing both in agricultural terms and overall <e> <s> what surprisingly the report does not say and what surely is of special interest to donor countries such as ours is whether the aid is being really effective <e> <s> are the african recipients of aid becoming more efficient in agricultural terms and are they producing more food for their people to eat <e> <s> that after all must be the object of the exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i was targeting that as the sole cause but as one of the causes <e> <s> in a sense it is a chicken-and-egg situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord bethell for raising this important topic this afternoon <e> <s> i myself believe that it is difficult to look at the helsinki agreement in isolation <e> <s> it must be considered in the whole context of soviet relations with the west and it may sometimes be necessary to look through russian eyes however difficult that may be <e> <s> so my speech will range a little wider than that of the noble lord who described so eloquently and so movingly how the russians have not implemented the final act of the agreement in the spirit that we had the right to expect <e> <s> coupled with the continued presence of soviet troops in afghanistan this has led to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is she aware however that circumstances have changed very dramatically over the past few years that spain is now a democracy and a member of the european community <e> <s> would it not be in the interests not only of great britain and spain but also of the people of gibraltar in the longer term that sovereignty over gibraltar should be transferred to spain subject to the necessary safeguards such as a lease-back or any other arrangement that may be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns aid programmes is the noble lord aware that the population of africa is on average doubling every years <e> <s> is he further aware that only per cent <e> <s> of the aid given by her majestys government goes to family planning and per cent <e> <s> to other purposes <e> <s> does not the noble lord agree that these proportions are inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be relieved to hear that i have torn up the majority of my speech because most of the points have already been covered by previous speakers <e> <s> i was going to make three main points <e> <s> the first is that when we talk of sanctions there is insufficient appreciation in this country of the nature of the afrikaner and of his mentality <e> <s> their love of country is based upon an almost religious fervour and <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords in this debate i believe that the noble baroness lady lockwood has raised some very important issues in the question that she has asked <e> <s> these are issues which are all too often swept under the carpet because on the whole politicians are unwilling to face up to the implications of unrestricted population growth in the third world <e> <s> this is largely because the effect of such growth will not be felt for several years and several years is a long time in politics <e> <s> also there is a body of opinion in this country perhaps represented by the noble lord lord bauer who believe that in any case the third world should be left to their own devices and we should not interfere <e> <s> on the other hand i believe that we are a single world now <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord want to interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are a single world now and we cannot escape our responsibility to help others less fortunate than ourselves particularly as the noble lord lord henderson has said when they ask for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that point perfectly when the noble lord made it <e> <s> however i was talking about bangladesh <e> <s> if one allows every woman in bangladesh to have as many children as she wants the result is going to be absolute disaster <e> <s> i quote bangladesh as one of many similar examples because it is a country where population concern has helped to bring health and family planning services to couples in the slum areas of chittagong <e> <s> we have done so partly as a result of the tireless efforts of the well known actress susan hampshire who has personally raised more than for the project but also because of the substantial grants which we have received from oda <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for this very welcome government assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not quite catch the beginning of the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they may do so to some extent but evidently the chinese who have great experience in this matter did not think that it would be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to concentrate on an aspect of the problem to which the noble baroness has drawn attention but which is frequently overlooked <e> <s> it has very largely been overlooked so far <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the minister said is he aware that millions of acres of tropical forest are being destroyed annually <e> <s> the size is estimated to be the area of england wales and scotland <e> <s> that is having disastrous ecological and environmental consequences <e> <s> does he appreciate that western europe is one of the main importers of some of those tropical hardwoods <e> <s> should this country not give some lead to the ec by reducing or preferably halting altogether those imports <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the whole house should be indebted to the noble lord lord dormand for asking this question on a vital topic which is so often ignored <e> <s> on a practical level is the minister aware that the reagan administration cancelled all united states government funding to the international planned parenthood federation as a result of pressure from the so-called life lobby and that the united states funding was at that time the main source of the ippfs income <e> <s> will the government use their influence with the bush administration to have that decision reversed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord houghton who was in his usual vigorous form <e> <s> i agree with every word that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pretend to be an expert on tropical forests in the sense of the noble earl who opened this debate or the noble lord lord shackleton who followed him <e> <s> i am purely an amateur with a very keen interest in the preservation of the environment and the forest in particular <e> <s> i hope that the remarks which follow will be taken in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will be clarify a statistic that he has given <e> <s> he said that only per cent <e> <s> of the tropical forest wood was sold as timber overseas and that the rest was <e>"]
