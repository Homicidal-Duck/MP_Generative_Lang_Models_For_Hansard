["<cs> my lords i put my name down on the list of speakers today because i happen to have served for a long time on one of cosiras small industries committees namely the one in sussex <e> <s> in speaking today i am expressing my own views and not necessarily those of that committee <e> <s> i also have a strong desire to encourage the government as regards small business <e> <s> so far they have made a good attempt to improve the general climate for business which includes small business <e> <s> all that i can say further and i want to be encouraging is that i trust that if they go ahead as regards small business in the way that they have said that they would in their original election manifesto then so much the better <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have certain reservations they are much on the same lines as those of my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> i wish tonight to congratulate the government on much that is contained in the bill or the greater proportion of it <e> <s> much of what i wished to say has already been said by my noble friends lord ridley and lord middleton and how well i thought it was said <e> <s> while referring to other speeches i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord grimston of westbury on his maiden speech and say how quite sure i am that the whole house was pleased to be reminded of the problem of litter which he so rightly raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like quickly to support the plea made by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley and the noble earl lord caithness that if possible in sensitive areas the applications should go to the adas officer first <e> <s> i believe that would be vital and valuable if it could be achieved and if so it is quite likely that the farming community would be very much happier about this matter <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a word in support of my noble friend lord stanley of alderley because i believe his amendment to be most important <e> <s> i think that the further planning gets into the hands of smaller and more numerous authorities the less easy it appears likely that the government will find it to be to control land take <e> <s> land take is a national matter and i think the amendment has a bearing on that aspect of it <e> <s> while the amendment will not altogether satisfy what was recommended in the strutt report at least it goes a considerable way towards doing <e>", "<cs> i am rather worried and i should like to mention to my noble friend lord bellwin that once land has gone for development it has gone for good <e> <s> i should like to ask him one question <e> <s> do we have enough flexibility in this matter <e> <s> for instance should the grade of the land and simply the grade of the land be the only criterion to which we should work here <e> <s> what about the aspects of a mixture of land and the effects on units concerned and so forth <e> <s> i remain very concerned about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend keep a very close eye upon costs and uncertainty caused to farmers by blanket sssis such as that at pevensey level in sussex <e> <s> further will he consider in particular that if compensation is inadequate or delayed the system will earn the hostility of farmers whose co-operation in practice is extremely badly needed in order to secure good conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming these proposals to allow british rail to raise cash by the sale of some of its non-rail subsidiaries may i ask my noble friend what assurances he has that every effort will be made to ensure that the sum so raised will not be wasted upon such things as over-manning or excessive wage settlements but that these sums so raised will be spent upon maintaining the maximum railway network efficiency possible and also incidentally maintaining the jobs that will go with that <e>", "<cs> before too many noble lords condemn this clause altogether i think there is something to be said for it <e> <s> so far as the ordinary sssis are concerned that is those that are not subject to clause we now have the position that the owner is going to know what the ncc wishes should be preserved and what the ncc think will damage the site <e> <s> that is a great improvement <e> <s> if the owner of such a site proposes to do anything that would damage it he really has two alternatives as i see it <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must realise that the owner and the occupier would perhaps forfeit a drainage grant <e> <s> there must be advantages in seeking a management agreement provided reasonable terms are offered and provided the ncc which one hopes does have a little money would come forward with it <e>", "<cs> i feel that what the noble viscount lord hanworth said a moment ago over the last amendment is fairly apposite in that this is a complicated matter <e> <s> at this stage it would probably be best to take this matter away and look at it <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend lord bellwin will do the same <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that they will inevitably be consulted in the course of the proceedings <e> <s> i am asking for earlier consultation for owners and i added the particular rider that of course the users might ask to be included at that stage too <e> <s> i added the plea that i hoped that the users would see that where they had initiated the proceedings they had in fact already had the chance to submit their views in that way <e>", "<cs> i should like to stress that it seems necessary to ensure that local authorities make a thorough job of this consultation because if they do not they will not make a good job of the map <e> <s> therefore it seems to me important that the degree of consultation that the government have in mind should be very clear to all and i hope that my noble friend may be able to enlarge a little further on this matter because it might be helpful <e> <s> i also wonder whether the government would be able to take this matter away with a view to coming forward with a more general statement regarding in particular reconsultation <e> <s> could it perhaps be with all those who would be affected and with all who had made objections and all who had appeared at the inquiry <e>", "<cs> possibly we might wish to return to this at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> indeed i should like to thank my noble friend for that sympathetic reply <e> <s> i am sure we shall have time to study this matter a little further and some of the narrower points <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment relates to horses <e> <s> it refers to highways which will include footpaths <e> <s> i think therefore he has gone a little further than one might realise from first appearances <e> <s> it is fair enough in my view about horses <e> <s> it is reasonable to say so far as pedestrians are concerned that it is unreasonable to put them on a very narrow piece of land with an electric fence beside them but sometimes it is justified particularly if the distance left before the electric fence is wide enough to be reasonable <e> <s> a good deal more thought needs to be given to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he can enlarge on it a little by simply saying whether he considers the position to be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend still see room for economies if private enterprise is permitted to carry out more local authority services which in america has been done both more economically and more efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords i must emphasise the difficulties about compulsion however much they are last resort back-up powers because they will be used as a handle <e> <s> this is the great fear of the agriculturists that it will lead to inadequate offers under management agreements and then to hostility from there on <e> <s> that is the great fear <e> <s> that is why i believe it would be very much better that we stick to the governments amendment as it is and the voluntary principle <e> <s> it will give us at once in any case an ally on the spot as nothing else will <e> <s> so far i do not think we have achieved this because so far with all the difficulties we have had about lack of information from one side to the other we have not really been approaching a voluntary system sensibly <e> <s> now i believe we are going to do just that and the great thing to do is to try to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply to amendment no <e> <s> sca <e> <s> i am not very clear as to why the noble lord lord melchett is concerned about years of continuous use being ignored <e> <s> this rupp which has been reclassified has probably been reclassified as a bridleway over the last few years <e> <s> the point i want to put to my noble friend on the front bench about it is this if the highway authority have a very good reason for not wanting to have to reclassify an rupp and to classify <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to this amendment with the other two amendments <e> <s> just to remind your lordships it concerns the extinguishment of vehicular rights on roads used as public paths reclassiffied under the act <e> <s> i am most grateful for the support that i received from noble lords <e> <s> i think in view of this that i should prefer to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be best if i intervene also at this particular moment <e> <s> while i support waymarking and signposting in general and very much so i remain opposed to amendment no <e> <s> za itself <e> <s> it will i think encourage motorcyclists who otherwise would not do so to come off a road <e> <s> the clause would lay a duty on authorities to signpost byways where they leave metalled roads <e> <s> it is very important that there should be a discretion left to authorities as to whether they do this or whether they do not because of the risk i have just explained <e> <s> i do not want to ruin the fun for motor-cyclists and i have had a go at it already today but it does not seem necessary to give them quite so many privileges under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak very briefly to amendment no <e> <s> c if i may <e> <s> first i wish to welcome most sincerely the abandonment of the need to give notice of intention to plough a path <e> <s> i am sure that we gave the spicer committee no end of an agenda after our committee stage and we should congratulate it on the enormous amount of work which it must have been doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him further about the numbers of investigations made <e> <s> are they not substantially fewer than were initially expected when the bill was passed <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend might enlarge upon the reasons for that <e> <s> would it appear that the present facilities will prove adequate <e> <s> will there be an improvement in the price commissions ability to monitor prices when they are coupled as they should be and as they are now with the same monetary policy in order to reduce inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend quickly whether he knows what the ncc considers to be the minimum number of merlins and hen harriers required to maintain a viable population for wales <e> <s> how many acres would be required per pair for feeding <e> <s> if there are pairs of merlins in the berwyn hills would they require acres <e> <s> is all this the reason why yet another five sites are under consideration in wales near the berwyns for ornithology preservation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is as disturbed as i am to hear that an authority was automatically turning down planning applications for rural workshops in an area of outstanding natural beauty <e> <s> would my noble friend not agree that if such a policy is to be followed it will fossilize and eventually destroy village communities whether they are in a green belt or not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend and the government for those two clarifying amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> at the same time may i ask him a question <e> <s> before doing so may i assure my noble friend that i am extremely anxious to accept the new proposals contained in amendments nos <e> <s> to because of an overriding desire on the part of the agricultural interest to show <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak in opposition to the amendment and briefly to show the other side of the picture <e> <s> if we pass the amendment we shall disturb the balance achieved so far which i believe to be a valuable degree of consensus which <e>", "<cs> for example my lords i have heard no objection from the nature conservancy council among others and i should have thought there was at least some degree of consensus and i trust the noble baroness will grant me that <e> <s> the amendment endangers the principle of paying compensation in return for conservation measures undertaken by owners and occupiers of agricultural land and briefly i would mention the case of the pevensey levels in sussex because i was present at a number of the meetings which took place after the designation of that particular sssi so i heard a good many of the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord studies this carefully i think he will see that it reduces the amount of compensation that is available <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel driven to say a few words in opposition to this amendment by the noble lord lord melchett on the view that one week appears to be an unreasonably short time <e> <s> when the bill left here to go to another place the time allowed for reinstatement of paths had been three weeks <e> <s> the time for restoring paths at the moment is three weeks normally unless notification to the highway authority has been made <e> <s> the spicer committee had also recommended three weeks as being a suitable period <e> <s> that committee was set up to get agreement between interested organisations about these things <e> <s> then a political deal was made and there was a reduction to two weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure but i think that all this was dealt with on a previous occasion <e> <s> i wanted to say that the reduction from three weeks to two weeks is considered by farmers to be likely to increase the demand for them to do things which are likely to be difficult and which will add to the arable farmers life a degree of inconvenience wasted effort and cost <e> <s> but farmers organisations have accepted this particular part of the package in any case and therefore i am sure they would not want to disturb the balance achieved now <e> <s> i should not like to see the truce broken <e> <s> i think it is most important that this house should approve the commons amendment without further alteration <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to speak against the amendment my lords <e> <s> the issue is narrow as my noble friend lord avon endeavoured to point out and because of its narrowness it is inevitable and perhaps not unreasonable that there should not have been a great degree of discussion and perhaps one need not complain too much about that <e> <s> my understanding of the position is that this affects only the tenant farmer who is also tenant of the sporting rights <e> <s> in most cases after all a tenant farmer is not also tenant of the sporting rights or alternatively there is an owner occupier who probably himself has the sporting rights so only a small category of people are concerned i doubt whether their numbers are at all large <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that reply upon this important government initiative concerning adult training <e> <s> can my noble friend comment upon the mention in the consultative document of an intention to establish some major open learning schemes over an initial period of three to five years <e> <s> does he think that parts of this at least could become operational more quickly than this particularly bearing in mind the need to try to equip ourselves more quickly for the next trade upturn <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it is true that we are well behind our industrial competitors in this field and therefore that there is a considerable need to redeploy the resources we are using as well as to increase them <e> <s> noting the statement in the consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> as i gather that this perquisite may have cost nearly million may i ask my noble friend whether he would not view it as a serious matter if this particular habit of paying out compensation for what might best be described as assumed loss of value in travel concessions spread to other areas such as to british airways because of lower fares brought about by competition from sir freddie laker or to british rail because of cheaper away-day facilities offered to the public <e> <s> does my noble friend not think that perhaps this practice has gone far enough <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the most significant aspect of this matter is the need to bear in mind that waste of public money must inevitably contribute to increased unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether first that confirms the importance of maintained and increased agricultural output to our balance of payments <e> <s> but are there not grave doubts in the industry whether the eec commission price proposals which represent an increase of something under per cent <e> <s> will be sufficient to maintain the productive base of our industry in the united kingdom or to increase the very low current level of profitability <e> <s> will the minister therefore endeavour if possible to obtain something rather better than the proposals and something certainly no worse <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he can comment upon the recent growth of national aids within the common agricultural policy membership and say whether these will not provide our own agriculture with unfair competition if they go unchecked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him for a few figures <e> <s> first what is the present size of the establishment of the service <e> <s> what is its current annual gross cost and its net cost after recovery of consultancy fees <e> <s> i should also like to ask what attempts have been made to estimate the benefit of the service and by whom <e>", "<cs> in putting my name to this amendment i should like to say that the amendment does not seek to return to the <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment because i believe that this matter needs the most careful consideration of the committee <e> <s> i think that the smaller firms will always remain afraid to sue in any case and therefore they will be afraid again to sue for interest under the clause that is in the bill as my noble friend lord stanley pointed out because they fear for their loss of goodwill and loss of customers <e> <s> i also believe that this is a bad thing for the public because faced with those who do and do not pay what does the trader do <e> <s> he covers himself <e> <s> the good payer in the end has to pay for the bad payer <e> <s> for that reason i believe that it would be very much better for there to be statutory interest on debts <e> <s> i know that there is of course a vested interest the vested interest of those who do not pay <e> <s> but it cannot be said that this is good for efficient trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is reasonably satisfied with the degree of increase in profit sharing that we have seen bearing in mind the difficult time it has been for profits worldwide <e> <s> does he agree now that we have better fiscal incentives that care and thought are still necessary before the introduction of schemes which are tailored properly to the interests of the individual businesses concerned <e> <s> may i also ask whether he can tell us how many profit sharing schemes were approved in and how many there are now in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether or not it is vital to achieve a proper balance in these matters to preserve employees security which is the first thing they need then to improve employee involvement and then to be careful to avoid discouraging the risk taker <e> <s> without the risk taker we are nowhere <e> <s> does not this necessitate the continuation of voluntary schemes with fiscal aid upon which the government have embarked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that concise outline <e> <s> how do the government feel that their policies compare with those of our major trade competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend about the proposed review of industrial standards policies and in particular when a report on this is expected <e> <s> again how do we now compare with our foreign competitors in these matters <e> <s> will we shortly be in the lead in this field <e> <s> i very much hope we will be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he has some detail as to which areas of the country primarily have the empty houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i do think we must get this matter right for harvest <e> <s> the bill will be too late for harvest <e> <s> it is really a question of whether the by-law fines will be in time or not for the harvest of <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the report <e> <s> much of it i am sure is good <e> <s> when it refers to marketing and in particular to the uplands i very much agree with it <e> <s> i also agree about the slowness of revision of certain areas of the common agricultural policy though possibly i might want some of those areas revised more quickly and others might want them revised more slowly <e> <s> nevertheless overall i believe the comment is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply and following from it may i ask him how well we compare in vocational training with other member countries of the eec and how well he expects the youth training scheme will improve our position <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the standards to which uht milk is subjected in france are the same as they are in england and whether he has comparable figures for other eec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am glad that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has prayed against these orders <e> <s> i am anxious i must at once say to stick to the conventions of this house about voting against orders <e> <s> however i am glad that this debate enables me to express my serious concern about the orders <e>", "<cs> i think that at this hour we have had a good discussion <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i am glad that he is looking at retirement in general though i am a little disappointed that he was not more amenable to our problem <e> <s> i should like to return to the matter at report stage but in the meantime i am sure that my best course is to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i before the noble lord lord john-mackie speaks again say that of course i should be willing to talk about it <e> <s> i hope indeed that we might be able to come to some better conclusions <e> <s> i know the tenant farmers association do not think it is necessary that all tenants should be provided with pensions by the landlord <e> <s> however i am not ruling out discussion in any way at all <e> <s> i believe it would be much better to find a solution over pensions if that would produce the result that i wanted <e> <s> i also wanted to say that i wish to be cautious and not rush into this in order that we should get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a valuable discussion <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also feel considerable concern about the rural situation <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree with the noble lord lord northfield that a policy for the aged will necessarily solve the problem in villages <e> <s> what i think is wrong with where the bills gets us now is that it leaves rural areas with warden accommodation which is more centralised and by my analysis i think the pressure of demand is not so much upon that as upon local unwardened accommodation in smaller groups in villages near the rest of the elderly persons family <e> <s> this consists of the odd bungalows and ground floor flats that exist in villages <e> <s> there are not many of them so there is little choice <e> <s> they are scarce and are difficult for local government or anybody else to replace in rural areas <e> <s> that is where the difficulty lies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend the minister on his comprehensive introduction to the regulations it helped to clarify matters <e> <s> from the briefs i have seen i gather that most of the questions that remain unanswered are not those that are dealt with by the regulations but those yet to be dealt with <e> <s> i regard this as a good sign a sign that what the government have done is to make a slow and perhaps somewhat piecemeal approach rather than a hasty effort to be comprehensive which might have got things wrong <e> <s> i believe it is absolutely right to have proceeded in this way given all the time that we had to acquiesce in accepting the quota system <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is aware that there is information coming from brussels that the french intend further national aids for beef producers to the tune of million <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend to keep a very close eye on this and to consider whether the french really ought to withdraw it or else whether more ought to be done universally within the eec bearing in mind the pressure upon meat markets of the milk quotas <e> <s> will he do this in order to ensure fair competitive conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak on part iii of the bill and also from an interest in farming <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support my noble friend the mover of the amendment <e> <s> i should not wish again to see licensing cause a barrier under which united kingdom agro-chemicals start to cost more than they do in the eec <e> <s> the price discrepancy arose under the present scheme <e> <s> i think that if it had not arisen a potent cause for this legislation would not have arisen <e> <s> it certainly helped to precipitate this bill <e>", "<cs> both amendments nos <e> <s> and deal with a very difficult subject <e> <s> i support in principle my noble friend lord stanleys amendment amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord northbourne <e> <s> my noble friend the minister has also expressed an excellent earnest of good intention about the whole matter <e> <s> there is anxiety among many people that possibly something more might be included in the bill to try to define matters a little further which is a difficult thing to do <e> <s> the fear is that the users will be too rigidly tied to equally rigid instructions on the can and the wish is that instructions should be more in the nature of statements setting out limits within which pesticides may be used in order to keep flexibility <e> <s> again that is easier said than done <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not ask for that <e> <s> i merely wanted some clarification because i know that the industry in this country would be grateful for it <e> <s> this is very much a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend on the front bench for that most informative reply <e> <s> i think that in view of what he has said it is pretty unlikely that one would wish to proceed further at a later stage <e> <s> i will await what he may write nevertheless <e> <s> may i thank him for offering to write <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of press reports that the commission is now offering concessions to member states to get levy paid <e> <s> i gather that one of these concessions may well amount to absolving france from levy altogether in the first year <e> <s> i wonder whether these concessions will overall be fair to united kingdom producers who have met their target under the quota system at great cost to themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word in support of the amendment of my noble friend lord stanley <e> <s> my noble friend the minister expressed very satisfactory intentions about imports of chemicals <e> <s> that is not in doubt at all <e> <s> i know that he does not wish to restrict imports unreasonably <e> <s> however the industry still remains anxious about similar products hence the amendment which is largely to ascertain the governments intention regarding rapidity of clearance for other imported safe pesticides <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend lord stanley on this amendment <e> <s> i strongly believe that it is most important that someone is there to carry the flag for innovation in this organisation once it becomes statutory <e> <s> when i say carry the flag i am referring to paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords these cases are likely to be rare i am sure but they could be serious for an individual farmer or grower <e> <s> i remain concerned about the position of farmers whose crops are affected by emergency orders and where we find that the remedies which they would normally have do not function properly as in this case <e> <s> i should like to say just those few words in support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i set great store by this matter <e> <s> it is most important that the advisory committee has an innovative role <e> <s> we have already heard from the committee sufficient about the rigidities that inevitably come with a statutory scheme that we have to accept and about the importance of the techniques that might be stifled <e> <s> i will not say any more about those aspects because i am sure the house is aware of them my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about reaction so far <e>

seems that indeed we are faced with a hard and difficult issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say to my noble friend lord alport that i think that this bill is more reasonable than the previous one <e> <s> i congratulate him on the way that he has gone into this and on his better appreciation now of the difficulty that the industry is in <e> <s> if licensing were to be brought in i think that it would certainly be much better done by the ministry of agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we do not find ourselves going simply from the isle of wight to east sussex <e> <s> i should like to say first to my noble friend the minister that i support the main thrust of the bill <e> <s> i have a few matters to deal with which i hope may improve the bill and a few reservations <e> <s> i am by no means as gloomy about the situation as was the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> i feel that we must build on the hereford experiment and others keep the best deal with the bad and that that is what the bill in the main is doing <e> <s> i must confess to a hankering for what is known as on-the-road competition where possible as being the best way to test the market properly and to improve the quality of service offered <e> <s> i believe that it does that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful that my noble friend the minister has recognised the very real dangers of the suspension of bus services as a result of lack of time and the trouble that that could cause <e> <s> i certainly welcome his assurances that at least this may be tried out for a trial period <e> <s> i think we must all consider that and the results thereof <e> <s> i should also like very much to thank the members of the committee who have supported me over this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we in east sussex are not quite as senior as the noble lord who has just spoken but our average age is frighteningly high <e> <s> the number of people over is i believe the highest percentage of any county <e> <s> it is because of this that we have specialist vehicles dual purpose vehicles which can take the infirm <e> <s> they have a lift at the back especially to do that <e>

vehicles and they are not actually in the hands of the operators <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just a word to the effect that i sympathise with the principles which brought my noble friend lady vickers to put down and move this amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will keep a very close eye on what i call the problems of the interface namely the interface between two systems the competitive sector <e>", "<cs> i think that county councils could better anticipate their problems if the registration details are sufficiently close to the ground <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend can do a bit more to indicate how detailed the registrations will be on stops timings and so forth <e> <s> that is what will determine the ease with which highway authorities can deal with the matter <e> <s> before we get on too far with the bill more may be known about that <e> <s> if so so much the better <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i thank my noble friend very much <e> <s> that gives us all considerable food for thought meanwhile <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on monday evening i was a little heartened by what my noble friend the minister said in reply to my noble friend lady vickers on her amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he said that <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i think that he has reason for it <e> <s> i can understand the problems in connection with the isle of wight <e> <s> the amendment would also be of considerable benefit to other county councils dealing with ordinary commercial bus services running across a land boundary <e> <s> i mention that point in passing <e>", "<cs> i also have some sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether it is the right approach and i do not know what my noble friend the minister will say about it in reply but i do not think that it will be too favourable <e> <s> however it is further evidence that the bill creates a problem for rural areas and particularly for semi-rural areas those rural areas that are near pretty large conurbations <e> <s> because there has been a higher degree of cross-subsidy there are doubts whether economies in operation can fill the gap partly because in some of those areas very substantial economies have already been made <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that my noble friend the minister makes difficulties with my schemes <e> <s> i have already proposed a good many schemes to solve the problems of rural areas and so have other noble lords on both sides of the committee <e> <s> of course my concept is that the grant really should be used to help with problems that arise over local authority grants in those areas where as a result of the bill the subsidy will rise and where there is no other way of meeting the extra cost which that subsidy provides <e> <s> the intention of my noble friend is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to my noble friend the minister for the manner in which he introduced the regulations and the scheme <e> <s> i should also like to say how very much i have appreciated his helpfulness and his skill in connection with a great deal of other parliamentary business this session <e> <s> while there are some good innovations in this scheme i must confess to being unhappy about the continued grant reductions <e> <s> i am aware that some members of the public welcome them <e> <s> it is therefore important to stress as my noble friend lord middleton did the view that i very much share that the guarantee fund of the ec has had too much and the guidance fund too little <e> <s> i hope that our ministers and the government will continue to take that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment because quite apart from its virtues or possibly its vices i feel that it is useful to discuss this matter before we reach schedule and certainly at this stage of the bill <e> <s> it is important in this sphere to get matters as right as possible <e> <s> it will not encourage on-the-road competition so well if there is too little time left for it to appear at the outset <e> <s> at the same time i am well aware that there are those who believe that we should get on with the bill and the whole process as fast as we can if we have to do it <e> <s> i tend to agree but i am also aware of the difficulties <e> <s> there are problems particularly in the urban areas and in counties like lancashire and cheshire which have bigger urban conurbations and there are problems interconnected with local government reorganisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not here i am afraid when this began and i must apologise to my noble friend lord teviot i may have missed some of it <e> <s> before we go any further i should like to say that i am most concerned about the subject of community buses <e> <s> the record of community buses is i understand a good one <e> <s> i can understand the feeling of people who operate and drive them that they should at least be allowed to do what everybody else among the general public is allowed to do with a minibus <e> <s> i suspect that the record of community buses by way of driving safety on the roads is far better than that of the general public in minibuses <e> <s> these services are the last ditch for the village when there is great difficulty over transport and it is also a very difficult job to get such services started <e> <s> they are voluntary organisations <e> <s> the organiser is the most important person in the whole set-up and so are the drivers important <e> <s> usually the vehicle is under the <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he say whether or not he is prepared to do something towards this end perhaps over the rural services alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i must try and say a few more things about this matter <e> <s> a principal difficulty with the bill is of course that in a perfect world it would be satisfactory without an amendment of this kind at all <e> <s> what makes the world imperfect and produces the need for an amendment such as this is the constraints of local government finance <e> <s> it is for that reason that one needs to be pragmatic in certain cases right on the fringes <e> <s> it is a difficulty that is inevitably with us <e>", "<cs> i do not want to spoil the rural issue <e> <s> i would like to preserve that <e> <s> it may be that there is a better case for it and it is easier to do <e> <s> however i think that perhaps we should show an opinion on the amendment <e> <s> i think that perhaps i should test the mood of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word or two in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i think it is worth supporting if such provisions are not already in the bill <e> <s> i am advised that it could also be useful for the institution from time to time in circumstances which might arise fairly suddenly of a trial service which could be done simply on a use it or lose it basis so that one knew whether or not it was worth proceeding with thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with a most important industry for the country <e> <s> its welfare is of great importance to us all <e> <s> for that reason i should like to make it clear that i welcome the bill and the effort to privatise <e>", "<cs> i feel that this is not really a party political matter and i should like to say a few words in support of amendments nos <e> <s> and to which i put my name <e>", "<cs> i must confess to being somewhat ambivalent about this particular amendment <e> <s> however i felt that i must say a few words because i am well aware of the interest generated around heathrow and gatwick <e> <s> evidently the government now intend to regulate traffic by means of traffic distribution rules and there is a school of thought perhaps it is an outmoded school of thought but i think we ought to hear about it while this matter is being debated that traffic distribution rules are not as precise a method of control as atms <e>", "<cs> i am rather concerned about this matter because clause catalogues matters to be taken into account by the caa with reference to its actions under clauses and <e> <s> it goes into some detail but leaves out environmental matters <e> <s> i am not sure what the noble lord lord underhill will do with the amendment which is of course in his name <e> <s> he may wish to revise it and bring it back <e> <s> i attach more importance to those environmental matters and i am sure the committee understands what i mean evidently than does my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> clauses and are important from an environmental point of view and hence my support for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is worth mentioning one point since i have had to study this in the light of other amendments <e> <s> i do not think that section of the civil aviation act is being repealed <e> <s> its effect is to be modified when matters to do with clauses and of this bill will be considered but i think that otherwise it stands <e> <s> it does say most of the things that we want one of them being <e>", "<cs> this is a matter that concerns me <e> <s> i was unhappy to discover that the local authorities were not consulted about the air traffic distribution rules in the london area recently <e> <s> that surprised me <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill said that he believed these things to be planning relevant <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that i also believe that to be the case <e> <s> there is no doubt that when gatwick was starting traffic had to be steered in its direction and that it did not particularly want to go there at first <e> <s> this will happen again in the case of stansted <e> <s> surely there must be implications for planning connected with the speed at which traffic increases at stansted the types of aircraft landing there the question of night flying the amount of road traffic generated and so forth <e> <s> there is a good deal in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word or two in support of this amendment <e> <s> the justification for it has already been pretty well urged i think the house will agree <e> <s> i shall not elaborate too much <e> <s> i was grateful at committee stage when my noble friend said that he hoped he had made it crystal clear that government policy was to continue to take environmental factors into account <e> <s> by way of environmental factors what i am thinking about particularly is what in terms of compensation is generally known as injurious affection <e> <s> injurious affection is a species of damage that has to be paid for <e> <s> it is injurious affection that airports create <e> <s> it is a cost to the community <e> <s> i made that point in view of what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said earlier about the dangers of getting too much involved in worrying about the environment when you have to make money out of air traffic <e> <s> you still have to pay for injurious affection <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend is entirely aware of some of the bitter things that happened around gatwick in the early days when people were not adequately compensated and suffered very badly <e> <s> i do not think he should take that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend the minister very much indeed for this thorough reply <e> <s> this is obviously a fairly complicated issue and i should like to reserve my position to the extent that if there were reason for it i might like to return to it on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something in support of the amendment put forward by my noble friend <e> <s> i am very glad that he has tabled it and that the noble lord lord walston has supported it <e> <s> it will not suit everyone but the tragedy of this business is that in fact it can suit nobody because what we are really talking about is the division of a loss and nothing else <e> <s> there is a great deal of talk about windfall profits here <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not like the amendment very much <e> <s> i do not see why we should opt out of all international trade in agricultural products in favour of other nations which go on overproducing i might say other developed nations which go on overproducing <e> <s> this smacks to me frankly as the same kind of thinking as unilateral disarmament <e> <s> i suggest that we should not put anything like this into our own legislation but that we should leave our governments hands free to see that if we do anything about these surpluses other people do so too <e> <s> it is i believe a matter essentially for international agreement <e> <s> if no adequate agreement can be obtained we should leave ourselves free to remain in the rat race <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about this matter <e> <s> i hasten to explain to backtrack for a moment that in fact i preferred schedule to the bill to amendment no <e> <s> but i also have the strongest sympathy for the amendment of my noble friend lord de la warr <e> <s> it is a matter that we should consider very seriously <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word at this stage <e> <s> of course i have a vested interest in farming but i am emboldened to speak because i believe this to be a very important matter <e> <s> to refer to what my noble friend lord mottistone said a moment or two ago when he said that he felt everybody should be involved in insuring this strict liability risk <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> i do not agree with the thinking of my noble friend on that matter <e> <s> the law commission and the scottish law commission agreed on the main axiom that it is <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway was quite right when he raised the important point that we do not want a great deal of legal difficulty arising from now on because of this mistake <e> <s> however i know there are those in local government of the same political persuasion as myself who are concerned that there may be extra powers in this bill that should not be useable retrospectively upon the audited accounts of individual authorities <e> <s> it is that worry and that worry alone which concerns me <e> <s> if that is unlikely to happen i am much more content with the bill as it is than i should be otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i also would like to thank my noble friend lord hardinge of penshurst for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to say a few words <e> <s> i think also i ought to congratulate my noble friend upon what i gather was an enjoyable all-party car trip that he organised last week-end <e> <s> i really want just to dot a few is and cross a few ts following what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one other aspect that i should like to mention <e> <s> it is very important that we manage to clear up this disaster as well as we possibly can not only for the environment and the landscape which is important and which has been spoken about <e> <s> i should not wish to detract at all from what has been said about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give this bill a word of welcome and i can assure your lordships that it will be brief but cordial <e> <s> i do not feel that it should really be regarded as a contentious measure because it is not the measure that is in fact going to privatise water and sewerage nor is it going to privatise a single electricity-generating enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a very brief word <e> <s> i come from lewes and i am also an lea appointed governor of a primary school in that area <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall say what i think without fear or favour <e> <s> i am very unhappy about what happened <e> <s> the governing body of the school in lewes i believe made a considerable mistake <e> <s> i do not want to see that happen again if it can be helped <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> there are few points on which i disagree with the government but i am anxious that my noble friend the minister should think hard about retaining the present environmental service charge system <e> <s> i believe that the regional river advisory committees in determining what those charges should be and how they are to be spent would be responsive to local pressures as they have been in the past <e> <s> they would perhaps therefore be more capable than any other <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking my noble friend lady blatch for introducing so well the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i welcome the bill as far as it goes <e> <s> i also congratulate mr favell its promoter in another place on doing something about this subject and particularly on getting as far as he has <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may mention one point <e>", "<cs> i should also like to say a few words in support of my noble friends amendment to the amendment <e> <s> as regards the rural areas it must be remembered that it is not merely about environment and scenery it is about rural people and those who earn their living in the country <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply cold comfort or no <e> <s> i am afraid that it is cold comfort <e> <s> i have pages of ammunition that i might have fired off at this stage but as i said i shall keep it for now <e> <s> with that said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one point and ask one question about the main amendments moved by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i am quite sure it is right to press on with this pilot scheme because that is the only way in which we shall learn more about this very complex problem <e> <s> however i wish to consider the situation that will arise after that scheme <e> <s> it appears that there is no power for the minister to charge the costs of these nitrate sensitive areas to the water plcs <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words in support of this amendment <e> <s> it is probably not an enormously significant amendment but it should not be lost sight of <e>", "<cs> nevertheless it will be a nuisance <e> <s> a dairy herd of cows with its followers will just be able to manage on the allowance where the farm is not on the main <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word or two in support of this amendment <e> <s> i start by saying that i happen to have certain agricultural contacts with brittany <e> <s> over time i have been impressed by the progress that it has made with its road building and how it manages to get the whole thing done more quickly from the time of decision to the time of execution and so forth <e> <s> i have wondered from time to time how owners and occupiers of property fared <e> <s> i have always gathered over there that first the owners and occupiers did not make a fortune out of it but that it was not a disaster either <e> <s> all affected got some improvement out of it <e> <s> they got a little more land they at least got a better layout and those who were displaced were satisfactorily reinstated elsewhere <e> <s> i do not know the full details <e>", "<cs> i welcome amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it will deal with what we referred to colloquially at second reading as the garden-only case <e> <s> i am quite sure that that is all to the good <e> <s> i am very pleased to see that something has been done to clarify this situation <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i should like to ask a question <e> <s> he is taking away something which i believe to be an old prescriptive right of the farmer <e> <s> it is that agricultural livestock should be permitted to drink any water indigenous to the farm <e> <s> that is being whittled down to the proposed maximum <e> <s> i am not happy about the way in which the quantities have been set <e> <s> i should like to know from what source he received the agricultural advice that the amount was adequate and for how large a farm <e>", "<cs> my lords all the time the government plan to stick to the fundamental compulsory purchase rule of section of the act which is not a popular basis at all not only in my view but in that of many others <e> <s> what my noble friend suggests is an extremely important palliative which would help matters considerably <e> <s> i think that the government will have difficulty in persuading the public especially the property-owning public to the view that there is no difference between compulsory purchase for a nationalised industry and that for a public utility company <e> <s> as a matter of political judgment they will have difficulty over that issue <e> <s> that is why i believe that this palliative is a most significant one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord radnor on this amendment <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister will look at it closely and do his best to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am pleased that we appear to be getting near to some resolution of this matter of charges in rural areas <e> <s> it is very important because the disquiet in rural areas has remained all this time <e> <s> i should like my noble friend the minister when he comes to reply to endeavour to make clear to us as regards amendment no <e> <s> without amendment no <e> <s> exactly what powers the director general will have to stop discrimination against a rural population <e> <s> that is the one point about which i should like him to be as clear as possible <e>", "<cs> i must express some anxiety as regards this amendment very much on the lines of the comments made by the noble lord lord hylton particularly with reference to the rural context <e> <s> it is vitally important bearing in mind how restricted housing resources are in villages not to make matters worse for the elderly who wish to remain where they have reason to live <e> <s> this matter is going to become more difficult <e> <s> it is the factor that led me not to agree with a previous proposal of my noble friend lord swinfen <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that my noble friend lord stanley may be right about this matter <e> <s> low cost housing in rural areas is certainly the most explosive rural issue <e> <s> it closely concerns all those who live and work in the countryside and it closely concerns the maintenance of the social structure of our villages as we have known them <e> <s> i am heartened indeed by the governments interest in this issue but i am not absolutely sure that they are right in taking staircasing the whole way <e> <s> i am very much influenced by the views of the national agricultural centre housing trust <e> <s> i set great store by and pay credit to the work of moira constable of that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i said that the repeal of paragraph of schedule to the housing act would create difficulties in the context of smaller rural communities <e> <s> i was extremely worried about that <e> <s> the repeal was put through at short notice <e> <s> it seems that the position has been somewhat though not altogether changed <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend said i think that it would be quite in order and much the best course to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have certain sympathies with this amendment of my noble friend lord stanley and of course i am also an interested party <e> <s> i still have the feeling that really this may be a misunderstanding which is causing a storm in a teacup <e> <s> i very much hope so <e> <s> it depends on the reply given by my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think she was very mollifying in committee when replying to my noble friend lord stanley <e> <s> however perhaps more light will be thrown upon the situation on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley for initiating this debate <e> <s> i was also pleased to hear that the minister had indicated that he intends to look again at the problems of tenancies and how they are progressing <e> <s> i must endeavour to declare a rather complicated interest <e> <s> i belong to a land-owning family but i am in fact a tenant within the family with all the professionals continuing to say he has got to pay an arms length rent <e> <s> i therefore understand some of the farming problems indeed i do touched upon by my noble friend lord stanley <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether my noble friend intends to press the amendment although he has been very aggressive in his amendments so far today but i hope he will not <e>"]
