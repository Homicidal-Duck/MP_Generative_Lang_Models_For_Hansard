["<cs> my lords i am deeply conscious of the privilege of rising in your lordships house to speak for the first time <e> <s> i do so with diffidence and i must confess a degree of apprehension <e> <s> i know that i must do my best to be uncontroversial about a subject on which noble lords will not be surprised to hear i hold strong views <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that expression of sympathy <e> <s> i shall be even more grateful if that expression of sympathy is translated into action <e> <s> in the light of what he has said i am content to beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this time <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has explained the governments thinking in this matter <e> <s> i am still a little concerned about how this code of ethics can possibly be policed <e> <s> one must not confuse the right of the advocate to consult his client because he does so in order to get his clients instructions and to make up his mind about his client <e> <s> it is also perfectly proper for an advocate to consult an expert witness <e> <s> the purpose of that exercise is to be properly instructed so that the advocate can cross-examine the expert witness for the other side <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i am a little concerned about this amendment in so far as it deals with the matter covered in new subsection a the question of the precedence of courts <e>", "<cs> if i understand what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said he will not take the amendment away and consider it <e> <s> i fully understand what he has said <e> <s> however i do not understand what he said about the importance of establishing an order of precedence <e> <s> as i understand it he said that in any case any rules made by the council of the law society are subject to the approval of the lord president <e> <s> the poor old lord president will have a difficult job if subsection a remains as it is <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall be forgiven for intervening again <e> <s> we know perfectly well that the faculty has rules about the order of precedence and the obligations of an advocate in relation to instructions to appear in particular courts <e> <s> however there must be flexibility here <e> <s> this subsection does not prescribe that the law societys rules shall as nearly as possible correspond with those which apply to advocates <e> <s> i am making this point to be helpful and i am sure the committee will understand that <e> <s> surely what one could do to make a much better job of this subsection is to state that the council shall make the rules to which the new section is directed on the question of precedence of courts <e>", "<cs> for my part i think that i now understand what the government are trying to do which is to do good by stealth having been told what the objective is <e> <s> if i am satisfied that subsections and may result in the avoiding of greater danger of interference by a new or planned competition authority i shall be happy to accept the assurance that i have been given about the underlying thinking and to beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> a but we shall no doubt come to that in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i come back in the light of what the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar had to say <e> <s> at the moment the dean of faculty can order the suspension of any advocate against whom a complaint of professional misconduct has been made pending resolution and disposal of that complaint <e> <s> the object of this exercise is to introduce an equivalent power <e> <s> it cannot be the dean of faculty who will exercise it <e> <s> there is nothing equivalent to the dean of faculty in the law society of scotland <e> <s> the only person who can properly exercise the power is the lord president of the court of session <e> <s> he is in the best position to judge the necessity for instant suspension and the urgency with which that ought to be ordered <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> i am attempting to explain the thinking behind this and i am indebted to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for what he has said about the content of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey and i have given notice of our intention to object to the question <e> <s> it is no secret that i have always been deeply anxious about clause <e> <s> it is a poor clause for three reasons <e> <s> first the provisions introducing new section a are unnecessary in scotland <e> <s> any solicitor who believes that he can learn to become an advocate can if he applies himself and undergoes the training of pupillage readily become a member of faculty and be admitted to the public office of advocate <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question <e> <s> perhaps i did not hear what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> does he intend to tell us that there is anything in this bill which will make any solicitor who acquires a statutory right of audience a member of the college of justice <e> <s> is he going to suggest that there is anything in this bill which will make what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey calls a barefoot lawyer a member of the college of justice <e> <s> the two things are quite distinct <e> <s> to have a statutory right of audience is one thing to be a member of the college of justice is quite another <e> <s> if he can point out to me anything in this bill which innovates upon the constitution of the college of justice i shall be glad to hear it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would answer the question which i put with specific reference to the college of justice and the potential membership of that college of persons who acquire in one way or the other statutory rights of audience <e>", "<cs> it is in the act of union <e>"]
