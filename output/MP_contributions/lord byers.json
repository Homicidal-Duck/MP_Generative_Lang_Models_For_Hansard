["<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion moved by the noble lord lord peart and i wish from these benches to add our congratulations to the mover and seconder who have been entrusted with the special task of moving and seconding the loyal address <e> <s> they acquitted themselves in accordance with the highest traditions of this house and we are grateful to them for that <e> <s> we particularly appreciated the emphasis which both of them laid on our membership of the european community and i particularly appreciated the references by the noble lord lord camoys to the need for helping small businesses which can create more employment for our people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing the hope that in this new parliament minutes or for that matter will not be regarded as par for the course for any front bench speaker in any debate in this house <e> <s> as one of those perhaps the principal one who had these clocks put in this house i should like to offer the noble lord lord bruce of donington a new prescription for his eye-sight and his spectacles <e> <s> i welcome this debate on the budget not least because it gives the house an opportunity of hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord miles and we can look forward to that in <e> <s> i hope about minutes time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord goes any further in misinterpreting what i said i actually mentioned mcgahey and joe gormley <e> <s> i said it was right that he should have been slapped down <e> <s> but len murray for whom i have great respect has said that this will lead to industrial action <e> <s> this is an invitation to trade unions to take industrial action <e> <s> mr <e> <s> drain <e> <s> who is on the executive committee of the tuc has said that if necessary they will change the governments mind by industrial action <e> <s> this is unconstitutional <e> <s> it cannot be tolerated in a democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just get this absolutely right with the noble lord <e> <s> the point is that if a person in len murrays position as the leader of the tuc does not condemn the possibility of industrial action you are inviting individual trade unions to take that industrial action <e> <s> that is where the anarchy comes in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse everything the noble lord lord peart has said in thanking the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> this is very much an all-party matter affecting members in all quarters of the house <e> <s> there is no doubt that an adjustment was long overdue in the rate of the allowances <e> <s> on a matter of detail may i ask the noble lord how he interprets the phrase these increases in allowances should be introduced in full immediately <e> <s> for the sake of clarification does that mean from today or has the noble lord some other date in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say to the noble lord lord peart that perhaps he ought to go back to university and look at those examination papers which state that candidates need not attempt more than seven out of questions <e> <s> however there is much in the statement which we welcome unreservedly particularly the references to the appalling problem of the refugees <e> <s> we are particularly glad to know of the reassurance which was given regarding salt ii <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether or not he is aware that the report of the select committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord redcliffe-maud exposed that myth that it is not the document itself but only the signature of the attorney <e> <s> will he look at that report when he will see that what he has said just does not stand up in the light of the evidence <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is saying that the committee when it reported was totally wrong in the conclusion that it reached particularly as to the evidence which was given and which was refuted by the noble lord lord caccia who exposed the view of the foreign office that this was not authentication but merely authentication of the signature <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are strong supporters of regional policies but i must say that in the changed circumstances and while civil service manpower requirements are being reduced surely it would be right not to proceed with a very large dispersal programme <e> <s> therefore in principle i cannot follow the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> may i ask the leader of the house if in the case of those programmes which are to proceed allowances have been made for further reductions in the manpower requirements of the civil service <e> <s> secondly are there any dispersal programmes now in progress which may have to be reversed in part or in whole <e> <s> if so what arrangements will be made for the individuals so affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is more in order to congratulate the noble earl lord ferrers or to offer him our commiserations on his new responsibilities as we enter the winter of discontent but whichever is the more appropriate we offer in full measure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in many quarters his written answer is regarded as purely cosmetic <e> <s> when will the government take the decision to end the discriminatory operation of validating these negative certificates of origin <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts remembers telling the house that the british government that is the last government would never want to be seen ahead of the pack <e> <s> if that is so is it not time this government changed that policy and got ahead of the pack in the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement but i must tell him from these benches that we find the statement itself and the <e>", "<cs> my lords it puts prices up <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i think that it is very wise to have come to this decision but may i ask the government about their ultimate intentions so far as this bill is concerned and so far as the reform of this particular aspect of our life is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords without pressing the noble lord the leader of the house may i ask him whether he would not consider at an appropriate time not immediately that this is a matter upon which we ought to try to get some form of consensus within the parties and that in the process of reflection it might be a good idea to have both all-party talks and non-party talks <e>", "<cs> my lords may we also from these benches give full support to the noble lord the foreign secretary at a very very difficult time <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to say that we believe that the appointment of the noble lord lord soames as governor of rhodesia is a very good one indeed <e> <s> it is a challenge appropriate to the noble lords experience and competence and we wish him well in carrying out his new responsibilities <e> <s> of course the new acting leader of the house will have full support when he is right and a certain amount of sympathy when he is wrong in carrying out his duties <e> <s> however may i ask him this <e> <s> since as i understand it a considerable number of parliamentary business decisions are taken in the cabinet will the noble earl join that body during the temporary absence of the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> i think that it would be for the better arrangement of the business of the house if the noble earl were in the cabinet during this period <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he will expedite that request of mine to the direct channels lower down in this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin what is the final stage of the debate by thanking the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford for a most constructive speech and for showing how positive an approach can be adopted <e> <s> i find it quite incredible that anyone who listened to that speech could make the kind of speech that we heard from the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> what i think we on these benches find so detestable about the governments proposals in addition to their content is the way that they were brought about <e> <s> to us this was one of the nastier pranks included in the conservative party manifesto to obtain the votes of that part of the electorate which is openly or covertly racialist and having obtained those votes the government feel obliged to fulfil their immoral obligations <e> <s> in my view the pledge should never have been in the manifesto and certainly it is unlikely to represent the view of many people who voted conservative <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not make that point <e> <s> i made the point that if we can afford to absorb to every year of these people then you cannot use the argument that by increasing immigration by you are going to do people out of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords are there no major bills that we could take in this house at an early stage instead of the local government bill which we have now lost <e>", "<cs> it is the length of a parliament my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to follow in any detail what the noble lord lord lee of newton has said <e> <s> we can understand that the government wish not to intervene in this dispute and to leave it to the management the unions and acas <e> <s> may i ask the government whether they will consider seriously trying to clarify the situation for the public at large clarify it by publishing an up to date and authoritative statement of the facts which everybody can understand <e> <s> what for instance is the actual take-home pay of the major categories of steelworker in the public and private sectors at the moment <e> <s> does anybody really know that <e> <s> certainly i do not <e> <s> by how much would the productivity proposals increase wages and reduce costs if implemented to the full <e> <s> may we have any other relevant facts that would enable the public to understand what is involved <e> <s> it is a very difficult situation for any corporation making such losses as these to pay any increase in wages but we should be better advised if the public at large and we ourselves could know exactly what is in dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment before the noble viscount answers that question by suggesting to the house as a whole that when the noble viscount has replied we really will have had enough of this and that it is becoming a debate <e> <s> if that is the feeling of the house after the noble viscount has answered that question i hope that we might go on to the other business <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble baroness lady sharples for introducing this very important motion <e> <s> i am only sorry that it is not the subject of a long debate and that we are constrained to two and a half hours <e> <s> there has been an increasing if slow recognition over the past three years of the important part which the small firm can play in job creation in the reduction of unemployment and in the development of new and profitable ideas <e> <s> it is also coming to be recognised that a small firm starting up from scratch or expanding in size can make an important contribution to the regeneration of our derelict inner cities <e> <s> it is remarkable i think how one or two people with a bright idea good advice and adequate resources can develop an innovation whose production packaging marketing and dispatch gives employment to unskilled workers as the firm develops and there are many examples of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that answer may i ask him whether the government would not reconsider this matter in view of the vital importance of the publics being properly informed of the facts in any major dispute <e> <s> how many people know that a process worker in the steel industry today has a basic pay of per week or nearly a year <e> <s> how can we find out what could be earned by the new productivity agreement <e> <s> how can we find out what difference a new productivity agreement in such a dispute if fully implemented will make to the reduction of costs in the industry <e> <s> is it not about time that the government did something to make the public aware of what is really at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are not prepared to take the responsibility would it not be possible to ask acas to do this so that we could get an independent and authoritative view <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the government that we on this bench have very similar misgivings <e> <s> does the noble lord think that the time has come for the government to do something to get this dispute settled <e> <s> surely we cannot continue with this dialogue of the deaf for very many more weeks when we can see <e>", "<cs> my lords how many if any of the recommendations of the select committee have the government adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords good as the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the foreign secretary whether he sees a difference between the plo and the palestinian problem <e> <s> will he say yes or no whether he regards the plo as a terrorist organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that government departments are under instruction to settle bills promptly will he please inquire as to what is the actual practice <e> <s> would it not be possible in many cases to settle for per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> and then to argue about the rest <e> <s> the idea of holding up the whole of the payment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be your wish that i should resist the temptation to spend the next hour in trying to refute the speech we have just heard <e> <s> i shall read it with great care and i think i shall be in communication with the noble lord <e> <s> but for tonight and at this hour i should like simply to thank all those who have spoken in the debate and particularly the noble baroness lady sharpies who made a very good four-minute speech <e> <s> i hope that will be recorded <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question my noble friend has put <e> <s> what about access to equipment and installations <e> <s> is the answer yes or no <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches would certainly wish to be associated with the expression of good wishes to zimbabwe on assuming independence <e> <s> we certainly welcome the decision made by the government to grant this amount of aid to a country which will certainly need it <e> <s> may i ask <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble baroness has just said and the fact that there is as i understand it another inquiry taking place into the earnings rule does it mean that the government have gone back on their pledge in the manifesto to get rid of this earnings rule during the lifetime of this parliament <e> <s> if so this is a very important statement of policy it is quite a new development <e> <s> does that pledge still stand a pledge upon which a great many people voted conservative or in the light of what the noble baroness has said now has that pledge been abandoned <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point that i am making <e> <s> does what the noble baroness has said tonight mean that the pledge given in the manifesto no longer stands <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> has it been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> may i press the noble baroness and say that the real test here is the lifetime of this parliament <e> <s> that was the manifesto pledge <e> <s> does that still stand <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the sympathetic way in which he has received the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> of course i am aware that the occupational pensions board is studying this matter and i would not dream of pressing him for a definite <e>", "<cs> i would be very happy to do that and with the leave of the committee i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether anybody is working on this problem to try to obtain an agreed view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that what has really offended the occupational therapists for whom i speak and other professions for whom the noble baroness speaks is the total lack of appreciation in this report of the magnificent contribution which these professions make to the rehabilitation of very serious cases of injury and handicap <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether the government will recognise this as a pretty shoddy piece of workmanship on the part of clegg <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of my colleagues on these benches warmly endorse everything that the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said and welcome home most warmly the noble lord the leader of the house we all feel tremendous admiration for a very difficult job extremely well done without even incurring the usual transfer fee for the four to six months that he has been away <e> <s> it was a remarkable achievement and our congratulations and gratitude go not only to the noble lord but to lady soames who clearly has been a tremendous help to her husband in bringing about a successful solution to a very difficult situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say from these benches that we find those arrangements perfectly acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the emphasis on simplifying the work of the civil service and carrying it out more efficiently is absolutely right <e> <s> i am equally sure that the government must have benefited greatly from the work of sir derek rayner <e> <s> of course any <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington has very much enjoyed his knockabout turn <e> <s> on this occasion i do not want to speak from a party point of view but i think it only right that i should speak against a background of a good deal of experience which i have been fortunate enough to have in international business <e> <s> i think it a pity that the noble lord lord bruce should have denigrated mr ian macgregor who is going to have a very difficult task indeed <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry my lords but one could not listen to that speech without realising that it contained a good deal of denigration <e> <s> but let me develop this theme <e> <s> i have known and worked with ian macgregor for over years in the mining and metals field <e> <s> he is a man of great competence <e> <s> he has great ability <e> <s> he is internationally renowned <e> <s> of course he is not known by everyone but some of us those of us who have worked with him have come to respect tremendously his judgment and ability <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl <e> <s> does he really mean what he has now said twice that is that the government must tell mr macgregor exactly what to do <e> <s> that is not the right concept of management at all <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord also take the trouble to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord when he thinks the debate on the iran sanctions orders is going to come on tonight <e> <s> if it is going to be any time after oclock it will be quite wrong in our view to take them at such a late hour <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask as a resident of lambeth whether the noble lord is aware that the rates in lambeth this year went up by per cent <e> <s> which is a very heavy burden on those who live there <e> <s> is he also aware that there is tremendous scope for cutting down non-essential services and for a thorough <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> i propose to comment on only one aspect of it <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that to many of us the proposal that the plo should be a party to negotia <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord clarify one point in his answer to me <e> <s> can he say whether the nine will insist before the plo is associated with negotiations on the acceptance by the plo of the right of israel to exist <e> <s> this is a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> with all respect to the chief whip we are in the middle of a vote <e> <s> we are in the middle of a motion <e> <s> it has been put once by the chair and surely we must dispose of that before we proceed to the next business <e>", "<cs> i do not conceal the fact that i do not like the principle which has been introduced of penalising the occupational pensioner but nothing which has been said from the front bench opposite has persuaded me that this figure of is adequate <e> <s> it is a bad starting figure <e> <s> what i dislike is the suggestion that this is really brought in because there is an abuse <e> <s> it is going to hit the unemployed person who is genuinely wanting work is living in the right place but is not able to get work <e>", "<cs> i was very disappointed indeed at the attitude of the noble lord lord sandys and i was worried by a statement he made and i am not sure whether he realises exactly what he said <e> <s> as i understood him he said retirement from work could not be entirely unforeseen <e> <s> that is what is happening today people are not able to get jobs and are forced to retire <e> <s> that is not something they have foreseen <e> <s> i am worried that we are being bedevilled by this per cent <e> <s> of people who say they do not really want work <e> <s> it means that per cent <e> <s> of people are genuinely seeking work <e> <s> if there are people taking unemployment benefit who do not wish to work that should be treated as the abuse which it is and should not affect those who are genuinely seeking work and whom this will catch in a very bad way <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany said here was an opportunity for the government at least to be sympathetic towards this idea and perhaps to have said they would have another look at it <e> <s> i regard this as a potential injustice to a large number of people and if the government are not prepared to have another look at it the committee should press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i do not think that would be satisfactory either to the noble lord lord wells-pestell or to those on these benches <e> <s> if the noble lord will say he will have another look at this and come back with something positive on report i should be willing to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> if not i should like to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> that was in regard to the previous amendment <e> <s> what is the cost of this amendment <e> <s> will it really be very much <e>", "<cs> my lords could we not occasionally have quality rather than quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give some indication of the timing of this matter <e> <s> how soon after the report has been received from the committee is it likely that her majestys government will bring this matter to both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> i will therefore rephrase the question my lords <e> <s> how soon after that may we expect to have discussion in this house so that consultations can take place <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to express our very sincere thanks to black rod and his staff and the property service agency and all those who have managed this remarkable transformation in such a short time <e> <s> we in this house are very well served by those who look after our comforts and those who enable us to despatch business as usual in the face of an emergency or even a semi-crisis <e> <s> i hope there is no connection between the judgment from above which took place last night and the fact that the government were defeated four times on the floor of the house yesterday because i must warn the noble lord that it is going to happen again and i hope this chamber is more secure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support what the noble lord lord soames and the noble lord lord peart have said about the great work that the noble lord lord boyle has done for so many people in public life <e> <s> i should like to thank not only him but all who work with him on the top salaries review body <e> <s> on the question of junior ministers in the house of lords this nettle must be grasped <e> <s> they have not really been treated properly for a considerable number of years <e> <s> i hope that this problem will now be taken on board and that proper arrangements will be made for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord peart has just said <e> <s> despite the efforts of the staff the conditions under which we are now operating are not conducive to efficiency for more than a few days <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could initiate the improvement of conditions until we are in recess by having more loudspeakers and more microphones and also by raising the benches if that is possible so that we may operate in more normal conditions <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord i say this quite seriously because in this chamber we are subjected to new strains when this ceiling was last inspected <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> this is not the first time that we have had to protest from the opposition benches whatever government is in power <e> <s> when we get an overload of work on the parliamentary system such as we have had in this session there is a serious risk of very bad legislation as a result <e> <s> i know it is too late to do anything about it now but may i plead with the noble lord the leader of the house to ask his colleagues in another place to start planning the next sessions work now so that we get a proper balance of work and do not run into this problem as we seem to do practically every other session <e>", "<cs> my lords surely this is a matter for parliament as a whole <e> <s> we really must know what is happening in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we are going to hear from the government whether what the noble baroness has said is to be confirmed <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> my lords on this new motion i really do think that we must make a protest because it is not just a matter of discourtesy <e> <s> it is a question of knowing what the intentions of the government are going to be <e> <s> so far as the third reading of this bill in this house is concerned we ought to be aware of what their intentions are in another place <e> <s> i think it is very important that we should divide the house on this motion to suspend the sitting of the house during pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for what he has said which i think was a perfectly adequate statement which the house should accept without difficulty at all <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord realise that by insisting on the plo having a place in the middle east peace negotiations one is enhancing the status of an organisaton which is financed by gaddafi and armed by the russians and that this will create even further tension in a very sensitive area of the middle east and allow the russians a spearhead on the frontiers of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who have been fortunate enough to meet the queen mother on numerous occasions over a long period of public life have been able to identify with no difficulty at all those characteristics which have inspired in all of us the admiration and affection which we feel for her <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what she meant when she said there were no plans at present for a wage freeze <e> <s> does she realise the difference between a wage freeze and an incomes policy <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is not going to respond immediately to that may i ask him if he would make it clear to his colleagues in another place the feeling on this side of the house on this matter and have further discussions with them so that he could make an informed statement perhaps tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord how he obtained the intelligence that these two supplementary questions were going to be asked <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to endorse everything that has been said <e> <s> the property services agency and the staff of the house have done a remarkable job and we ought to be very grateful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not accept that it would be extremely unfortunate if this european initiative were in any way to confuse or undermine the camp david arrangements that are already under way <e>", "<cs> my lords how can that be when there is a profit of million a year <e> <s> this cannot be logically correct <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may press the noble lord and ask him whether that means he would be prepared to come forward with a properly structured amendment at report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord as one who has been interested in this question for some time at what intervals these buses will be leaving <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not realise that there is a precedent not for governments talking to boundary commissions but for representatives of all parties speaking to them on such matters as are worrying the parties <e> <s> in fact i was a member of such a delegation to the boundary commission in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i endorse exactly what the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe has said <e> <s> this is a matter of some constitutional importance <e> <s> not only is there a relevant bill going through this house but when one house is sitting parliament is sitting and the purpose of a statement is that it should enable the opposition in particular to question ministers and the government on the content of that statement <e> <s> i hope that we can make this protest in terms which will enable us to say that it will never be repeated in this form <e>", "<cs> my lords would we be right to conclude that the chief whip himself had no notice of this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise a point of information <e> <s> if the wives of peers do not require passes because they are known to the servants of the house why do we have them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what instructions the government gave to the gas corporation on prices <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord think it fair to say that the responsibility for apprenticeship standards and everything connected with apprenticeships lies with the employer <e> <s> surely in matters like the period of time required to achieve a certain standard the trade unions have a very big responsibility in responding to the pressures that are already building up to reduce the period of apprenticeship training while still retaining the relevant standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this motion and to extend my compliments to the two noble lords the mover and the seconder of the humble address on the way they have discharged the duties for which they were deservedly selected by the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> i remember well the father of the noble earl lord de la warr buck de la warr <e> <s> many of us on these benches had much respect and affection for him even though he was a member of practically every one of the great parties of his day except our own <e> <s> he certainly got around <e> <s> i congratulate the noble earl also as a fellow deputy lieutenant of a neighbouring county <e>", "<cs> i have done my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord alport on the way in which he presented this measure to your lordships house today <e> <s> i must say however that i feel very much in two minds about the bill itself <e> <s> first i am not a great supporter of the referendum device as a basis for constitutional or any other reform <e> <s> i was doubtful about the wisdom of using it in the case of our joining the eec but given the unrepresentative nature of the house of commons itself we on these benches thought i think that it would be better to accept the referendum as a second best <e> <s> nevertheless i am worried about the way in which we are extending the use of the referendum in our political life <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that a referendum held on the return of capital punishment would almost certainly return a yes vote despite the massive evidence available which does not support capital punishment as an effective deterrent <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been on this statement now for minutes <e> <s> may i ask the government chief whip whether it is not about time that the house moved back to the main debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i also rise to oppose this bill and i am helped in doing this by the very strong case put forward with all his experience behind him of the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> but before i develop a slightly different argument against this bill i must declare an interest in that i have for the last few years been a consultant to a large well-known retail organisation not at all i hasten to add on this aspect of their work <e> <s> but they would be seriously hurt if ever this bill got on to the statute book and it is only right that i should refer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not press the noble lord <e> <s> i merely got that information from his office the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords is not that the estimate for every single meter in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would also wish to be associated in full with the congratulations and good wishes expressed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to his royal highness the prince of wales and the lady diana <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a question of asking for an assurance from the government at all <e> <s> the question put by my noble friend lady seear was what undertakings or commitments were given by the trade union movement so that the corporate plan of the british steel corporation would have a chance of succeeding <e> <s> in the statement there is no reference whatever to consultation or to commitments undertaken not by the government but by the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the leader of the house would appreciate that in his endeavours to solve this problem he will have a very great deal of support from all quarters of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to thank the noble lord for his statement <e> <s> we shall do our best to carry on the business of the house in his absence for a week <e> <s> we cannot guarantee that everything will run as smoothly as it normally does <e> <s> we hope that the noble lord will have a very successful mission successful in the sense that as a result zimbabwe will be much better off <e>", "<cs> my lords when does the noble lord think that the first assessment will be able to be made and when shall we know what is the result <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can indicate the likely subject matters of these statements <e> <s> most of us are in the dark <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are particularly appreciative of the tributes paid to our <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would agree that sometimes it is necessary to

<s> i can only reflect that the noble lord should count himself lucky at not being charged by the minute <e>", "<cs> i wish to take this opportunity to thank the noble lord lord young for raising this matter <e>", "<cs> i suggest to the minister that this is about the right time in this parliamentary session to put down a marker for the next parliamentary session and then with any luck we shall get the priority we have been demanding for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm to the house that it is illegal to recruit mercenaries in this country <e> <s> it must be <e>", "<cs>

deal with the day-to-day working of nationalised industries by asking a question in another place <e> <s> such a question would be stopped by the table <e> <s> it would not be allowed to go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the fact that the statement has been made although we welcome it in principle because i assume it is far too early for the noble lord lord bellwin to be in a position to answer any questions such as we might wish to put to him on matters of detail while negotiations are going on and a consortium is being formed <e> <s> if this turns out to be a co-operative it will be an exciting and interesting venture <e> <s> but if it does not i take it that it would be a public company in which the public would have the right to invest and that there would be provision for the employees in the company to have a shareholding in it <e> <s> bearing in mind the position that the national freight corporation has established as a pace-setter and an upholder of high standards in the industry i would also assume that there would be a strong case for it retaining some kind of stake in the new company or consortium so that it could insist upon the standards that we wish to see in this country <e>", "<cs> i should first like to say to the noble earl that these ideas have been developing over the past few months and i believe that it is a good idea that we should debate and discuss them <e> <s> i believe that the noble earl and i have a lot in common in thinking along these lines <e> <s> but i think i am a little ahead of him partly because i have had some experience of raising relatively large sums of money many millions in a team which did it for mining in different parts of the world <e> <s> these were not nationalised industries but the principle was absolutely clear <e> <s> it was that we raised money from the financial institutions and we negotiated the terms in such a way that the risk was taken by those financial institutions at a price <e>

this moment to answer my noble friends question on the discretion of the returning officer <e> <s> it is a very important fact <e> <s> that is what we want to know <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of noble lords on these benches i wish wholeheartedly to support the motion now before the house <e> <s> the engagement of the heir to the throne has already given great pleasure to millions of people in this country and elsewhere <e> <s> that pleasure stems largely from the fact that the forthcoming marriage obviously commends itself to her majesty the queen and to prince philip and to the affection which prince charles and the lady diana spencer have for one another <e>", "<cs> my lords the two noble and learned lords who have just spoken knew the noble and learned lord lord widgery far better than i did although on many occasions when i met him i must say that i was deeply indebted to him for the friendship which he showed to me <e> <s> we on these benches would like to associate ourselves

was on the rate of capital expenditure and the timing <e> <s> may i ask him whether that is true <e> <s> what they said was that you should not cut services in order to pay for capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly those who have supported the motion <e> <s> i think we can claim that we certainly had the weight of numbers on our side and the weight of argument as well <e> <s> i must say i am disappointed with the governments reply and the weakness of their case <e> <s> no one has ever claimed i think that the government should surrender decisions on the external services to the bbc <e> <s> all that has been claimed is that the governments decision is an error of judgment because they are confusing capital expenditure on re-equipment for audibility with current expenditure on the services and we believe that those should be kept absolutely separate <e> <s> we believe that the latter should not be cut in order to help to pay the capital bills <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of myself and my noble friends on this bench i wish to support the tributes which have just been made to the late president sadat <e> <s> he was a man of immense courage both political and physical <e> <s> he had lived for many years a life of constant risk <e> <s> his political courage was demonstrated by his imaginative initiative in going to israel and signing a peace treaty with mr <e> <s> begin in an attempt to bring genuine peace to the middle east <e> <s> as chairman of the anglo-israel

baroness this question since members of this house have access to the crown just as members of the house of commons have access to the crown would it not be logical that matters involving members of this house and any members of the public should be remitted to the ombudsman <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would reconsider the reply that she gave to me because it may unwittingly be misleading <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the convention in another place is still as it was when i was there <e> <s> a constituent should take up a matter with his or her own member and not with any member <e> <s> that convention is a very important one <e> <s> if it is not obeyed a lot of difficulty occurs in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish to be fully supportive of what has been said on this very sad occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion moved by the noble lord lord peart and to add my congratulations to the mover and the seconder of the humble address for the competence with which they discharged these duties and the pleasure which they gave to the house in doing so <e> <s> i congratulate too the leader of the house on her selection of the two noble lords entrusted with this task <e> <s> i must tell her however that i am somewhat confused as to the basis on which this selection is made <e> <s> in my days in the other place this honour was reserved for those who were destined for high office <e> <s> perhaps this is still the aim let us hope that it is but i have not noticed in this parliament that movers and seconders of the humble address have found themselves suddenly the holders of important portfolios worthy as they all were <e> <s> in fact a study of those selected by the government for this signal honour shows a strong sense of conservatism <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would also wish to be associated with the many tributes paid to the reverend robert bradford and we offer our most sincere sympathies to his widow and his family <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can clear up a point <e> <s> it was reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord comment on the disavowal by the saudi government of their representative at the united nations when they have said that he was in no position to make a statement that israel was included in that list <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is true <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will explain <e> <s> let me put this to the noble lord <e> <s> in fact the government have cut operating expenditure on these programmes by million a year in the next three years and they have decided to cut the capital expenditure programme by another million in and <e> <s> the reason why they have not cut the capital programme by million next year is that it has been cut so much already <e> <s> there is nothing more to cut <e> <s> i want to ask whether the noble lord will confirm that this arithmetic is correct and answer the question what happens from onwards <e> <s> what is there in the long-term programme which will give reassurance to the bbc about its external services <e>", "<cs> or jimmy young <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it has been explained by the procedure or another committee that it is undesirable when a minister has sat down after answering an unstarred question for the debate to be continued by a series of noble lords asking him questions <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord get in touch with the bbc to see what can be done <e> <s> if it is not going to cost any more money why should we not have the extra service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it is not a fact that the medway enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that there have been tremendous advances in the past year or two in co-operation between the private sector and the public sector both local and central in inner city regeneration and that that is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would wish to be associated in full with the tributes just paid by the leader of the house and by the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> i count it as my good fortune that i served in the other place in the parliament with politicians and statesmen of stature from all parties of whom rab butler was an outstanding example <e> <s> it was a fine parliament and he shouldered a heavy workload in leading for the opposition in many of the major debates of that exacting period of radical reforms <e> <s> before that he had many achievements in his career pre-war on the india bill as an influential proponent of speedier re-armament as has been mentioned the education bill and for the next years he was deeply immersed in practically all the major measures and important political issues as a leading member of the government or the opposition <e> <s> indeed he did have a remarkable political record <e> <s> at all times he was charming and courteous and he was often mischievous <e> <s> those who knew him will never forget that inimitable chortle and the glint of fun in his eyes <e> <s> i wish that we could have seen and heard more of him in this house but whenever he did come it was to very good purpose indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the foreign secretary for his very clear exposition of the bill and what we wish to achieve <e> <s> it enables me to be briefer than i should normally have been although i am usually brief because i agree entirely with the case which he has made out <e> <s> last summer in the absence overseas of mr david steel i was approached by the canadian foreign minister mr mcquigan on this matter and he asked me where the liberal party stood <e> <s> i had no hesitation in telling him that the canadian government would have the full support of liberals in the united kingdom if they asked for the patriation of the canadian constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord at this stage suggesting that we shall be asked to amend this bill <e> <s> does he not realise that that is not possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might put it to the noble baroness speaking as one who was a member of the three-man committee in that it might be worth while to seek another examination of the possibility of reforming the house of lords by a committee of this house only in order to give some idea to the other place of what is at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches certainly hope and pray as the foreign secretary said that there will be a peaceful solution to this appalling situation and that the falkland islanders will be restored to the way of life which they have enjoyed for so long <e> <s> i do not think there is any point in recriminations at this stage but when the appropriate time does come there will i think be the need for some very searching questions particularly as to why the british reaction was so incredibly slow and there did not appear to have been a contingency plan <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that that shaft has gone home quite deeply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recognise on behalf of the government that the plo is nothing but a terrorist organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will make it clear that there are two separate organisations here <e> <s> one with whose founding i was concerned is the london enterprise agency which as the noble lord said is an organisation backed by the private sector particularly for helping small businesses secondly there is the greater london development board which is the child of the glc <e> <s> these are two separate organisations working together <e>", "<cs> my lords when will these two brand new carriers be commissioned <e> <s> what date <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what would be the cash sum reouired to meet the government offer to the hospital workers and how much extra in cash would be required to meet their demands <e>", "<cs> my lords too should like to thank the noble baroness for the way in which she has opened the debate the house is very grateful to her <e> <s> on the rd april in this house i stated our position on these benches as being that of hoping for a peaceful solution to the appalling situation created by the invasion of the falkland islands and as supporting the government in backing their diplomatic stance with a substantial military force <e> <s> i see no reason to change that view <e> <s> i believe that the principle that we must constantly reiterate as the noble baroness did if we are to maintain world opinion on our side is that unprovoked aggression must not be permitted as a means of settling any dispute and that wherever possible the aggressor must not be allowed to benefit from his aggressive act <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for raising this question of the community enterprise programme and particularly the plight of elephant jobs <e> <s> i have been in correspondence with the secretary of state for employment and the manpower services commission over elephant jobs in the past few weeks <e> <s> i was grateful for the extension of their life by three months but as the noble lord said this time is running out and so far as i can see they are due to close by the end of june <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene when the noble lord is taling about elephant jobs is he giving any credit at all to the life skills which are taught at elephant jobs <e> <s> to get a playground made is quite different to bringing people in at oclock and teaching them the life skills they need for work <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not much in the speech of

importance of it <e> <s> if i understood the statement correctly it represents a welcome retreat from the december white paper and acceptance of a great deal of the manpower services commissions youth task group report <e> <s> i hope that is correct for that is the way i read it <e> <s> if so this represents a very important and welcome shift of policy away from the present concept of finding something for the unemployed -year-old to do with a little training thrown in in favour of a two-year training scheme for - and -year-olds to provide them with special skills and higher standards

that the intention to sell off per cent <e> <s> of british telecom can at this stage be offered a cautious welcome though i must say that for over two years some of us have contended that to inhibit british telecom from raising investment finance on the open market has been absolutely totally illogical and that provided the government do not give a guarantee the investment finance raised on the open market should not count against the public sector borrowing requirement <e> <s> this is the illogicality of the myth of the treasury and we shall have this argument about other organisations that
