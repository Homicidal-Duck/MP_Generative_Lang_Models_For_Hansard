["<cs> my lords i owe your lordships house an apology <e> <s> i have been privileged to be a member of your lordships house for four years but this is the first time that i have spoken <e> <s> my reason for speaking tonight is that i have for just over seven years been a bishop in a multiracial situation <e> <s> i reckon myself to be inhibited by the traditions of a maiden speech from scoring some of the points regarding racism and sexism that seem to be implied in the white paper <e> <s> indeed if i were not inhibited i would not want to make them <e> <s> i would rather try to look at what seems to me to be positive steps forward that need to be taken and which i regard these rules as not helping to be taken <e>"]
