["<cs> my lords i address your lordships house for the first time very duly conscious of the honour of doing so <e> <s> in taking part in the debate on the gracious speech i feel an additional sense of privilege <e> <s> i am reminded in doing so of one of my proudest memories in another place when at the opening of a previous session of parliament i had the great privilege of thanking her majesty through a motion of thanks <e> <s> on that occasion also i knew for only the second time in another place the privilege of making a speech without interruption <e> <s> i understand that i shall have a clear run again today <e> <s> i hope sincerely that i shall adhere to the tradition of being non-controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to have the considerable honour and pleasure to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of sheffield on his maiden speech <e> <s> it may interest him to know that i count it an extra pleasure above what it would possibly be for anyone else for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that it is a very short time ago that i made my maiden speech so i had some conception of how he felt tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at once to join others who have spoken in paying tribute to the work of the committee under the chairmanship of his royal highness and to lord seebohm for introducing this very useful debate <e> <s> it was appropriate that the royal commissions report of should be commemorated in this useful way <e> <s> i greatly <e>", "<cs> i wish only to comment on clause stand part <e> <s> having sat through the discussions on the various amendments i feel particularly strongly on the last debate we had on clause which was on campaigns <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter when speaking to an early amendment suggested that there would be many who would be looking for ways of driving holes through this piece of legislation <e> <s> i have some experience in the north-east of england and i can think of no better way for holes to be driven through this proposed legislation than in the sphere of campaigns <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to take very seriously the threat in this regard <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness for her comments on the amendment that i have proposed <e> <s> i have listened to my noble friend who as he said accepts the principle embodied in the amendment <e> <s> he has made me feel quite happy that the matter will be looked at carefully in the future as it was a probing amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his support of the proposed amendment <e> <s> i am grateful also to my noble friend for the way in which he has responded to it <e> <s> i take the point that this may not be the right moment but it is encouraging to know that the principle is accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether in his further consideration of the water industry he will take into due account that the statutory water companies have tried always to put <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed some quite accurate figures produced recently <e> <s> has he noted that in the financial year just ended english estates achieved in the north-east of england which certainly has its unemployment problems a per cent <e> <s> increase in lettings of factories and workshops which represents just over new places of employment and new jobs <e> <s> has he further noted that on monday of this week the twelfth japanese factory attracted to the north-east of england by government policies and encouragement was opened <e> <s> the same policies are revitalising the town of consett until recently wholly dependent on steel production <e>", "<cs> it seems a very long time ago that the noble lord lord ezra in moving this amendment said that the intention of the bill was to give the gas industry greater freedom <e> <s> that is what privatisation means as i understand it <e>", "<cs> i find myself in some difficulty in agreeing with this amendment <e> <s> i come from the north-east of england where in regional terms there has been an almost constant dialogue and discussion with successive governments on the comparison between the english regions and the countries of scotland and wales <e> <s> the population of scotland at this time if i remember rightly is something like million <e> <s> the population of england is million <e> <s> if we are to have a special assistant director for scotland and another for wales what about another ten for the various english regions <e> <s> this seems to me to be an unfair and unreasonable suggestion <e> <s> once again if i may i will suggest to your lordships that in terms of the regions of england it is a wholly unfair suggestion <e> <s> i therefore wish to oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord sefton has left his place <e> <s> i should have liked to tell him directly in response to his remark that few of us are standing up in defence of the governments policies with regard to social welfare that i am very happy to do just that <e> <s> i am very proud of what my government have achieved through their policies in the face of many difficulties over the past seven years <e> <s> i am grateful like other noble lords to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for initiating the debate <e> <s> the noble lord made a comparison between labour and conservative policies suggesting that they were distinct <e> <s> i suppose that in many ways they are <e> <s> however his remarks remind me of a debate in another place in which i took part a few years ago on a very similar subject to that being discussed today <e>", "<cs> my lords having knowledge of the water research centre i should like to support very much the comments that the noble lord lord sherfield has just made <e> <s> i would with him express the hope that research and development in the water industry will be continued post-privatisation at the level at which it has been done in the past <e> <s> the centre is very valuable and i hope that it can be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there has been a highly successful conference organised by the north-east development council quite recently in darlington on the work opportunities which the building of the tunnel represents <e> <s> there is no doubt at all in that area which is famed for its engineering of the value of this project <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the speech made by the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> it is a few years ago now but i once initiated in another place a debate on the problems facing small and medium-sized businesses <e> <s> as a consequence of having initiated that debate and also being very conscious indeed of the considerable problems that face small businesses at this time i have sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> i therefore appeal to my noble friend to consider such an advisory body <e> <s> with the noble lord lord bruce i feel that small businesses have a great deal to contribute to our national well-being and to the national economy as a whole <e>", "<cs> i interject only on one point <e> <s> i wholly agree with the noble lord lord stoddart on the responsibility of landlords with regard to installation <e> <s> i do not think that there is any argument there <e> <s> landlords should be required to install safe appliances <e> <s> however there is the other half of the problem which the noble lord lord stoddart raised which concerns maintenance <e> <s> i think that one ought to give a thought here to the responsibility of tenants as against landlords <e> <s> can landords always know whether appliances are being reasonably maintained by tenants <e> <s> is not a somewhat unfair responsibility being proposed in this new clause for landlords in that tenants are bound to have a better idea whether an appliance is safe and working than <e>", "<cs> i intervene only briefly <e> <s> when i listened to the noble lord lord stoddart it occurred to me that that which he was advocating the long-term plan for this industry or any industry was exactly what the nationalisation acts were all about <e> <s> a banner headline was before us at breakfast time in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that those of us who are aware of the unemployment problem particularly in the areas from which we come will welcome very much the speech this morning of my noble friend lord young <e> <s> i should particularly like to emphasise the point he made about the success of the enterprise allowance <e> <s> he mentioned the town of sunderland where the success of the enterprise allowance has been such that an amazing number of unemployed people have started up their own businesses <e> <s> this applies also to derwentside in the north-east of england <e> <s> i think that this is the most encouraging feature of the present governments considerable efforts with regard to unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the speech of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and i very much appreciated as i am sure we all did his sincerity in expressing his fears on the industrial imbalance between north and south and the consequences which he and others fear because of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that that part of his statement which suggested the achievement in percentage terms of near balance between the employment position in humberside and the south of the country will help further to dispel the very damaging suggestion that there are two nations within the one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer which indicates a greatly increased level of investment <e> <s> will my noble friend accept that investment at newcastle has brought into being a splendid international airport which is of the greatest assistance to the region in this period of industrial change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to follow the noble lord lord ardwick in that i step off a train in newcastle most weeks <e> <s> i can confirm what he says about the wine bars the boutiques and the town hall which looks like a cathedral <e> <s> it is an efficient town hall <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will find time to visit it <e> <s> although it is largely true that unemployment is invisible i should like to return to that point and others that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer suggestive as it is of considerable progress <e> <s> however as there are still quite a number of areas in all parts of the country that have enormous congestion can he say whether bypasses have priority in the national road plan and how many schemes are in the current programme <e>", "<cs> my lords it is some years ago since in another place i took part in the debates on devolution which have already been referred to by the noble lord lord cocks the original bill before us and then eventually the bills proposing separate parliaments for scotland and wales <e> <s> the noble lord has recalled the opposition to them <e> <s> i was part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to follow in this debate my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> my noble friend has a very detailed knowledge indeed of the water industry which i think we all recognise him to have <e> <s> in fact i think his experience in the water industry is possibly unique <e> <s> i do however have some experience myself and i declare an interest <e> <s> i am at this time chairman of one of the bigger statutory companies <e> <s> i am a vice-president of the water companies association and for years i had the honour to be the president of that body <e>", "<cs> my lords let me briefly and sincerely thank my noble friend for having so ably met the point of my original amendment moved in committee <e> <s> the amendment does as he suggested meet a legislative anomaly <e> <s> it means in effect that in future workers in statutory water companies and it would seem also in harbour authorities will be able to determine the pension of their choice in line with workers in other industries <e> <s> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the northern region where we have had and continue to have pit closures in february of last year our regional unemployment rate was per cent <e> <s> while in february this year it was per cent <e> <s> and is still falling <e> <s> will he continue to encourage those policies which have brought a large number of new much needed industries to the northern region <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the generally most splendid figures that he has quoted include the information that in the northern region which has certainly known its unemployment problems the number of those unemployed for six months or more has fallen by within the last months and that every single economic indicator in the region suggests that the fall will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the urban development corporations have played an enormous part already in regenerating urban areas <e> <s> is he aware that the tyne and wear development corporation is celebrating its first birthday and has already earmarked billion in public and private funding for a remarkably small geographical area on the banks of the tyne and wear <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take fully into account the amazing rise in the value of water company stock which has been per cent <e> <s> in one or two cases <e> <s> does he appreciate that even if there is greater competitiveness under the proposed new system it will still not make up the expected return for those investing at such a high price <e> <s> consequently will he look again at the statutory model for water companies under which dividends and assets are controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for raising this subject at such an opportune time <e> <s> we expect legislation on the subject of water soon to be before us <e> <s> i listened with great interest as i am sure did everyone to what the noble lord said about the possibilities of competition in the water industry <e> <s> i think we were all particularly interested in his suggestion on cost competition <e> <s> we realise that he has enormous industrial experience particularly in the sphere of the coal industry <e> <s> i am sure we shall study further what he said on cost competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest to the noble lord lord dormand who shares with me a great interest in the north-east of england from which we both come that the interim period for which he asks for northern shipbuilders is something that we have had <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that to the best of my knowledge there is considerable appreciation in the region that everything possible has been done by all concerned including the government to keep these yards open if humanly possible <e> <s> it has been found impossible to do so <e> <s> i believe that the decision now made is the right one and in the best interests of the people of that town <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the northern region in november the unemployment rate was per cent <e> <s> although that is still too high it is the lowest figure for years <e> <s> will my noble friend continue to encourage those policies which have brought about this highly desirable trend <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself as an englishman taking part once again in a debate about the possibility of some form of devolved government for scotland <e> <s> i find that on four previous occasions in your lordships house a year ago and on three previous occasions in another place i have taken part in such a debate as this <e> <s> i have done so for a very distinct reason <e> <s> i live just miles south of the scottish border <e> <s> for quite a long time i represented a constituency in another place in the area known as the north east of england <e> <s> over a very long period of time i was consequently rightly involved in the enormous problems which the north east of england knew and to some degree still knows <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baoness lady fisher for giving the information about the manufacture of the garments of the sexes <e> <s> the debate has been going on for a long time and each speech has produced information of differing kinds <e> <s> as is customary i declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of a water company and a vice-president of the water companies association <e> <s> i was president of that association for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising for the fact that an evening engagement in newcastle upon tyne means that i cannot stay for the full debate <e> <s> i apologise most sincerely for that <e> <s> i should like very much to congratulate my noble friend lord butterworth on his presentation of the report <e> <s> i thought it masterly and comprehensive <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend on his chairmanship masterly and courteous at all times of the sub-committee during its long deliberations <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to take part in this debate <e> <s> i am open to correction but i rather feel that i might be the only member of your lordships house actively engaged at this time in the water industry <e> <s> i am chairman of a statutory company and as such of course i declare an interest <e> <s> in addition to that i had the very great honour to be president of the water companies association for no less than years so i have listened to the <e>", "<cs> simply the performance which the statutory companies have always sought to give <e> <s> the statutory water companies have always asked that they be compared with other statutory water companies not so much with the regional water authorities because that would be somewhat unfair as there is a difference <e> <s> we have always asked to be judged on our efficiency on our prices and on the way in which we have served the customer <e> <s> i believe that that comparison must continue after the bill is enacted and that the comparison can be made but can be made fairly only if all companies are included <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that full response <e> <s> i am sure he is not surprised that i find it very disappointing <e> <s> i believe that a good part of his argument on comparison is in fact in support of the amendments <e> <s> i point out to him once again that the government inquiry into the efficiency of all statutory companies has shown that some of the smaller companies are very efficient indeed <e> <s> i know from my own observations in associating with them that a number of small companies are not all that small <e> <s> they are just under million in some cases <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking in this second reading debate i should like to assure the noble lord lord dormand that i fully support the rationale of the bill <e> <s> i appreciate that it is designed further to advance the well-being of teesside <e> <s> in opening his speech he spoke of the problems which the area has known <e> <s> the noble lord and i have been associated with those problems in another place over a considerable period of time and in our various ways we have done our best to assist the regeneration of teesside <e> <s> a great deal has been achieved <e> <s> therefore i recognise that the promoters of the bill wish further to advance the well-being of teesside and all its people <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for his comments <e> <s> i repeat what i have said at various stages of the bill starting with the second reading debate through several amendments <e> <s> i hope that anything in the shape of write-off or dowry will apply to per cent <e> <s> of consumers and not just per cent <e>", "<cs> in responding to my noble friend i must say that i take on board what he said about balance and about there possibly being a need for further consideration <e> <s> i should hope that before the bill becomes an act on the statute book further consideration will be given to this point <e> <s> something must be done about the outdated basis on which the companies have to work in this regard <e> <s> i hope that the government will give further consideration at report stage to the problem which the companies face <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his response although somewhat disappointed <e> <s> i am grateful for his assurance that he will give further consideration to these important points <e> <s> in consequence i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again most grateful to my noble friend for his reception of this proposal <e> <s> i shall be more than happy to meet him in the interim <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend and the government for meeting as they have done through this group of amendments the very real concerns of the water companies which i expressed on report through my amendments <e> <s> the water companies association is most grateful for this meeting of their concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the september figure for unemployment in the northern region showed yet a further very satisfactory fall <e> <s> is he further aware that in the past six years unemployment in the northern region has halved <e> <s> does he agree that this suggests that regional policy is working rather well <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that years ago a select committee in another place of which i had the privilege to be chairman looked into intensive methods of food production and concluded that the sow stall house was without any question cruelly intensive <e> <s> will she at her absolute convenience look at the subsequent report of that committee with a view to implementing some of its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as chairman of a statutory water company the newcastle and gateshead water company i am more than fully conscious of the long and arduous discussions that have taken place between the water companies and the government on price increases <e> <s> does he accept that company chairmen like myself appreciate to the full that every criterion had to be justified before a price increase was granted <e> <s> in my opinon the very last thing that this government could ever be accused of is not supporting the well being of the water consumers of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill wholeheartedly <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend on introducing it <e> <s> i also commend all he has said in doing so <e> <s> he spoke a great deal about the dangers for young people of modern so-called acid-house parties and similar gatherings <e> <s> he also spoke a good deal about public entertainment licensing and the legal framework which exists under that heading <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his moving of the amendment <e> <s> in doing so i too declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of a cable company <e>"]
