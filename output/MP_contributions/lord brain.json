["<cs> my lords first i apologise for not putting my name to the list of speakers until the middle of this afternoon because i was not aware that i should be able to be present <e> <s> i should like to join in congratulating the noble lord lord russell of liverpool on his maiden speech <e> <s> having only recently taken that step myself i remember how it feels <e> <s> i felt that the noble lords sincerity and the great fluency with which he delivered his speech showed a great confidence of thought and this gives the house great confidence in the noble lords future contributions to our debates <e> <s> i would like to thank the noble viscount lord rochdale for introducing this topic and pick up two or three small points purely on the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not wishing to criticise the noble baronesss figures i was rather trying to re-emphasise that even more second-class degree people should be encouraged to go into industry <e> <s> i beg the noble baronesss pardon <e> <s> i also fear perhaps that many of the people who go into industry do not go sufficiently as they should into the manufacturing side of industry but get diverted into other tasks but that is in passing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also concern from the aspect of medical photographers and people such as that who have to prepare this <e> <s> as at present drafted the bill makes it quite clear that particular recordings are made for a certain purpose and are therefore exempt <e> <s> they can be handled in a certain way they can be catalogued and properly managed <e> <s> but it also means that any tape can be used in an appropriate purpose without the time-consuming bother of editing it for a particular use <e> <s> it means that a lecturer can use sections of a tape as he wishes during his demonstration and if there is a question coming along he can continue to tape something <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his reception of my amendment <e> <s> i mildly cross swords with him as to whether or not a hologram is a photographic item <e> <s> i certainly agree that there is no reason why it should not be added to the definition of a photograph even though in its original form as a hologram it has nothing visible on it until it is illuminated <e> <s> then the illuminated thing is an intangible image <e> <s> i am sure the minister will enjoy trying to sort that one out <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think also we have missed the point that certain images and i must accept that term are perfectly still and the camera moves <e> <s> there is no movement in the picture <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the amendment and i think it is right that the person who exposes the negative should have prior rights to the use of that negative <e> <s> however the words which have just been used by the noble lord lord kilbracken lead to some difficulties <e> <s> he used the words exposes the emulsion <e> <s> when i print from a negative onto a print i am exposing an emulsion <e> <s> the idea that the person who takes the photograph should have rights to the use of that negative is very important <e> <s> however i wonder whether the wording which the noble lord has used is the right answer <e> <s> there are many occasions when photographers create pictures from negatives in the way they print them <e> <s> that may cause further confusion <e> <s> i support the idea behind the amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that the means of getting there are right <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however <e> <s> i still think that we may end up by having to define the word photographer <e>", "<cs> we have had a slight tendency all through this debate to get stuck a little on journalists and publishing because of the use of the word author which has a traditional meaning <e> <s> an author can design a computer program for a small firm <e> <s> at the start it may be a computer-aided design program and it may lead nowhere but he may have the flair that the noble lord lord lloyd indicated in the design side on engineering and patents <e> <s> the balance here between a patentable thing and a copyright thing is getting close in the inventiveness of computer programs <e>", "<cs> we are back again to authors only writing <e> <s> they take photographs <e> <s> they may be part-time photographers who are on a minimal salary or wage <e> <s> i quite agree that my amendment was a bad one but it was an effort to reach a compromise <e> <s> i support this amendment and if this one fails i would certainly support one which gives copyright direct to the employee <e> <s> this amendment is much simpler and the employee needs to start with rights on his side <e> <s> i quite agree that subsequently by contact they will be eroded and knowing publishers in the literary sense they will be eroded very vigorously <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy for the idea behind this amendment in that if i as an individual commission a photograph of myself i wish to have at least some control over the copyright <e> <s> but i understand in relation to photographs that in the past young photographers have commissioned photographs of individuals and others for the purpose of building up a library <e> <s> they may then become eminent photo-portrait artists and things like that and they have lost control at an early stage in their career of what could be a significant archive for their future benefit <e> <s> this needs looking at and this is why i have certain reservations about this amendment as a whole although thinking that the principle behind at least part of it is valuable and significant <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but before i do so i would point out to the noble lord in front of me that artistic work as defined in clause specifically means <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his comments <e> <s> having probed i think that i have established the difference between a tourist as exemplified by the noble and learned lord opposite whom i wanted to protect and the commercial aspects which i believe are to be looked at again and the deliberate intention to copy <e> <s> on that basis and thanking everybody who has taken part i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i help in this discussion <e> <s> let us suppose that somebody is just warehousing on behalf of somebody else and you cannot then trace the other people <e> <s> you can at least have the man who has them in the course of his trade or business <e> <s> he is not using them or doing anything to them <e> <s> he may not even know what is in them but they are on his premises in the course of his trade or business <e>", "<cs> i think that the commercial aspect of abstracting is one that perhaps fairly needs control <e> <s> however photographic abstracting which has been carried out for many years and is regarded internationally as the sole source of photographic information from international resources and <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give the committee another brief example of this situation <e> <s> suppose that someone has on file a photograph for which he has quite justifiably paid a reproduction fee on a previous occasion <e> <s> suppose further that an event takes place and that the photograph is then taken out of the file with the argument that it illustrates a current event <e> <s> there will be no need to pay and that will be fair game <e> <s> i do not think that that is fair dealing <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may once again use very briefly the magic word of the opposition front bench collage <e> <s> a large collage can contain the whole of a photograph <e> <s> it may be incidental in some of the legal definitions of incidental <e> <s> however it is very important that the photograph should not be taken out of copyright purely because incidental to the collage is the whole of the copyright photograph <e>", "<cs> the copyright relates to people being taught to copy artistic works <e> <s> if it is a painting or something of that nature there is no problem because it can never be the same <e> <s> however where someone is being taught to copy photographs the resultant copy of the original photograph will be identical <e> <s> it will not be identified as a copyright item <e> <s> if it is a particularly valuable photograph it may go on to the market for the benefit of the teacher or the student at a considerable price <e> <s> that is something which needs to he looked at and borne in mind <e> <s> i have a concern about it but i go no further than that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assist the minister from memory <e> <s> he said that the problem was that three consecutive months was very difficult to monitor whereas four distinct periods of three months were much easier to monitor <e> <s> that was his reason <e> <s> i have no doubt that by now he may have sorted his way through his paperwork <e> <s> i think that a message has arrived <e> <s> however i believe that that was the correct reason <e>", "<cs> i think that what the minister has just said is quite true that the assertion can be continued in the electronic transmission <e> <s> very often in the filing system the two then have a great risk of getting separated <e> <s> all that this amendment seeks to do and all that we are seeking to do is to ensure that the information is retained on the copy <e> <s> as i said at an earlier stage with future magnetic means of taking photographs it may not even have been on the <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i happen to know that the government have to produce further amendments to schedule which are a consequence of something that has already been discussed in this committee stage <e> <s> therefore i do not think that one can ask them for that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall make a further point about that in a moment if we are going to discuss that amendment or perhaps after he has replied <e>", "<cs> my lords the dictionary also mentions photochromic methods of producing holograms and other things <e> <s> photochromic is covered by the governments definition of photography which might not have been as it was originally described <e> <s> the governments definition of photography covers holograms and any other form of three dimensional device-making by lasers and things like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i said i should like to listen to what the noble lord lord beaverbrook had to say about this amendment when it was being discussed earlier <e> <s> i have a brief point to make <e> <s> as he well knows i am concerned with the words or a reprographic copy <e> <s> many photographers would regard an enlarger under the definition of reprographic copying process as a reprographic copying device <e> <s> this is a genuine concern and will cause confusion in the minds of photographers seeking to protect their works <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to consider removing those words by the next stage and amending the definition of reprographic copying to the extent that such copying does not result in the creation of a photograph <e>", "<cs> my lords i support these amendments <e> <s> i do so for exactly the reasons which have been expressed by the last speaker whom i consider was wrong <e> <s> as i understand it <e> <s> local photographers very often indeed normally on small newspapers photograph the scene outside the church for the paper and are then allowed to take other photographs at the reception entirely for their own use and with their own copyright <e> <s> this amendment and in particular the government amendment will remove something that already exists and will cost the newspapers more because they will then have to reach an agreement with their employee for all the rights that he is forgoing and matters of that kind <e> <s> i should not be in the least surprised if the journalists object very strongly to the change in the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i do not totally follow the line of reasoning of the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> if purely a private individual is commissioning a private photograph i quite accept that that should be the property of the person who makes the commission <e> <s> i am less happy about a situation where an up-and-coming portrait photographer or as i believe happens a portrait artist is commissioned by a gallery or an archive organisation a photographic library to take photographs for the library or for future sales from that gallery <e> <s> i am unhappy about any subsequent lack of control over the use of those photographs <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment because it is already practical for a photographer using magnetic media which is now defined as a photograph to take a photograph in japan say for it to be transmitted by fax arrangements to london for it to be put up on a vdu for editing and it is seen for the first time in hard copy in print in a newspaper or something similar <e> <s> this deserves to be the sort of copying which is protected <e> <s> i like the method of protecting it proposed by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the noble lord has shot himself in the foot <e> <s> he has just gained the opportunity of copying right across the board and he then says that we cannot copy efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords i warned the minister that i too do not like the clause not so much from the point of view of the auctioneers and such people but from the point of view of organisers of exhibitions <e> <s> for example the royal photographic society organises an annual exhibition where people exhibit voluntarily without any reservations of copyright and if the society were to use the best pictures out of the exhibition without any consent either all our future entries would dry up or there would be a tremendous stir <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this very confusing because we have here a large group of amendments which in themselves may he fine when one is considering them in relation to authorship and writing <e> <s> we have a much wider scope than this namely artistic works and subjects like that <e> <s> i wish that the government had been a little more selective in the grouping of the amendments which would have made it easier for us to discuss them <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister replied he said that i was wrong to say that modification was not covered <e> <s> he will find that under clause a photographers will have a right <e> <s> it is being given or excluded by this amendment according to the way that one looks at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government for what is probably a very good compromise on this question of copyright ownership by the commissioner of a photograph <e> <s> it gives the photographer the right to receive a financial benefit from owning the copyright but allows the person who commissioned the photograph the control over its other reproduction <e> <s> i think that the balance is right and thank the government for this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the government for the very hard work that i know they have done <e> <s> i believe that this definition is now right and i hope that it will be agreeable to your lordships <e> <s> i have left in an amendment about reprographic copying and photographs but in view of what the minister has said it is obvious that i shall not need to move it <e> <s> i thank the noble lord and other members of the house who have co-operated in putting forward my arguments on this amendment that have not been as concise as they might <e>", "<cs> i have two fairly small points and i wish to follow up points made from the bench in front of me <e> <s> in his introductory speech the noble lord lord tordoff said in relation to amendment no <e> <s> that a person shall receive a copy when given the opportunity of access <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> does not in any way refer to receiving a copy and i believe that this again returns to the point of defining what access means and that it may mean receiving a copy rather than having to go to the surgery to see what is written <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> he may solve the problem if in amendment no <e> <s> which states <e>", "<cs> can the detailed information on this subject be put into the library <e> <s> those of us who have received briefings on the subject understand that a pump-action weapon is no faster than an efficiently <e>", "<cs> i said a little earlier that i felt that the noble earl was putting up a smokescreen and was not giving us specific answers to specific questions <e> <s> for example he has totally ignored my comments about the definition of pistols and self-loading rifles in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he has not done me the courtesy of saying a single word about it <e> <s> i am surprised <e>", "<cs> yet again i do not believe that the government have answered the point <e> <s> i have a catalogue showing sporting guns which are normally available the length of which is right on the margin of the inch length which the government propose <e> <s> do not believe that it is an answer to say that the government have done their homework and inches is the right length <e> <s> i believe that there is a need for greater statistics <e> <s> perhaps the government would <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while there may be a few i understand that there is also a significant number of specially made long-barrelled weapons in this category <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much <e> <s> i thought that that was the case but i felt it necessary to probe for certainty <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am finding it difficult to follow which amendment we are on <e> <s> i believed that we were on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have a suspicion that the noble lord lord swansea is speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i believe that the last speaker is very optimistic because as i understand it the shotgun <e>", "<cs> the noble lady has already said that many years ago new zealand abandoned a register of shotguns <e> <s> i understand that in australia the state of victoria has had a three-year trial of registering shotguns <e> <s> it is in the fourth year abandoning the trial as a waste of police time and a total source of non-information <e>", "<cs> it is open to misinterpretation because the certificate could read this certificate is valid for six guns and describe only four <e> <s> i believe that that six might then be said to be the maximum <e> <s> if someone wished to add three more guns to the certificate the chief constable would say sorry the specified number is six <e> <s> i believe it is open to misinterpretation and i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i disagree with the minister because i think that the police will themselves start issuing forms fairly quickly <e> <s> they will vary for each part of the country and people will get into a muddle and waste much police time trying to punch things into a computer <e> <s> if the information is on a form one will simply punch it into a computer in the correct order <e> <s> one will not have to chase <e>", "<cs> i do not quite follow the argument of the noble earl <e> <s> the provision states produces a certificate <e> <s> it does not say produces a valid certificate <e> <s> his argument that one would not know whether or not the certificate was valid seems to be just as applicable to his own wording as to mine <e> <s> i had naturally anticipated that because the certificate had been produced all the details including its duration and validity would have been noted down <e> <s> that was the purpose of having produced it <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has answered the point <e> <s> i was suggesting that the provision should refer to has produced a certificate authorising him to do something <e> <s> it presumably authorises him to do it at this time and not with an expired certificate <e> <s> nevertheless at this time of the night i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has put certain caveats in his reply and i shall read it again in <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is a fair remark <e> <s> the principle that the minister expounded previously was once a section weapon always a section <e>", "<cs> in some ways the noble earl has supported my argument <e> <s> he said that one is permitted to turn a firearm into a shotgun <e> <s> to the noble lord lord swansea the noble earl now says that a section weapon may not be turned into a section firearm <e>", "<cs> i take that point but one can envisage where a section weapon is dismantled and the barrel which is perfectly usable is refitted to something else <e> <s> it is a pity that a good barrel cannot be fitted to a new mechanism <e> <s> i accept that the noble earl has nothing more to say and i leave it at that <e> <s> i merely say that it is a pity <e>", "<cs> i am still disappointed because i very much doubt whether represents the extra work <e> <s> it is supplying one form instead of two or i suspect that we shall get one joint certificate fairly quickly which will cover both operations on one piece of paper <e> <s> i am disappointed with the ministers reply but hardly surprised <e> <s> i should have thought that it could have been covered in the firearms certificate or that it could have been perfectly nominal <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to get involved with the first two amendments namely amendments nos <e> <s> and because i do not think that i am competent to comment upon them <e> <s> i should not be very happy with amendment no <e> <s> and my views will come out as i explain my reasons for tabling amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should perhaps comment on the remarks made by the noble lord lord ironside because i have a feeling that the essential part which is being deleted in amendment no <e> <s> would cover just what he has been talking about <e> <s> a firearms licence would be an essential part in the research and <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may pick up one small point which the noble earl has made <e> <s> where is the boundary for beginners between target practice and competition <e> <s> there may be small internal competitions <e> <s> will those he excluded <e> <s> i wholeheartedly agree with the noble earl that if beginners go to other rifle clubs for competition purposes they should be covered <e> <s> even then there are sometimes side-by-side competitions between junior members of rifle clubs who do not own rifles <e> <s> they may go to another club and take part in friendly target practice <e> <s> however it is also competitive <e> <s> it is a small point and the noble earl may not wish to answer immediately <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the reasons for not speaking to the other amendments will become clear as i go along <e> <s> however i am quite happy that they should be considered with this amendment and i shall continue the discussion in that way <e> <s> i beg the committees pardon <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> the point is that he is duly authorised by a chief officer of police <e> <s> how many will be authorised <e> <s> will it just be those officers in the firearms section <e> <s> can a vast number be authorised <e> <s> for example can any officer and i use the word advisedly because i do not want to cause any confusion who is going out in a patrol car for a purpose in the area be duly authorised <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very broad term in this context <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> i am satisfied that the authority and other matters will cover it <e> <s> as the minister says the local firearms unit must build up confidence and ensure that it will not do anything unnecessarily harassing but will exercise fairness in its operation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether there is not just a small anomaly here <e> <s> the gun that the visitor has in his possession may by some manner be a brand new gun <e> <s> i shall not necessarily go into the details of this because the gun may he loaned to an estate and therefore be an estate gun and be perfectly legal <e> <s> the visitor during his residence here uses it legally under a firearms permit <e> <s> at the end of his stay he says i <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps if we all read <e>", "<cs> is there not likely to be yet again a way round that in that everybody will automatically apply for permission to shoot on all land over which they have the owners permission <e> <s> in that case the bill itself will become a nonsense <e> <s> i think that we are taking the risk however small of legislating a piece of nonsense <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with self-loading rifles <e> <s> i believe that pump-action rifles were not mentioned <e> <s> however i have no wish to detain the committee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the good news from the noble earl i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late and i shall be as brief as i can because i do not want to give an overdose of the medicine we have already received <e> <s> the noble lords lord trafford and lord pitt of hampstead have made many of the points i have in my notes and i shall not repeat them <e> <s> i would just emphasise the question of experience through my <e>", "<cs> my lords as the evening is progressing i too shall attempt to cut short my speech <e> <s> i shall follow a number of the points made by the noble lord lord flowers and the noble lord lord dainton and deal principally with the aspects of the white paper relating to junior hospital doctors and some of the problems which may arise <e>", "<cs> we have been going round in circles <e> <s> maximum power is measured in kilowatts <e> <s> it is universally known and can be understood by the technicians <e> <s> but if one says to the customer your supply is for one washing machine one cooker three hair dryers two toasters an electric kettle and a tumble dryer and then he changes the mix who is to know whether they are one kilowatt or watt units <e> <s> the result will be nonsense <e> <s> if one changes ones mix of domestic applicances the supplier will have no idea whether you are within the limit <e> <s> fifty kilowatts is a figure that he knows and everybody else knows <e> <s> that can be converted into the various appliances by using a checklist which is sent out with the demand form <e> <s> i have given this information in the past when moving into an older house because i needed to get the kilowattage right <e> <s> i was helped <e>", "<cs> it is not the cost of electricity that we are talking about it is the cost of distributing the electricity and the cost of the wires <e> <s> i support the noble lord in this amendment in that rural areas are much more costly as regards distributing electricity <e> <s> are we to have a different price for houses that are situated a mile away from a town as compared with a house that is situated miles away <e> <s> will the legislation go into that detail <e> <s> are we to end up with british telecom charging people on different exchanges different prices for their phone calls because their respective wires are different distances away from the exchange <e>", "<cs> i believe that this is perhaps unnecessary because publicity is not adequate if it is not understood <e> <s> i suspect that one is adding words unnecessarily <e> <s> i take the point that was mentioned from the front bench about the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also most concerned about the amendment <e> <s> i think in particular the wording is a little difficult <e> <s> it includes the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank my noble friend lord hunter of newington for asking this question and for his excellent historic introduction to the development of the national health service that we have today <e>", "<cs> is this not too restrictive <e> <s> i understand that the process carried out in in vitro fertilisation requires the implantation of more than one embryo <e> <s> if this amendment is carried only one embryo may be implanted because a specified woman cannot be given more than one child <e> <s> i suspect that the wording is defective <e>", "<cs> there is one small point which was brought up <e> <s> with some of the diseases that are sex-linked there is a definite need <e> <s> i quite agree about blue eyes and such characteristics but regarding whether a male or female embryo will be replaced in a woman that is one of the suitable conditions that might be excluded <e> <s> one would not be able to select that if the noble dukes amendment were passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton and the noble lord lord middleton for their very comprehensive introductions to these two reports <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will understand that because it is late in the afternoon and also because i am not an expert in many of the matters covered by the reports i shall concentrate on only two points <e>"]
