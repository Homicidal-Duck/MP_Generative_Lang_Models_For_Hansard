["<cs> my lords i do not intend to detain your lordships at this late hour for any great length of time but i want to touch on two aspects of the subject which has been raised by the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh and the house is grateful to him for having raised it <e> <s> the first is purely the defence aspect and the second is the social aspect of defence in this country today <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the projected murder of the bbc symphony orchestra in scotland may i ask the minister whether he realises that this has outraged the entire musical world <e> <s> in view of the volume of protests not only from scotland but from many other countries may i ask the noble lord to consider whether the government might make a formal request to the bbc not to do this because this act of vandalism and it is no less is not only unprecedented but uncharacteristic of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he realises that the violent fluctuations in the price of gold of which he complains would not take place if we went back to the gold standard <e>"]
