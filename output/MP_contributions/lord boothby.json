the same in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my only excuse for addressing your lordships this afternoon is that for the last years and particularly for the last of them i have been right about gold when

is no money he should talk about paper supply <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who sat in another place for years unbroken years and as a result contributed regularly to their pension fund but who has no pension at all may i ask the noble earl whether he is aware that the interminable delay of the boyle committee in making any recommendation about pre- members of parliament despite strong pressure over the years from both houses of parliament has meant that a good many of the people concerned have had to live and some of them to die in considerable poverty <e> <s> it really is time that something was done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer may i ask the noble lord whether he

projected murder of the bbc symphony orchestra in scotland may i ask the minister whether he realises that this has outraged the entire musical world <e> <s> in view of the volume of protests not only from scotland but from many other countries may i ask the noble lord to consider whether the government might make a formal request to the bbc not to do this because this act of vandalism and it is no

action on the part of her majestys government if a serious crisis for what is left of our fishing industry is to be averted <e> <s> secondly can we take it from the noble earls slightly vague reply that her majestys government have no intention of selling the british inshore fishing industry to the eec in exchange for a budget settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that the question of gold was not mentioned at the summit conference may i suggest to my noble friend that he might consider whether it should be put on the agenda for the next summit conference because as a commodity it is just as important as oil and after the next presidential election may assume even greater importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have missed it but may i ask the noble lord whether her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one very brief question to the noble and learned lord which is simply whether her majestys government realise as i think they do that the jews alone the

walston this afternoon <e> <s> i thought <e>", "<cs> my lords may ask the noble lord whether he will bear in mind that mr macmillan became prime minister and kept the tory party in power for six years

political and economic in continuing the policy of stopping all housing construction at a time of cruel shortage of houses and that this should not be regarded as a permanent policy but as a temporary

scotland for centuries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much doubt it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the minister to ask whether he realises that the old system of town councillors and provosts had a dignity and carried a certain status which these committees do not have <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether we can take it from his reply that her majestys government realise that the closure of any one of these lines would do irreparable damage to the economy of scotland as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish only to say that i had the privilege of opening the new fish market in peterhead harbour years ago with the understandable result that it has since become the most prosperous fishing harbour in scotland <e> <s> i therefore warmly welcome the bill <e>",

which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that splendid <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one final question of the noble lord which is simply this does he realise that the whole world has never yet been able to get on without some kind of international monetary system until today when it is not getting on at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that at the moment the whole fishing industry of this country is a stricken industry <e> <s> can he give us any assurance that on friday her majestys government will stand absolutely firm on the basic essentials for its survival which include the -mile limit in its entirety and certain special areas in the irish sea and in the minch <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will

deplorable <e> <s> i should like to make one suggestion <e> <s> shortly after the first world war the then head of mi who was a friend of mine said if you want to know how the secret service works you

really unnecessary that the government will request the commission of inquiry to examine how they have done it in the united states because there is no doubt at all that racial relations in the united

noble lord lord ohagan for raising this vital topic <e> <s> this is a difficult speech for me to make because it is sad and i hate being sad <e> <s> but i think it is essential at this moment to look back and see how and why the eec in its present form came into existence <e> <s> i have been in this business for a long time <e> <s> i was at the san francisco conference as a newspaper correspondent

lord sits down is not this a case of buying yourself to freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer may i ask the noble lord whether he realises that there is a certain section of opinion in the city of london which thinks that some legislation might be necessary in order to enforce the

<e> <s> does he realise that at the moment italy is the main target of the communist radio and that the dangers arising from that are very considerable for all of us and does he not think it

my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble and learned lords pardon for interrupting his putting of the question and i certainly do not wish to dispute his authority

<e> <s> otherwise my lords i would never have dared to do so <e> <s> i do so on this occasion only because i want to say that although there are very few advantages in living to the age of one of them

lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer may i ask one or two very brief supplementary questions of the minister

security of this country has always depended on sea power and always will <e> <s> is he aware that it was the loss of sea power that brought us nearest to defeat in two world wars <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a widespread impression has been given to the public that the disparity between the increases now offered to the nurses and those to high civil servants members of parliament admirals generals and so on is too great and will the government take some steps either to correct this impression or to explain it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord whether he will bear in mind that we are not fighting a colonial war to capture an island in the south atlantic <e> <s> we are fighting for freedom and democracy and freedom includes freedom of speech <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord also bear in mind that if parliament were to attempt to make the latter treasonable we should be embarking upon a course of great danger and one which might betray our cause <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for the statement may i ask one question directed towards the economic front <e> <s> the world is still suffering despite fluctuations from time to time from the scourge of inflation and we have no viable international monetary system <e> <s> so long as that continues it will be impossible in the long run to stop world inflation continuing <e> <s> the only way out is to give money as such some value so long as it remains worthless the problem will remain insoluble and my complaint is that the summit conference did nothing to resolve that problem <e> <s> the easiest way out would be for the united states to lead us all back to a gold exchange standard with flexible exchange rates and a price for bullion fixed from time to time in accordance with reality by the imf though there are other possibilities of giving value to money <e> <s> can the leader of the house say whether the governments concerned will give further consideration to this vital problem <e> <s> so long as the international monetary system remains in a state of chaos we cannot really bring inflation under control <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble baroness one very brief question <e> <s> while we all hope for an amicable solution to the problem can she give us an assurance at least that so long as spain keeps the frontier with gibraltar closed the accession of spain to the common market will not be acceptable to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether her majestys government will bear in mind that the danes have already ruined the herring fishing industry by ruthless over-fishing of immature fish for industrial purposes and that the objective of the continental countries of western europe for the past years has been to fish up to our beaches with heavy trawlers and thus destroy our inshore fishing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that very unsatisfactory answer may i ask the noble lord whether her majestys government realise that the present world economic recession stems from the decision of the united states government when the bretton woods agreement collapsed as i predicted it would and the rejection of which i moved in another place to demonetize the dollar which halved the french gold reserves wiped out million dollars of our own reserves and reduced the stock of international reserves from million dollars to million dollars <e> <s> may i further ask whether they are aware that the only world statesman who foresaw this and who consistently advocated a viable international monetary policy based on a gold exchange standard was president de gaulle <e> <s> finally for how long do her majestys government mean to tag along as their predecessors have done for the last years both labour and tory in the wake of the economic policies of the united states treasury and the federal reserve board which border on insanity and which have already brought deep recession and unemployment to the united states and which are now doing the same to western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me to ask him one final very brief question <e> <s> it is simply this <e> <s> the world can never get out of the recession in which it now is without a viable international monetary system of some kind <e> <s> how <e>", "<cs> my lords with what we have not got <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord

and gallant lord agree that it was lack of adequate sea power that brought us nearly to defeat in two world wars <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer may i ask the noble lord two short and friendly questions <e> <s> the first is that as we are now the only major power which has had practical experience of modern missiles will we learn the lessons and they must be many to be drawn <e> <s> there is no doubt that if so many missiles had not failed to explode our casualties would have been far greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already addressed your lordships too often on this subject but as the man who was primarily responsible for getting the wolfenden committee established by persuading the then home secretary sir david maxwell fyfe to do it and who also introduced a bill to your lordships house to extend wolfenden to scotland which was passed by a large majority when i first introduced it to your lordships and by an overwhelming majority of the house of commons when it was reintroduced there in the form of an amendment to another bill by a labour member <e> <s> i must say that so long as we still govern northern ireland it is quite monstrous that we should not extend the provisions of wolfenden to the people of northern ireland <e> <s> we do still govern northern ireland <e> <s> the noble earl the minister has made it perfectly plain here today that for the time being as a result of the elections in northern ireland any question of complete devolution was ruled out that we were responsible for governing northern ireland indefinitely and that so long as that position is maintained if they ever get a government of their own and wish to reverse it they are welcome to do so it would he quite monstrous to exclude ulster from wolfenden <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who for over thirty years has been in the forefront of this battle to save the inshore fishing industry from destruction i must confess to the noble earl that i never thought that i would live to see this day <e> <s> i am quite satisfied that it is really a day of triumph and i do wish to congratulate not only the noble earl the present minister but also successive ministers for agriculture fisheries and food and secretaries of state for scotland two of whom we have had intervening this afternoon on the long patience courage and resilience which they have shown in achieving what i believe to be the best possible result we could have obtained and the best fisheries agreement we have ever had <e>", "<cs> while thanking the noble earl for his reply may i ask him to bear in mind that british sea power was built up on our fishing industry in the reign of henry viii and has been sustained by it ever since <e> <s> as one who has fought for the fishing industry in both houses of parliament for over half a century may i also thank her majestys government

house of parliament for just on years my chief interest apart from foreign affairs has always been the fishing industry and i have seen both through some very bad times <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question arising from what he has been saying <e> <s> does he not agree that now we are on friendly terms with the danes we should suggest to them that they should seriously consider going easy on the catching of immature stocks with small fishing vessels which they are doing all over the place and which i myself am convinced is the main cause of the decline of the herring fishing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord how if her majestys government wish to increase the size of the local militia in the falklands they propose to set about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from that answer may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that for a century prior to during which period the french revolution and the napoleonic wars took place there was no inflation and trade flowed freely across frontiers entirely due to the fact that gold was the basis of every major currency in europe <e> <s> do the government realise that the whole world is now suffering from a desperate shortage of liquid reserves and that gold bullion is one of those reserves and has been for over a thousand years <e> <s> are the government also aware that when the americans demonitised the dollar and with it rendered every currency in the world intrinsically valueless they plunged us all into a deep economic recession from which we have not yet recovered and do not look like doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the answer to the noble lord lord blyton that the misery of the s was caused simply because we went back to the gold standard at the wrong parity of exchange as was admitted by the then chancellor of the exchequer mr winston churchill <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak for only one reason <e> <s> i was talking last week to a group of noble lords who were kind enough to say that my worst enemy could never accuse me of being a bore <e> <s> then after a moments pause one of them said except on one subject <e> <s> to my dismay they then agreed unanimously that on the subject of monetary policy i was a crashing bore <e> <s> i had only one defender my noble friend lord shinwell <e> <s> all the rest said no it is no good <e> <s> whenever you get up to speak about monetary policy or gold we all go back to sleep <e> <s> i will tell your lordships why <e>

many of those speeches in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> and he agreed with many of them <e> <s> unfortunately the treasury and the bank of england did not agree with any of them <e> <s> but the fact remains that over all those years i was steadily right and the treasury and the bank of england were as steadily <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he and her majestys government will bear in mind in any forthcoming negotiations that if the gibraltar naval base and dockyard had not existed it would have been quite impossible to mount the expeditionary force to the falkland islands in time <e> <s> secondly will my noble friend bear in mind that if we now close the naval base and dockyard at gibraltar there will be no british naval presence of any kind in the mediterranean for the first time since the tudors reigned over this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who introduced the original national milk scheme which was passed without a division in another place at the height of the battle of britain <e> <s> i would only ask the minister whether he can give us an assurance that this bill will not involve any serious interruption in the supply of cheap milk for the children of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who has just spoken talked a bit at one time about trade unions and i should be very interested to know the answer to one question <e> <s> is he in favour of solidarity or is he in favour of suppressing it by means of martial law <e> <s> it would be interesting to know his views on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak very briefly on only one subject not foreign affairs because they have been well covered but defence because that is what the last election was really fought about <e> <s> the labour party asked the british people to lay down on their backs once again in this century and surrender to tyranny and the british people this time thank god said no not again <e> <s> we wont do it <e> <s> that is why the labour party suffered such an annihilating defeat <e> <s> the british people just rose and said we will not be betrayed <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to beg leave to ask the question standing in

given that we would not admit spain to the common market so long as she keeps up the blockade of gibraltar which she is now doing <e> <s> indeed that is doing great harm to the citizens of gibraltar <e> <s> i ask the noble lord and the government to bear in mind that the dockyard at gibraltar was absolutely essential to us in two world wars from start to finish and that without it we could not possibly have dispatched the expeditionary force to the falklands in time <e> <s> why choose this moment to harm the gibraltarians now happily british subjects and still further to weaken british naval power <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to make a debate out of this but i ask the noble lord to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount forgive me if i ask him just one question <e> <s> can he give us an assurance that the light forces of the royal navy will be better protected against modern missiles in the future than they clearly were during the falklands campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i revert to the rather more congenial subject of inshore fishing <e> <s> i should like to start my very brief remarks by saying what a privilege i regard it for those of us here to have been present and still better to have heard the maiden speech of the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> it was brilliant and more than that it was better than most of us expected which is saying a good deal <e> <s> it was a taste of the many delicious things which we all hope are to come <e> <s> we thank him and i thank him personally and deeply for the privilege of being present when he made his speech <e> <s> it was the most remarkable maiden speech that i have heard in this place or indeed in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether the government realise that the bumper crops of the opium poppy all over the far east but particularly in pakistan have made it increasingly difficult to control the import of drugs to the west and that the traffic has increased three-fold in the past three or four years particularly for example in the irish republic and in scotland where it is now reaching dangerous proportions <e> <s> may i further ask the noble lord whether her majestys government will strengthen the anti-drug forces in this country as well as making contributions abroad including customs controls <e> <s> will they restrict prescriptions for certain drugs under the nhs and within that to a limited number of doctors so that a sharp eye can be kept on the number of prescriptions <e> <s> in conclusion may i ask the noble lord whether he realises that the number of drug pushers in this country is really getting frightening <e> <s> i do not know what steps can be taken such as more police but the number of pushers is increasing <e> <s> a new lot have landed just close to where i live and i sometimes go down to look at them not to purchase but to watch their activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships long <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble viscount the leader of the house whether we should not bear in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that courteous but rather uninformative reply may i ask him whether her majestys government realise that in the modern world scotch whisky is about the only thing left that brings guaranteed and sustained comfort to mankind and is also a much better medicine than the deluge of drugs which pour upon us every day <e> <s> in these circumstances may i ask the noble lord what is the purpose of pursuing a policy which by means of penal taxation on a particular commodity deprives of this comfort all except the comparatively well-to-do and simultaneously reduces the revenue to the exchequer damages our export trade and constitutes a serious threat to the economy of scotland where many distilleries are facing the possibility of closure <e>", "<cs> too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that i am expressing the view of all of us who sit on the cross-benches when i say how much i agree with everything that has been said in the house this afternoon in particular the hope which has been expressed that the lesson will at last have been learned in the united states of america <e> <s> secondly may i associate myself with the moving and perhaps overdue tribute paid by the noble lord lord mishcon to the police to whom we owe so much and to whom we shall always owe so much <e>", "<cs> i had my doubts but the noble lord lord gray has convinced me that this amendment is necessary <e>", "<cs> before we end this committee stage i should just like to say to the noble lord that i think that at the end of the day whatever slips the draftsmen may have made we have a jolly good bill which can do nothing but good to the inshore fishing industry for which i have fought for years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether her majestys government realise that the best chance of obtaining a real reduction of armaments by international agreement will come when the burden of expenditure on defence becomes unendurable and that this will happen to the soviet union sooner than it happens to the united states or to the countries of western europe <e> <s> meanwhile does the noble baroness realise that the best hope of avoiding a third world war is the achievement and maintenance of parity between nato and the soviet union both in nuclear and in conventional weapons which are interdependent <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of his answer may i ask the noble lord whether he realises that in two world wars what brought this country nearest to defeat was loss of sea power and that sea power has never been so drastically reduced by any government in british history as it has been by the present government during the past three years <e> <s> we have withdrawn the british naval presence from the persian gulf aden and from the mediterranean with the exception of a toe-hold in gibraltar now under sentence of death and today we are unable to fulfil our obligations to nato in home waters <e> <s> will the noble lord give us an assurance that her majestys government will stop attacking the royal navy and start rebuilding our sea power upon which we ultimately depend for our existence and survival <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the noble lord in view of his reply to my supplementary question whether he realises that the naval forces in this country which he says are far stronger than they have ever been were barely able to cope with the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that the fisheries agreements which have been negotiated with the countries of western europe are the best that we have ever had and that this is primarily due to the diplomatic skill with which they were negotiated in brussels by mr peter walker as minister of agriculture fisheries and food with staunch support from the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> at every stage the fishermen and their leaders were consulted and agreement was reached <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that his example might be followed by the government over the wider field of industry <e> <s> it proves that consensus when it can be arrived at pays off far better than confrontation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount bear in mind the wise words of the late field marshal montgomery when he told this house i heard him that we would never get effective co-operation in the field of defence or economics in western europe until the political association between the western european powers was defined <e> <s> it has never been defined and in view of the fact that the original council of europe of which i was a member and which might have done it was smashed by a british foreign secretary mr anthony eden does he not think that her majestys government should consider making a political initiative designed to achieve not fictitious but real union in western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that i think that the bill has been greatly improved by the amendments made in another place <e> <s> i always liked the bill but it has now been made even better <e> <s> i would just like to congratulate the government <e> <s> alas <e> <s> i cannot congratulate them on everything these days but there is one matter that they have handled superbly since the war and that is the inshore fishing industry especially the inshore fishing industry of scotland with which i have had something to do in the course of a long political career <e> <s> after the war that industry was facing disaster <e> <s> now it is one of the most prosperous industries in scotland and the government all governments but particularly this government and successive ministers of agriculture fisheries and food should bear considerable credit if only for persuading european governments of the need for conservation and they deserve it <e> <s> i am very satisfied with this bill <e> <s> i am very satisfied with the condition of the inshore fishing industry generally in scotland and i should like to take this opportunity of congratulating all concerned <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question in the interests of the whole committee would he now shut up <e>", "<cs> i want to say only a few words as a very old parliamentarian <e> <s> in view of the fact that her majestys government have told us that they have important new proposals to make as a result of the vote that was taken in this chamber last week and that we do not yet have any idea of what are those proposals nor apparently have they and i do not blame them for that they deserve careful consideration i submit to your lordships with all due respect that the whole of todays debate is a complete waste of time <e>", "<cs> if the government themselves as they have admitted do not know what we are talking about how the hell should we know <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house very much indeed for what he has said about me <e> <s> i should also like to take the opportunity to thank your lordships in all parts of the house for your kindness to me over the last years <e> <s> i must confess that i am quite pleased that i have sat in one house or the other for unbroken years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount in conclusion whether he realises that i tabled this question in order to find out whether her majestys government had learned the lesson of the s when some of us not very many told parliament what was happening in germany and what could and must be done to stop it <e> <s> neither the government nor the opposition paid any heed to our warnings and the result was the second world war <e> <s> now just half a century later i wanted to know whether the government are heeding similar warnings in a very similar situation and i am satisfied that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there is considerable anxiety among the fishing fleets not only of this country but of other european countries over the possible effect of a massive spanish invasion of our territorial waters which have been agreed by the council of ministers spain having the largest fishing fleet in the world <e> <s> can the noble viscount give an assurance that that will not be allowed to happen in any <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that what is causing anxiety in the british fishing industry is the sheer size of the spanish fishing fleet which is the largest in the world <e> <s> do her majestys government realise that some limit must be placed on the number of spanish vessels which can fish in northern european waters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to ask a brief question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a -second question <e> <s> does the noble lord not think in a century which has seen more people killed than any other that at the end of the day individuals in that century have a right to choose whether to stick it out a little longer or to call it a day <e> <s> surely that is reasonable considering that science can call it a day so quickly and painlessly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that the relentless march of modern technology is going to make differentiation between so-called conventional weapons and nuclear weapons almost impossible and finally quite impossible <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add just a few words to what the noble viscount lord eccles has said <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i only want to ask one question of the noble viscount and it arises out of his reference to the middle east <e> <s> can he give us an assurance in view of the agreement reached between the prime minister and the president that her majestys government will now join with the government of the united states in following up the initiative since taken by the prime minister of egypt <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord plowden and his excellent team on producing an extremely interesting and admirable report which we have all read with the greatest of interest <e> <s> i also have great pleasure and some relief in asking the government to accept my warmest congratulations on a signal economic triumph <e> <s> i have not done that for a very long time <e> <s> but their handling of the inshore fishing industrys problems cannot be faulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer is the noble lord aware that unless something really drastic is done by somebody to stop or to limit the parking of these juggernauts all over central london traffic will gradually grind to a standstill <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to ask one very short question <e> <s> i think that the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon came as a great shock to the whole house when he reminded us that for the last years successive governments have been given repeated and authoritative warnings about the dangers which beset football grounds throughout the country and that no government during those years paid any attention to them <e> <s> the noble lord has not sought to excuse nor to apologise <e> <s> it is a great reflection upon whitehall <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may offer my sincere congratulations to the minister of state and to the secretary of state for scotland on a most remarkable achievement <e> <s> they have obtained million from the present chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that in the end one cannot stop the march of modern science and modern technology <e> <s> nothing can stop it <e> <s> men are now being replaced by the machines which they themselves created <e> <s> that is a situation which will get steadily worse not better whatever government are in power <e> <s> i should like to urge the government to give some consideration to the problem that while we have a substantial very well paid highly technical pool of workers we shall soon have at least as large a pool of unemployed with nothing to do because the machines are doing it for them <e> <s> can we consider some method by which these young people can be given a life worth living unconnected with technical production <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for one moment to say that he should add that the original man of them all was the late mr noel skelton <e> <s> he used for the first time the phrase property-owning democracy <e> <s> he was member of parliament for central perth for many years and he ought to be remembered in that connection <e>", "<cs> i am so old <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that unless something pretty drastic is done other than by reducing the size of the police force which is now proposed very soon the only way to get about london will be to walk <e> <s> does he also realise that that is the only thing that i can no longer do and i am not alone <e>", "<cs> but you are abolishing it <e>", "<cs> and coaches my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i came here with the intention of voting for this amendment because i know of the immense services that the noble lord lord strabolgi has rendered to the arts in the past and no doubt will in the future <e> <s> but i must say that i have been convinced by the speeches which have been made that the proper authority for running the arts whether we have a local government bill or not and whatever happens to the glc is the arts council <e> <s> i have great confidence in sir william rees-mogg and in all the work that he has done <e> <s> i believe apart from the financial reasons cogently advanced by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the proper authority to administer the arts throughout this country is the arts council for which it has been set up and about which there has been no complaint yet made to justify interfering with the powers that they already have <e> <s> therefore i intend greatly to my own surprise to support the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to deliver the briefest speech that i have ever made in parliament and as one who has sat in parliament for quite a long time i want only to say that i sincerely hope that your lordships will pass this amendment because after studying the terms of the amendment and listening to the speeches with great care i am convinced that if it is not passed the government of london will very soon be reduced to a disorderly shambles <e> <s> i can see no other way <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was a member of the council of europe for many years may i thank the noble viscount most sincerely for making it abundantly clear that in the view of her majestys government it is the lack of political unity and purpose that is causing a hold-up right across the european front <e> <s> will he repeat that on every possible occasion and make it perfectly plain to the european countries that unless and until the political relationship between the various nations concerned is more clearly defined and means are found to make it much easier to carry out political decisions reached by the community as a whole we shall make no progress in other fields <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down does he really believe that in the long run in the modern world an international committee can sit down at geneva to make rules for the conduct of modern war in much the same way that the rules committee sits down at st andrews to make rules for the conduct of the game of golf <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i want to support this amendment <e> <s> the date of th august is a day that will always be imprinted on my mind <e>

that period <e> <s> i took the view that the house was very much happier at the end of that time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he agree that all history shows that it is nearly always advisable for the english to follow the scots <e> <s> when they do not the result is nearly always fatal <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not realise that the scottish legal system based on roman law is acknowledged all over the world as being infinitely superior to the english system and by the law lords themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer does the noble lord not recollect that when i asked this question about a month ago he said that the traffic authority for central london was the glc and he went on to say that good progress was being made <e> <s> since then the only progress that i can see made by the glc has been towards the grave <e> <s> i want to ask the noble lord for an assurance that her majestys government now intend to set up some kind of effective traffic authority in london that will do a good job and have adequate powers and that will not just sit by and watch london traffic invaded from all sides by heavy vehicles especially coaches to the extent that it is being steadily reduced to chaos <e> <s> that is what is happening at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give us a hint of the likely decision of the government <e> <s> we are very interested and it has been quite a long time since the amendment was passed <e>", "<cs> my lords is not denmark the only country now seeking to change the regulations laid down in the european fisheries agreement with a view to limiting the by-catch of immature fish for industrial purposes <e> <s> if so can he promise us the most strenuous opposition with other european countries to that change which would go a long way to destroy the inshore fishing industry in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it would be better for the public to play bingo on the telephone than to watch violence on the screen <e>", "<cs>

down <e> <s> does he agree that lord wolfenden was a good chairman of the university grants committee and that he proved that the system could be made to work well <e> <s> i had personal experience as

obligations as the leading fishing port in europe and that the whole of the north of scotland will greatly benefit as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why there has been no comparable trouble in the prison service in scotland where the main convict prison at peterhead is in my old constituency <e> <s> there has been no trouble there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he realises that for the last years the whole world has suffered from recurrent economic depressions amounting to crises causing much unemployment and poverty and that the primary
