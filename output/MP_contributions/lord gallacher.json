["<cs> my lords i have opted to speak on a somewhat controversial subject as the debate so far has shown but i hope to do this in a non-controversial way <e> <s> if i stray over the narrow dividing line i hope for the understanding which i am told your lordships usually extend to first-year apprentices <e>", "<cs> my lords the main problem facing school-leavers arises from the absence of employment which is partly due to the world recession and the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the suggestion that this is not to apply retrospectively will to some extent defeat the whole object of the exercise <e> <s> would it not be worth considering following the precedent which was adopted in the case of seat belts whereby on the basis of registration annually the problem of the backlog might be tackled with benefit to all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first join in what has now become the heedless hymn of praise to the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> one of the minor compensations of being a member of sub-committee d apart from a ringside seat when farmers disagree among themselves is that even at a ripe old age there is still a great deal to learn about the art of chairmanship and we are all indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> lord plowden for that <e> <s> the common agricultural policy is the most difficult aspect of all european community affairs and yet as has already been pointed out <e> <s> it is basic to the european community <e> <s> finn gundelach the late commissioner for agriculture said that without the cap there would not have been the free movement for manufactured goods throughout the community and without the free movement of manufactured goods there would have been no european community in the first place <e> <s> for these reasons mr gundelach said that he would fight to eliminate structural surpluses because they would destroy the cap <e> <s> this constituted a very succinct defence of the cap as such yet it is ironic that divergence of green rates and the use of monetary compensation amounts to correct these have resulted in impediments to the movements of foodstuffs throughout member states <e>", "<cs> i intervene on this matter on the basis that i had personal experience of serving on this committee both before and after the transfer of buses and the tube to the glc <e> <s> i can say with certainty that the committee when it had full responsibility for buses tubes and the suburban railways had a very difficult assignment not least because the officials of london transport as distinct from the officials of british rail were a particularly difficult group of officers to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords the welfare state is geared to the concept of full employment <e> <s> without it either rates of taxation direct and indirect are high or benefits do not match expectations <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord stanley but i feel that in our consideration of it we need to go rather wider than the position of the grower because if this kind of situation does arise there will be more at stake than our crops which are within the control of the farmer <e> <s> for example the process of food manufacture and distribution is a fairly lengthy one and if particular crops are thought to be contaminated then of course there will be consequential loss arising in respect of stocks held for processing or already processed by food manufacturers and stocks which are somewhere in the distribution chain <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for the amendment and i strongly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his observations and no less grateful to those noble lords on all sides of the house who have seen some merit in this amendment <e> <s> in that spirit i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords given that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that to be thinking in terms of halving the level of the subsidy in will unless alternative sources of funding are found have a very serious effect on the value of the soil survey as such <e> <s> will he not further agree that this may well coincide with some of the toughest decisions which the ministry of agriculture has to take regarding the future of land use in this country stemming directly from reviews by the european community of support prices for agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i will first say that we on this side of the house welcome this scheme although perhaps for reasons different from those advanced by the noble earl in moving it <e> <s> when the central council for agricultural and horticultural co-operation as it then was came under the wing of the newly-formed food from britain organisation there was some concern that it would be dwarfed by what was essentially a marketing organisation and a marketing organisation whose life is finite in the sense that it is to enjoy public funding for its marketing activities only for a specified number of years after which trade interests are supposed to step in and provide money <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether if the government decide to take the route of abolition that will include the agricultural wages council <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has covered a wide area as inevitably it had to do having regard to the breadth of the subject matter included in the motion <e> <s> all of us are indebted as already stated to my noble friend lord john-mackie not merely for putting down the motion but also for introducing it in the manner that he did <e> <s> in our determination to find a suitable policy for rural areas we must not forget those who live in urban areas <e> <s> for them the rural enivironment is important if only because in so many instances the urban environment is something to get away from <e> <s> those of us who have lived and worked in towns all our lives are disappointed that after so many years of prosperity the approach by train for example to many of our towns and cities can still be a depressing experience in spite of the importance of town and country planning legislation <e> <s> indeed planning consent can sometimes be construed as a licence to do what one likes after one has got it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that explanation and i can assure the noble lord that what he said has been taken down and may be used in evidence against him in another place <e> <s> therefore i think that the review of the common agricultural policy which is now in prospect and which sub-committee d has in hand as part of the decisions taken in relation to this years price review which has not yet been completed is a considerably important review and one which i hope in due course will come <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply perhaps i should declare an involvement in this matter as i acted as one of the assessors to the shops inquiry committee <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister accept that to the best of my recollection and belief none of the national organisations which submitted evidence to the committee suggested later closing times than those specified in the question <e> <s> in view of that fact and the further fact that in the taking of oral evidence later shopping times than those specified were not much examined by the inquiry committee will the minister suggest to his right honourable friend the secretary of state that before proceeding to total abolition there should be some consultation with national organisations representative of consumers retailers shop workers and local authorities to ascertain the practicality and desirability of what the auld committee finally recommended <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord john-mackie for his reminder that modern skills have their counterpart in former skills <e> <s> indeed as i listened to him and in particular his reference to journeys overseas i was reminded of the turn-round of the famous churchillian phrase give us the job and we will finish the tools <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that <e>", "<cs> my lords we must thank the noble lord the minister not merely for introducing the order but also for the comprehensive speech that he made in explaining the role and function of credit unions which in northern ireland are highly developed and which in the rest of mainland britain regrettably have yet to make any impact following the passing of the act in this country <e> <s> just as the act in mainland britain was based largely on northern ireland custom and practice at the time going back to the legal format that was given in so too the order before us tonight is of considerable importance <e> <s> inevitably although it restates largely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is worth putting on record at the outset that support for agriculture at least in britain pre-dates our entry into the common market <e> <s> the milk marketing boards of the s the major agricultural act of and subsequent legislation all show clearly that before britain became a member of the ec we accepted in principle the concept of support for farming <e> <s> consumers are sometimes inclined to overlook that fact and i think that it needs to be stressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should begin by declaring an interest <e> <s> i acted as an assessor to the shops inquiry committee and as such i read carefully the main volume of evidence submitted to the committee <e> <s> i read a summary of all the evidence i made an assessment of it for the benefit of the committee of which the chairman expressed appreciation and i read the oral transcripts in respect of those witnesses who were invited by the inquiry committee to give oral evidence <e> <s> at the end of that labour of love the only thing i found out about the shops act which i did not know when i started was that if a funeral undertaker takes an order on the afternoon of early closing day then he is very probably breaking the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that observation <e> <s> it is a fact and it has not been brought out in the debate so far i am glad that the noble baroness has done so <e> <s> shops are already entitled to open at a minute past midnight <e> <s> there is no opening time for shops so that much of what we have heard tonight about the difficulties of extending shopping hours applies to only one end of the day <e> <s> quite properly the law allows newsagents and people like that to open at five oclock in the morning if they so wish because the public convenience is well served by it <e> <s> therefore in any consideration of this proposition it is true that the bill before us recommends opening hours a week weeks in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say whether there has yet been any contact between the food from britain organisation and the sea fish industry authority <e> <s> if there has been no contact will be use his good offices to bring that about as marketing is part of the remit of the sea fish industry authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating to this house a statement made in the other place <e> <s> as regards the proposals for the extension of the sugar regime for a further five years with quotas at present levels for two years may i ask the minister whether the government are aware of the considerable dissatisfaction in the united kingdom with the way in which the sugar regime as such is operating <e> <s> on the one hand manufacturers are saying that it results in sugar which is very expensive and that it disadvantages them <e> <s> on the other hand refiners are saying that the present arrangement of quotas is needlessly favourable to certain member states and consequently disadvantageous to britain <e> <s> will the minister suggest to his right honourable friend that the time may be opportune to ask the commission in brussels to institute a thoroughgoing review of the whole operation of the sugar regime <e> <s> these dissatisfactions can then be looked at in some detail to see whether or not the regime which is supposed to be self-financing is achieving all that was hoped of it when it was first introduced and whether other measures might not be appropriate at the end of the five-year period to which the statement refers <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell us whether the use of straw as a constituent in animal feeding is now being considered <e> <s> i ask this particularly in view of the decreasing importance of yield in regard to agricultural production <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank all those speakers who have taken part in what i think has been a useful debate and one which i hope we shall be able to study in <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of support for this amendment for reasons which i hope briefly to put before the committee <e> <s> first what we are dealing with in this bill is not merely sunday trading but sunday and sunday night trading <e> <s> it is not weekday trading along the present pattern of weekday trading under the shops act <e> <s> it is the legalising of the right of retailers to be open from one minute after midnight until on the same day <e> <s> thus in effect what the bill seeks to legalise and what the auld committee recommended was that the shops of this country if they so wish can be open for hours a week <e> <s> that by any stretch of the imagination represents a major change in the social habits and the life of the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the reply of the noble baroness more than a trifle disappointing <e> <s> she had nothing to say about the protection of consumers over a -hour shopping period <e> <s> presumably it may happen the last time this was raised i remember the noble baroness made a remark to the effect that it was all tinned beans that were sold out of hours <e> <s> i hope that she will not persist in those arguments because undoubtedly there is a body of law for the protection of consumers which was put on the statute book only with great difficulty and which it is essential should continue in force so long as shops are open <e> <s> it serves the cause of consumers very little to say that you may shop hours a day but that you will have very little protection during those hours when county council inspectorates are not available to enforce the law <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand that the noble and learned lord lord templeman is not to say anything more perhaps i may on your behalf thank him for the very lucid exposition which he gave of his sub-committees report on the milk outgoers scheme and join my colleagues in thanking him for putting up with members of sub-committee d during the preparation of that important report <e> <s> it has been a very useful debate wide-ranging as always when farmers get together and very realistic <e> <s> i think some useful thoughts have emerged even though perhaps the noble earl lord ferrers in an outstanding speech may have spread gloom and despondency a little too far because in my own opinion there are solutions if member states are prepared to grasp them <e>", "<cs> on behalf of these opposition benches may i say that we are sympathetic to the amendment which the noble lord lord diamond has moved <e> <s> our sympathy is based on a number of considerations which i hope the minister will take into account when he comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine myself mostly to clauses to of the bill <e> <s> fortuitously they are the clauses about which i know a little and they are also the clauses which despite speeches have been least discussed <e> <s> the first question i should like to ask is whether the home grown cereals authority and the meat and livestock commission described in the bill as non-departmental public bodies are really in the best statutory form for the tasks they are called upon to undertake in this bill and which they will certainly have to discharge in the future <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should begin with a confession which is that in an otherwise unblemished youth i served for six years on a regional gas consumers council <e> <s> i have kept in touch with that regions reports ever since although i no longer live in their area <e> <s> thus i have some idea of the routine of the work and of the value of what they did as has already been pointed out in an unpaid voluntary capacity so far as concerns representation of the consumer in the region for which they were responsible <e> <s> i share totally in the view that the fact of their being unpaid strengthened their work and strengthened the work of the committee <e>", "<cs> in view of the very satisfactory reply made by the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for the answer he has given us <e> <s> in view of that and in view of the assurance he has offered us particularly about the proposal to ensure standards of safety of the appliances by the department of trade and industry which i think was the main thrust of a recent television programme on the subject i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the promise that the noble lord the minister has given about wider publicity for existing services and the assurance that he has given my noble friend lord bruce about the future i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister allow that if there is an offset even though it is at present too soon to calculate what it is it might be used to allow his right honourable friend the minister to designate perhaps more areas than the six originally chosen <e> <s> in publishing a list of some from which the selection of six has been made undoubtedly some disappointment has been generated in those areas which have not been selected on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the ministers statement particularly his opening statement and i shall certainly read it in detail when it appears in <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at the document cmnd <e>", "<cs> i think that the ministers reply though not unexpected is somewhat disappointing <e> <s> indeed if i may say so without disrespect to the government front bench it follows the tenor of all the replies we have had to all the amendments on the four previous committee days and i think that it indicates in some measure a fairly closed mind so far as the government are concerned which in itself is indicative of a determination to see this bill not merely on the statute book which would be understandable and acceptable but on the statute book without any single amendment <e> <s> we on these benches at least find that to be completely unacceptable <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply is quite disappointing <e> <s> he paid me the compliment of saying that i was persuasive <e> <s> all i can say in answer to that is i am grateful for the fact that i am not being paid by results <e> <s> if so i should be in danger of dying from starvation <e> <s> i do not believe that the suggested delays to consumers that the minister has mentioned are not capable of being borne by consumers <e> <s> neither do i believe that the analogy with the united states that the minister called in aid that public hearings there had resulted in delays in price increases would be likely to find disfavour with consumers in the united kingdom <e> <s> my own view is that a public hearing will satisfy the legitimate interests of a wide variety of people as to what is happening <e> <s> moreover it will have the effect ultimately of reducing the number of rejections subsequent to the granting of an authorisation if people have had their say before the authorisation itself has been granted <e> <s> therefore to <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his remarks <e> <s> it seemed to be that he was damning the amendment with faint praise <e> <s> having twice denied me the opportunity of success with earlier amendments i <e>", "<cs> i think we are all agreed that the problem of debts is a very real one not merely for british gas british gas plc the electricity boards british telecom you should talk to funeral undertakers <e> <s> you should also talk to people who rent out television sets <e> <s> it is widespread and we do not seek in this amendment to minimise it <e> <s> what we seek to do perhaps unsuccessfully is to mitigate it for certain categories of people by specifying the kind of security which we think is fair and reasonable in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers reply somewhat disappointing though not surprising <e> <s> he referred to paragraph and stated that the onus is placed on public gas suppliers to supply an appropriate meter whether prepayment or otherwise <e> <s> he did not tell the committee what constitutes an appropriate meter <e> <s> who makes the judgment <e> <s> is the public gas suppliers judgment as to the appropriateness of a meter challengeable or is it entirely a decision reserved for the public gas supplier <e> <s> if it is entirely the decision of the public gas supplier then i think that the protection afforded by paragraph is perhaps rather less than the minister indicated to the committee <e>", "<cs> if that is the governments final position on this clause at this stage we find the answers unsatisfactory <e> <s> there is obviously no sympathy with the concept of giving the gas consumers council any role as regards prices <e> <s> it has also emerged that the supplier is entitled to fix the prices <e> <s> provided that he does so in accordance with the tariff and unless there is any infringment of that tariff the director has no jurisdiction in the matter <e>", "<cs> may i say in answer to the response of the minister and he will not be surprised to hear this that it is disappointing <e> <s> he claims that condition of the authorisation repeats the position of consumer councils under the gas act <e> <s> this may be so in large measure but surely it does not apply to prices because that power has very definitely been taken away from the gas consumer councils under the proposals now before us <e> <s> clause it is said gives greater information powers to the gas consumers council <e> <s> of course we shall reach a consideration of that clause in due course <e>", "<cs> we shall not move amendment no <e> <s> aa <e> <s> we are however in support of the amendments of the noble lord lord diamond nos <e> <s> a and b and we are also in support of amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> i note with appreciation the rather sympathetic response the minister has given to c although not to the other two amendments <e> <s> i presume that that indicates that when we come to amendment a he may be sympathetically disposed towards it <e> <s> in the meanwhile we support the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and for those parts of it that have given some measure of reassurance namely that gas showrooms will continue to operate and that they will be allowed to perform the services that they currently do <e> <s> it may have been even more reassuring had the minister not mentioned the trend that showrooms were closing but that new showrooms were opening in other centres <e> <s> my advice is that there are at the present time showrooms whereas in there were showrooms <e> <s> that represents a fairly substantial reduction during a period when the gas industry has <e>", "<cs> the ministers reassurance is not totally satisfactory <e> <s> while admittedly this problem on the basis of the evidence collected by the office of fair trading is linked to electricity rather than gas there may well be tenants using gas who are equally disadvantaged <e> <s> the failure to deal with the problem of overcharging in respect of electricity may perversely enough encourage a spread of the problem to charging for gas <e> <s> therefore while one is to some extent reassured by the ministers statement that in forthcoming legislation there will be powers to make orders to deal with electricity it appears that with regard to the present position it is only electricity that is considered to be in need of treatment and that the position on gas can remain much as it is <e> <s> i think that that too is probably an unsatisfactory state of affairs but it is a matter for the noble baroness lady burton of coventry to judge <e>", "<cs> the ministers answer has been discouraging although he said that the concept advanced by my noble friend had been examined in the ministry and rejected <e> <s> we feel that it may be worthy of further examination <e> <s> of the alternatives so far canvassed this seems to us to be the most practicable as my noble friend pointed out and in the long term the best way to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> that is a somewhat disappointing reply from the minister <e> <s> i agreed with him when he said that we are dealing not so much with a farming policy as with a social policy <e> <s> if there were any way of taking this problem out of the realm of the cap and into the realm of some other aspect of community financing i think everyone would be happy <e> <s> but in point of fact the commission seem determined to keep these schemes within the ambit of the common agricultural policy and therefore we must deal with them as we find them rather than as we should like them to be <e>", "<cs> we do not oppose the proposal but the noble lord the minister will recall that earlier this evening i said that levies would be one way of financing the supplementary cash requirement which the government now need for adas <e> <s> i am glad that safeguards are being built in <e> <s> i hope that the scheme will work as smoothly as it sounded when the noble lord outlined it <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the ministers reply somewht disappointing because it is obvious on this side of the house that the structure of the staff of the director is to be a civil service affair <e> <s> that means establishments and all that jazz and it allows very little flexibility from the point of view of the director in recruiting people with specialist skills to discharge specialist tasks <e> <s> let us imagine within the framework of the establishment a situation in which immediately under the director who as i understand from information given previously is to have the rank of a deputy secretary in the civil service the no <e> <s> in the department is an under-secretary and that that is virtually the only under-secretary that the treasury is prepared to authorise within a staffing complement as low as people <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i thank other noble lords who have <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not echo the words of the noble lord lord diamond regarding the effect of the guillotine on our deliberations except to say that even without a guillotine we have endeavoured in this house on these benches at least to co-operate fully with the government <e> <s> indeed that co-operation will be carried even further on amendment no <e> <s> because we do not propose to seek a division on it in view of the fact that we have divided on a similar amendment previously <e> <s> nevertheless i think that it is an important amendment <e> <s> i believe that the ministers response to it has been disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords as amendment no <e> <s> is being discussed with this amendment it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak to it at this stage <e> <s> it will be recalled that in committee we tried to open up this clause in the belief that the public hearing procedure gave the secretary of state the opportunity to practise open government <e> <s> we argued that it need not be bureaucratic or time-consuming or too revealing or expensive <e> <s> we referred to the fact that public hearings were common in the united states system but we did not wish slavishly to follow that system although we did not regard the united states system as being devoid of merit <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak at this stage to amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with the amendment just moved by the noble lord <e> <s> the object of amendment no <e> <s> is again in line with the statement made by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> the government have chosen price control through the tariff formula as their main method of regulation of a monopoly supplier <e> <s> with say a changed directorate it is possible in our view that the monopoly supplier may institute cuts in the standard <e>", "<cs> my lords as amendment no <e> <s> is also relevant in this context it would perhaps be for the convenience of the house if i spoke to it now <e> <s> clause seems to us to be heavily loaded in favour of the gas supplier <e> <s> provided that he is operating within the tariff laid down any reading of clause leads one to think that the gas supplier may do what he likes <e> <s> any changes he makes to the tariff can be as complex as he likes and as bewildering as he is capable of devising <e> <s> provided that no one can prove that anything within the tariff structure is not in accordance with the tariff scheme he is free to proceed as he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the ministers reply and to the speeches in opposition to this amendment <e> <s> first of all i should say that when i quoted the figure relating to the number of disconnections i quoted accurately the figure given to me covering the two years and it is significantly less than the figure quoted by the minister and i shall make further inquiry regarding the figures that i have <e> <s> it may be that included in my disconnections are electricity disconnections that may explain the discrepancy but i shall certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister seeks to disarm me by telling me how good british gas is in this area <e> <s> that is not in dispute <e> <s> the noble lord the minister seeks further to disarm me by telling me that after privatisation british gas will be by far the largest public gas supplier and that is not in dispute <e> <s> what the noble lord did not touch on was why if it is necessary to make a provision of this kind in order to give information about escapes of gas he considers paragraph as currently drafted superior to the amendment we have put down <e> <s> with due modesty since i did not draft it i think that the amendment we have put down is superior and will give the public better reassurances than they currently have <e> <s> i do not doubt that in a situation in which there was an escape of gas not being the responsibility of british gas plc they will take pretty prompt action to deal with it in the interest of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords disappointment with the ministers reply is well encapsulated in the speech made by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i think what the minister fails to grasp is that british gas plc is a different organisation <e> <s> we have the feeling that the regional aspect of british gas with which the public has been familiar since even if it does not totally disappear i refer to segas and north thames gas and the various other regions up and down the <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in no sense to detract from the significance of the bill which your lordships are about to pass but rather to draw attention to what i regard as a piece of fiscal impartiality which will flow following the passing of the bill on to the statute book <e> <s> i refer to the impact of the new powers being given to the building society movement to make unsecured loans upon credit unions and in particular to what i regard as the probable demise of the credit union movement as a result of those powers unless certain action is taken by the government to achieve what i have already described as fiscal impartiality between the two movements <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell the house whether those bodies which engage in generic advertising much of which is financed by commodity levies are going to integrate their advertising programmes with food from britain possibly on a co-funding basis <e> <s> is the noble lord satisfied that liaison between these parties and food from britain is in all respects adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may thank the noble lord lord seebohm for the manner in which he introduced his report and spoke about the other reports which are to follow the one on taxation <e> <s> i have to deal with the internal market for foodstuffs and some proposals regarding the internal market for meat <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that even if it were possible to water down the product liability directive the very act of so doing would reduce the value of the protection which the directive aims to give consumers <e> <s> does he further agree that the reputation of the food processing industry in this country is so high that it should be possible for it to obtain the necessary insurance at fairly modest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords we must first of all thank the minister for explaining in such detail the sequence of events arising from the accident at chernobyl and the consequential damage which it caused throughout europe and in particular in the specified areas of the united kingdom <e> <s> we little thought when we were taking the food and environment protection act through this house last year that the first use of its provisions would apply to an external hazard <e> <s> i am sure that at that time most of us imagined that the powers were not likely to be used at all and that if they were they would more likely be used internally than externally <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak principally to part iii of the bill entitled misleading price indications which in the vernacular of the trade can be reduced to bargain offers <e> <s> this is an important part of the bill <e> <s> i am glad that it has already been welcomed on all sides of the house because <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone has moved amendments nos <e> <s> and as well as no <e> <s> <e> <s> i address my remarks specifically to no <e> <s> because that is the amendment which commends itself mostly to this side of the committee <e> <s> we are of the opinion that the noble lord lord mottistone is quite correct to ask for an approved person rather than the words currently in the bill namely by any person <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the response that he has made to this amendment which i readily accept and in the light of which i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to my noble friend lord john-mackie not merely for the way in which he introduced the debate but for persuading the official opposition to have such a debate <e> <s> the quality of the speeches this evening bears <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have taken part in the consideration <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his response and for the offer he has made which i gladly accept <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply to this amendment <e> <s> in particular i am grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for his support <e> <s> like him on first hearing i thought the reply to the amendment was somewhat terse <e> <s> the mere mention of motor manufacturers recommended prices made me almost wish that i was in another place <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful that the assurance was given that there will be some further consideration of it <e> <s> although we are not expecting that consideration to take a very tangible form at report stage i am nevertheless grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the remarks that he has made in connection with this amendment <e> <s> i could not help smiling to myself when he spoke of the time it will take to redraft this code on the assumption that redrafting is necessary <e> <s> we were all very lenient with him <e> <s> now we find that in certain circumstances though not in these circumstances codes can be drawn up by other people submitted to the director general of fair trading and the secretary of state and subject to parliamentary approval they are a <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for his further clarification of the attitude of the government to the amendment <e> <s> i can only say that if this wide range of additional consultation is necessary in respect of the code which is occupying our prime attention then much the same considerations would apply to any code because the mere fact that it came from the trade association or a body equally representative of the sector would not mean that all the constituents of that sector had played a part in the formulation of the code <e> <s> neither would it mean that other parties who may be interested or affected by it would take a similar view <e> <s> that leads me to think that the wording of the clause

reply he has made <e> <s> i have taken very careful note of all that he has had to say <e> <s> however on this side of the committee we feel that the affirmative procedure is appropriate in these circumstances particularly having regard to the additional remarks made by my noble friend lord williams of elvel when he drew attention to clause of the bill <e> <s> i think that the affirmative procedure gives the house the opportunity that it needs and if an order has passed the other place this house has a code of conduct of its own in regard to these matters which i am happy to say is strictly observed <e> <s> nevertheless even within the code there is an opportunity for discussion for comment and for the passing of opinions upon the content of the regulation as well as its validity and indeed its necessity <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> my first response is that there appears to be a reliance upon what the european court might say about a longer period of detention under article <e> <s> on the other hand one is conscious of the fact that the commission of the european communities in its desire to protect consumers of the community effectively has set up machinery whereby unsafe goods are notified by member states through the commission so that in effect the community states are all protected by a prior system of notification <e> <s> whether that system of notification can be safely triggered on the basis of the kind of inspection to which the minister has referred that is taking place within a period of hours is a moot point <e> <s> i should like to consider that in relation to his further reference to article <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the minister for repeating in this house a statement made in the other place <e> <s> the statement is a fairly quiet document and yet this side of the house has the feeling that certain matters contained in the statement herald further changes in agriculture which could be of considerable significance <e> <s> i want to ask the minister one or two questions about those aspects of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords as almost all the speakers who have taken part in the debate have said complimentary things about the report it would be churlish of me to attempt any kind of reply to those remarks particularly in view of the comprehensive reply which the minister has given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords as marketing is at the heart of this question can the noble lord say whether the government are satisfied that major british food retailers are adequately represented on the council of food from britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the reply he made to this amendment <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord mottistone for the words he had to say which seemed to indicate support for it <e> <s> i followed as closely as i could the explanation which the minister gave and the distinction which he drew between subsections and <e> <s> i am sure that there is a distinction <e> <s> in the sober cold of morning and with the aid of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the assurance that we on this side of the house welcome the answer which he has given to his noble friend <e> <s> will he also ask his right honourable friend the minister in opposing the proposal to remind the officials of the commission that one of the three objectives of the common agricultural policy is the maintenance of fair prices to consumers and that this proposal completely contradicts that objective <e> <s> will the minister further advise his right honourable friend to say to the commissioners that the proposition of financing surpluses in other respects out of a levy on oils and fats is totally inimicable to the objectives of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank all those who have taken part in the debate and i particularly thank the minister for the very patient and detailed reply which he has given to the proposition put forward in amendment no <e> <s> i note that in accepting that amendment he also accepts amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for this amendment which meets entirely the promise he made at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome all three of these amendments <e> <s> they have been promised and i think they are fully justified <e> <s> although they may apply only to a minority of landlords undoubtedly this is a cause of severe hardship <e> <s> in consequence we fully support the amendments <e> <s> the noble baroness lady burton of coventry who has made this cause especially her own will doubtless wish to say something more about the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment moved by my noble friend lord graham of edmonton seems to me to be modest in scope and sincere in intent <e> <s> if i understand him aright both the ama and the acc believe that not only would it give them a degree of flexibility but that it could have the added incentive that it might save them money <e> <s> whether it will save ratepayers money or treasury money i would not at this point care to guess because the more i hear of local government finance the more happy i am that i have only ecus and european finance to worry about and they are quite enough to be going on with at present <e> <s> nevertheless i think the government could perhaps make a reasonable and positive response to this amendment and i sincerely hope it will be possible for them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was moved at the committee stage of the bill and it elicited an unsympathetic response from the government <e> <s> at that time i think we would have been gratified if the government spokesman had indicated even a willingness to consider restoring the period to one of hours which was deleted from the consumer safety amendment bill at its third reading stage in the house of commons <e> <s> the local authority associations were disconcerted by that change coming so late in the passage of a bill <e> <s> consequently as my noble friend lord graham of edmonton has pointed out they are equally disconcerted to find that the -hour period now enshrined in the consumer safety amendment act is being written into this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in the discussion on the committees report including of course my noble friend lady elliot of harwood <e> <s> the level of the discussion has amplified many of the propositions contained in the report <e> <s> it has been sustained at a high level as i should expect having regard to the participants <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank the noble lord for introducing so clearly the details of the order <e> <s> in one respect as he says it breaks new ground namely the introduction of the species promotion levy <e> <s> it was gratifying to hear that producers apparently are in great haste to see the levy introduced and indeed to pay it <e> <s> that is a novel situation in the meat trade so far as i am concerned <e> <s> i hope that the producers will be satisfied with the outcome of the expenditure for which the levy now provides maximum rates in respect of cattle sheep and pigs <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble viscount lord hanworth for raising this question <e> <s> also we are particularly pleased to welcome the noble baroness lady trumpington back to the house in a new capacity <e> <s> i hope that she is enjoying the lusher pastures of whitehall place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that the code of practice is basic to the implementation of part iii of the act <e> <s> will he further agree that part iii of the act constitutes a small but necessary piece of legislation to assist consumers in general <e> <s> in view of this will the noble lord ask his noble friend the minister to use his best endeavours to speed up the consultation process <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> the committee will agree that he has made much of the capital grant position and is in effect telling the committee that having agreed to a form of words for capital grants we are consequently bound by that form of words for revenue grants <e> <s> i was always taught that there was no connection between capital and revenue expenditure though i always had great difficulty in making the distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble baronesses and all the noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> a particularly pleasing feature of it so far as i am concerned is that there was practically no repetition in any of the speeches made so that taken as a piece this should make useful reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as britain is concerned will the noble baroness allow that her ministrys press release announcing the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i first congratulate the noble baroness on the manner in which she has both introduced and explained this rather important bill <e> <s> i believe without anticipating what other speakers in the debate may say that most people will wish to welcome its general aims <e> <s> however in certain parts of <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble baroness agree that in as much as the set-aside scheme allowed a substantial measure of the national <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness seen the annual report of the board for in which it is recorded that staff turnover for that year was of the order of per cent <e> <s> and the shortage against the establishment was per cent <e> <s> will she not agree that that combination of figures is in part responsible for the delays about which the noble lord lord mottistone so rightly complains <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all members of your lordships house who have taken part in this important and interesting debate <e> <s> the speeches that have been made have filled out the details of the report before the house <e> <s> i express my thanks to the minister for the manner in which she has replied to the debate and for updating us so effectively on events subsequent to the drafting of our report <e> <s> in the jargon of this place i should like to say that i will study what she has said <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot promise to write to her because i have a lifelong rule never to put anything in writing to a lady and particularly to one as attractive as the noble baroness <e> <s> i commend the report to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that despite assurances he has given about the safety of this hormone there is considerable concern on the part of consumers in general about its likely effect on milk in the long term and consequently on health <e> <s> can he therefore assure the house that those concerns will be taken full account of by his ministry before further experiments are authorised <e> <s> even if those concerns are found to be perhaps lacking in scientific certainty will he take account of the fact that consumers may decide on the basis of their concerns real or misplaced that milk is no longer a safe commodity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all members of your lordships house who have taken part in the debate and for the quality of their contributions <e> <s> i should especially like to thank the minister for replying to the debate particularly in the circumstances which she was kind enough to mention to me <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that the set-aside scheme which requires per cent <e> <s> of the land to be set aside in order to qualify under it carries with it the risk of redundancy for many farm workers <e> <s> is the minister further aware that because of the nature of the farm industry the only protection that farm workers have is the statutory government scheme <e> <s> in those circumstances will the noble baroness ask her right honourable friend the minister to consider an approach to the commission whereby some of the co-responsibility levy paid upon cereals by british farmers is funnelled back to this country in order to top-up redundancy payments to workers who are made redundant by reason of set-aside <e>", "<cs> my lords in the matter of advice to the public on food safety although i recognise that the primary responsibility rests with the department of health does not the noble baroness agree that her ministry has a major interest as well <e> <s> does not some of the confusion which arises from time to time not merely about salmonella and eggs but about other commodities stem from the fact that the liaison between the department of health and her ministry is perhaps not as close as it might be <e> <s> as a consequence when statements are made by one ministry they may not have the same degree of emphasis as statements made by another ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house how many weeks supply the present reduced stockholding of butter in the community represents in relation to consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all share the noble baronesss pleasure at the news even <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> i agree with her that the hope must now be that the measures she has announced will result for both producers and consumers in the restoration of confidence in the egg industry and that the unhappy events of the past two weeks or more will soon be behind us <e> <s> that as we see it is as important for consumers as for producers of eggs and those who are working in the industry for whom the prospects without a restoration of confidence are exceedingly bleak <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement says the figure is around million <e>", "<cs> my lords with that correction is the estimated cost to the taxpayer of around million plus million to contractors and local authorities a complete statement in the sense that it includes wales scotland and northern ireland as well as england <e> <s> is it to be regarded as a finite sum of money <e> <s> further is it finite in terms of time <e> <s> the essence of this problem is that within the timescale allowed by the government the problem should have solved itself <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all thank the noble baroness for explaining in such detail the purpose of the order which we are considering this evening <e> <s> we on this side of the house warmly support the order not merely in its own right but in particular the thinking that lies behind it <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity of associating myself with the remarks she made about the work of the local branch of the nfu in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the scheme is in its fourth and final week is the minister in a position to tell the house whether the whole of the million earmarked for it is likely to be taken up <e> <s> can she say whether any credence should be attached to statements that the scheme as such has been of greater assistance to large producers than to small ones <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in agreement with the proposition that conservation is also concerned with observing the existing rules under the common fisheries policy <e> <s> is he satisfied that the communitys fisheries inspectorate at its present level and given the increase in the size of the community is adequate to ensure the continuing observance of the rules associated with the common fisheries policy <e> <s> this is particularly having regard to the suggestion that certain member states not i hasten to add great britain are prone to observe the rules perhaps more in the breach than in the observance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for the remarks she made in speaking to the proposal that the motion be approved <e> <s> when we looked at the no <e> <s> order quite recently affecting as it did the isles of scilly i said that there might possibly be a few more detailed comments in respect of this one <e> <s> i hope that in the time available to us she will accept that the points i wish to raise are considered by us to be of some consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that three of the four commodities with which comparison is invited by the noble lord are subject to commodity regimes under the european common agricultural policy <e> <s> will she further agree that the effect of that policy is to turn the laws of supply and demand on their heads <e> <s> does she agree that an enlightened revision of the common agricultural policy would be to the advantage of consumers and taxpayers alike and that that ought to be the object of government policy at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble earl for explaining as briefly and as succinctly as he has the purpose of the order <e> <s> we do well to remind ourselves on this occasion of consolidation that the chernobyl incident is now almost three years old and that we still as a result rightly have to engage in protection for the consumer which involves restrictions and limitations by the use of this wonderful array of colours on the

be kind enough to admit that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join with other noble lords in expressing my thanks to the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble earl lord dundee for explaining the import of the conservation grant scheme and the regulations attaching to it <e> <s> i spoke in some detail from this side of the house at col on th january about this matter so i am not proposing to repeat those remarks as the scheme confirms what we were told then and indeed further confirms the written answer announcing the prospect of change at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl agree that the urgency which his noble friend lord nugent of guildford advocated is very deeply felt both in this house and in the country as a whole <e> <s> can he say why implementation of the two major recommendations appears to be somewhat delayed <e> <s> is it in any way due to the failure of the ministry of agriculture and the department of health to work jointly on this serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking on behalf of those who claim to be healthy and who are certainly not hypochondriacs i must straight away say that i have no personal experience of having worked in either of the two ministries <e> <s> however i have had extensive experience of dealing with them <e> <s> perhaps that enables me to sec the problems from a different angle <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether the commission itself when making proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy considers the possibility of increased opportunities for fraud <e> <s> currently there is a proposal whereby the commission is hoping to increase the use of cereals in animal feedstuffs <e> <s> everyone who has looked at that proposal in both last years and this years budget is firmly of the opinion that the enhanced opportunities for fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a case for the ministry of agriculture asking the media to take a more balanced approach when commenting on food matters <e> <s> one sometimes finds within the same newspaper advice to do and not to do and within the same broadcasts similar information is coming across <e> <s> is this not confusing and bewildering to consumers <e> <s> would it not be appropriate for both the minsitry of health and the ministry of agriculture to use their best endeavours to ask the media to be more balanced in their comments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the problem with enforcement of regulations would be made easier if the present excess capacity of slaughtering were eliminated in england and wales <e> <s> in that connection will she tell the house what has become of the proposals by the meat and livestock commission several years ago for a reduction in capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that the response so far to invitations to individual firms and trade to accept financial responsibility for near market research has been somewhat disappointing <e> <s> does she agree that we have now reached a stage where a decision to apply the near market research category to research stations virtually ensures their closure <e> <s> in view of that situation and having regard to the talks she is to have with the industry in april and may will the noble baroness make it clear to the industry that in the event of the appeal for voluntary support meeting with a very disappointing response from the industry the government will not rule out the possibility of continuing essential near market research by means of a levy on trade <e>", "<cs> my lords we should remind ourselves although it is self-evident from the debate that the present structure of the water industry in england and wales stems entirely from the legislative endeavours of conservative governments <e> <s> so what is being changed has nothing to do with the labour party it is entirely to do with the present government <e> <s> indeed before coming to the debate this afternoon i took the liberty of reading the second reading speeches by the respective secretaries of state in and <e> <s> in contrasting their hopes and aspirations with the speech of the noble earl today on which i congratulate him one is led to consider what a strange game politics still can be <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for the remarks that he made to me personally <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for the explanation that he gave as regards the present position under subsection of this part of the bill <e> <s> i accept entirely the proposition that an attempt is to be made in the regulations to draw a fair distinction concerning responsibilities in this area between undertakers and consumers <e> <s> however i believe that the purpose of the amendment is quite frankly to place responsibility on the person best able to deal with it <e> <s> and as i have said that is the undertaker <e> <s> i believe that this is a problem that is likely to grow in incidence because of the extensive use virtually acknowledged by the minister of lead piping in old properties for taking water from the companys main into housing <e> <s> if it is to be replaced by reason of maintaining or improving water quality that will represent a fairly sizeable burden on the consumers as those of us who have had to take this action in recent months are well aware <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply and for his assurance that clause as it now stands imposes a duty to enforce regulations <e> <s> accordingly in view of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey i wish to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> zfa and zfb which are grouped with the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers answer somewhat disappointing <e> <s> it seems to me that having included a provision that will create an offence for supplying water that is unfit for human consumption he then went on to say that the standards for designating water as unfit for human consumption will be set so low that little use is likely to be made of the provision in

it and particularly of course those participants who supported the views expressed in both the amendments i moved <e> <s> i hope that the minister will not be surprised but nevertheless disappointed if i say that both his interventions seemed to me to be thoroughly unconvincing <e> <s> the fact of the matter is <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that explanation <e> <s> i grasp something of what he is trying to tell us <e> <s> however if the inference is that one can have a similar system for water to the white meter for electricity we are drawing analogies which cannot be justified in practical terms <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of newport in referring to the isle of wight accepted that it was early days to be drawing conclusions from the experiments there <e> <s> i do not wish to place too much emphasis on experiments anywhere because i think it is early days to assume that the experiments some of which are unofficial can point conclusively to one benefit or another in this area <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply and for setting out the position so far as concerns payment by instalments at the present time <e> <s> this question is one of considerable importance not least as i have already said in moving the amendment by reason of the size of water bills in the future but also for an additional reason namely that unless there is a system for easy payments by easy payments i mean not only payments which are easily made but payments made without cost to the customer there could be an increase in problems <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> cb

on the work of the rracs and secondly to give in some detail its response to initiatives by the rracs during the year in which the nra is reporting <e> <s> the fact that the minister is looking for this to be done ensures i believe that it will be done and that due publicity will therefore be given to the work of these important river committees <e> <s> for that reason it is appropriate for us

of local authority representatives consultations have already begun with the local authority associations with a view to suggesting names for representation <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will not be surprised to learn that we on this side of the house are somewhat disappointed with the case he has stated <e> <s> the minister has perhaps great complacency if that is not too strong a word about

gave rise to the amendment <e> <s> we were frankly seeking to put into the bill quite fairly the gist of what the minister then told the committee <e> <s> we now have a different situation in which an attempt to bring this into the bill is resisted on the grounds that local authorities already have that duty and that the tasks which they have to undertake as regards the bill are on balance lighter

noble earl for these amendments and for implementing the promise he made at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that on the basis of experience to date the designation of

regard to the number of speakers few aspects of the environment agriculture and food have not at least been mentioned during the course of the debate <e> <s> i propose not to say very much about the proposal in the gracious speech to strengthen the law on food safety <e> <s> as the noble earl lord selborne has already pointed out the second reading of that bill takes place in this house on th december <e> <s> the gracious speech also said that the government will carry forward reform of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> that is a subject which i know has been discussed many times in your lordships house it is one of very considerable importance <e> <s> introducing the debate the noble baroness lady trumpington had a great deal to say about the common agricultural policy <e> <s> i wish to say something about it but in a context that has not been discussed so far this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that people who make a living out of slaughtering animals in this country have described what is going on in spain as stomach-churning <e> <s> in view of that and the fact that this trade is likely to grow as far as concerns britain because of changes in the sheepmeat regime will she ask her right honourable friend to look at the excellent example given to this country over many years by the new zealand meat board and possibly consider asking the meat and livestock commission to constitute part of itself into an export board for this very purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all perhaps i may thank the noble baroness for explaining the food safety bill to us in such detail and with considerable clarity <e> <s> the bill has been generally welcomed by those people who are most interested in it and likely to be most affected by it <e> <s> in particular those who speak for consumers for the local authorities including the enforcement officers of those local authorities for producers and for retailers have all expressed general support for the bill <e> <s> however naturally they have reservations on a number of counts in respect of their own specific interests and in respect of specific clauses <e> <s> this support with reservations if i may so describe it promises an interesting committee stage for the bill in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble baroness for explaining so clearly as always the purpose of the order and the underlying thinking behind it as well as the fact that there are seven complementary orders if i may so describe them which are subject to the negative procedure and which are also due to be updated from st january <e> <s> we support the order and the other orders to which she referred and it follows that we support the intention behind the order <e>", "<cs> i have not intervened because in reply to an earlier comment the noble baroness seemed to indicate that she was amenable to consultation on this clause <e> <s> that satisfied me though i would have welcomed a closer definition of the form of consultation which she has in mind <e> <s> however later on she appears to have departed from that proposition because she was adopting a somewhat negative stance on the issue <e> <s> that was commented on by the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply which i shall study with care <e> <s> i am reassured by what she said i can only hope that those who advise me will be similarly reassured <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her remarks which i shall read carefully <e> <s> anglo-scots intervene in scottish affairs at grave risk <e> <s> i am aware of course that anglo-scottish footballers are often booed at hampden park before they have touched the ball <e> <s> that being so i shall look at what the minister said in particular at her references to the views of the secretary of state for scotland and the point she made that the district councils in scotland could if they wished appoint trading standards officers <e> <s> i shall also take into <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for confirming what she has already stated in regard to the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> this bill raises again and again the question of regulatory powers which the minister is necessarily taking <e> <s> in general the government are adhering to the view that such regulatory powers shall be subject to the annulment procedure <e> <s> that forces us to be selective in our approach to this question because we accept that there are limits to parliamentary time for discussing orders affirmatively <e> <s> nevertheless in respect of this amendment i will look at what the minister stated to see whether in the light of the assurances given by the noble baroness about consultation we can withdraw it with the leave of the committee and avoid the necessity of returning to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i thank the noble baroness for explaining to the committee what is in the governments mind and what appears to be in the mind of the european community as regards harmonisation of the law for food inspectors <e> <s> we have been under the impression perhaps the somewhat out of date impression that the community was happy enough to leave this matter to member states <e> <s> that has certainly been the situation in the past <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for the reassurance which she has given me particularly on the point that excessive intervention is not intended under this clause <e> <s> i note what she said about circumstances in which local authorities may lack the expertise to carry out particular work for example in the area of new technologies <e> <s> we have tabled a later amendment about novel foods and new technologies in general which may give us an opportunity of returning to this question <e> <s> i am reassured by the remarks of the noble baroness that the power is not a default power as that is covered in clause <e> <s> in the light of those remarks and the assurances i have been given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady hooper for her remarks regarding the amendment <e> <s> we see the subsection as a general affirmation of purpose which would be reinforced by the specific provisions in the bill to which she has made reference <e> <s> on this side of the house we have never quarrelled much with affirmations of purpose <e> <s> nevertheless i take the ministers point that the bill is strong in a number of areas and that it is the strength of those particular provisions which is likely to make the bill enforceable in a way in which existing legislation does not and which will add weight where that is regarded as being necessary <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for what she said and for the assurance she gave that the clause as it stands is likely to be more effective in protection of the consumer than the more general amendment that we would wish to see replacing the existing lines and <e> <s> those who are advising me must take the point of view on board and ask themselves whether it has validity <e> <s> because i ride two horses in this particular circus i can see that there is a very substantial element of validity <e> <s> when the noble lord lord mottistone quotes back at me the red kidney beans argument with which i opened the batting all i can say is thank you very much <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for the information which she has given <e> <s> i shall study it with care because the object of tabling the amendment <e>", "<cs> the assurance that an implementation advisory committee is contemplated allows me to beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> on this bench we sympathise with the case so ably advocated by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> a considerable loss of reputation can occur <e> <s> this may sometimes be quite long lasting and in a number of instances very damaging to a business in the circumstances which she described <e> <s> while we have no desire to see the provisions of the bill weakened in such a way as to render it less effective than it needs to be nevertheless the circumstances set out by the noble baroness need to be addressed by the government and sympathetically replied to <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy for the remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i referred specifically to the rather stringent nature of the clause as drafted when i spoke on the second reading of the bill <e> <s> some form of discretion should be available to the court to take account of circumstances that none of us quite frankly is capable of envisaging in an area as complex as this <e>", "<cs> i may not have been a microbiologist at the start of today but i believe that we shall all be microbiologists by the end of today <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving me the assurance which i sought that implicit in the clause as now worded is the intention of the government that the highest standards of food will prevail <e> <s> i hope that that will go some way to satisfying the intention behind this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her response to this amendment though naturally i am somewhat disappointed by it <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the comprehensive power already scheduled in clause f and in effect assured me that ministers would not hesitate to use those powers <e> <s> to replace necessary or expedient with the word desirable could allow ministers scope for being capricious and to that extent she has perhaps something of a case against the amendment as drafted <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to what has been an interesting debate i express my thanks to the noble lord lord middleton for giving us a preview of his committees report <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the comfort she has given me thus far in regard to the subject matter of the amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful for her reference to the select committee report a document i do not feel in the least inhibited in discussing during this committee stage <e> <s> to do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> she will not be surprised to hear that i am totally unconvinced by it <e> <s> it has been suggested that the effect of this amendment would be to put her majestys government in a situation in which they suspect that if plans are afoot they must delay <e> <s> with due deference the amendment says nothing of the kind <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness ignores <e> <s> is that event going to occur or not <e> <s> is all that is being said about it to be believed or not <e> <s> if member states are already irradiating food what are the impediments to a decision by the council of ministers <e> <s> it seems to me that the british attitude is that provided we proceed unilaterally the council of ministers can take as long as it wishes to introduce a directive on irradiated food <e> <s> that is a passive and defeatist attitude to the question it negates the spirit of <e> <s> i withdraw nothing and assure the noble <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite correct <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for not saying at the outset of my remarks that i was moving amendment no <e> <s> and speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i give that assurance now and hope that i can find my place in my script <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will reply to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i was also discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply to the group of amendments <e> <s> being very much a lay person in this area i shall need to study very carefully what she has said and to take advice from those who have asked me to assist them with this particular question <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that reply has a facility which almost bewilders and baffles me <e> <s> therefore i must in my own interests if not my own sanity take it away study it take advice and if necessary come back to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i may have misunderstood the purpose of the amendment because i was not aware that green-top milk was a major consideration <e> <s> i did not embarrass the noble baroness earlier when we were discussing food safety by drawing her attention to the disparity between regulations relating to unpasteurised milk in scotland and those in england and wales where the very safe pasteurisation process that she mentioned which was somewhat opposed when first introduced is now accepted as correct and normal <e> <s> of course the minister in england in response i admit to farm-gate pressure made an exception to permit unpasteurised milk called green-top to be sold provided that it is identified as such whereas in scotland a number of years ago they took the decision not to permit it and indeed it is not permitted <e>", "<cs> if that is the case i have no case to put before the committee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this side of the chamber we have much pleasure in supporting the amendment <e> <s> we strongly support the views expressed by the noble lord lord sainsbury of preston candover <e> <s> i am quite sure that no government of which i have experience certainly no government formed by this party on this side of the chamber would dream of using the clause in the manner that he suggests <e> <s> nevertheless for the purposes of food safety it seems to me a very wide insertion at this stage because these provisions are somewhat loosely drawn and could be misused in the manner in which he describes <e>", "<cs> the noble earls resistance is unnecessary <e> <s> he has jogged my memory about milk and dairies tribunals <e> <s> that point did not impress itself upon me when i first read this provision although i have reason to believe now that i am a member of a milk and dairies tribunal <e> <s> that is for the reason that no one else whom i approached at the material time would agree to serve <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> it has been represented to us that obstruction under the bill may be encouraged by the fact that the fine for obstruction which i believe is of the order of could seem to some people to be worth incurring to avoid an even greater fine if they did not obstruct and a more serious offence was detected <e> <s> that is partly the thinking behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance for which i thank the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am naturally disappointed with the ministers response because on a question of some considerable importance we are being by-passed in a way which is not worthy of the occasion <e> <s> we well know the ministers responsibility in these areas <e> <s> we are not in any way suggesting that that responsibility to parliament should be diminished <e> <s> neither are we suggesting that the consumer panel should be representative of bodies <e> <s> i made no such suggestion <e> <s> the choice of the membership of the consumer panel is entirely within the discretion of the minister <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before agreeing to the adoption of amendments nos <e> <s> b and c en bloc i should like a word from the minister about the effect of the amendments on the bill <e> <s> i have been looking at exactly what they say and i shall look at them again when they are reprinted <e> <s> would the minister care to tell us briefly why the necessity for amendment no <e> <s> c has arisen and whether it in any way weakens the provisions regarding emergency orders as the bill now provides for these <e>", "<cs> my lords in anticipation of the fact that eventually the dumping of chemical waste in the north sea will have to end are the government actively pursuing alternative sites <e> <s> in that pursuit will they take account of the importance of finding sites adjacent to the factories where waste is being generated <e> <s> will the minister also give us an assurance that those who generate chemical waste will be obliged to meet the full costs of disposal including the environmental costs <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all say to the committee its chairman and its specialist adviser that they have given us a wonderful report <e> <s> it is a document of great skill and lucidity for which the house is duly grateful <e> <s> the position as regards irradiated food has undoubtedly been complicated by the decision of the european parliament and the provisions of the single european act <e> <s> when we put our hands up so gaily for enacting the single european act we did not envisage some of the complications that might flow from it <e> <s> certainly such a complication exists as regards this directive <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not originally raise the query from these benches but we were happy to see that it was raised and equally happy with the explanation the noble baroness has given of the amendments now before us <e> <s> we note that we are to await a further amendment regarding drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord carter raised a question at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness and others who have spoken in this brief debate on the amendment for their contributions <e> <s> i shall do my best without taking up too much time to reply to some of the points which have been raised in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i construed that that was the line the noble baroness was taking <e> <s> if i have done her an injustice i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i was aware that the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes improved the climate somewhat <e> <s> i am grateful for it <e> <s> in those circumstances and in the light of what the minister said about improvement notices in general i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of opposing the amendment <e> <s> i accept the principle inherent in it and the good sense which lies behind it <e> <s> i intervene to express the hope that the granting of a facility to proceed against managers whilst fully justified in the circumstances which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> the amendment was in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> it has elicited some useful information from the noble baroness which will be studied <e> <s> in so far as it tells me something that i did not already know i am grateful <e> <s> i am sure that those who asked us to put down the amendment will be equally grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the grouping that took place after i approved the list of grouping that i saw this morning is inappropriate <e> <s> i have therefore moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when we reach amendment no <e> <s> i shall make a short speech in moving that amendment also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said on this important subject <e> <s> i believe that the reference to the international consultative group of the world health organisation to which i referred in moving the amendment is entirely appropriate <e> <s> i am partially reassured by the indication of the noble baroness that the government are conscious of the desirability of maintenance of standards but feel that these would be better taken care of in a code rather than in regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but i am not altogether reasssured by it <e> <s> for example she made a reference to experts but gave no indication of who they will be whether they will be invited in their individual capacities or as experts because they are currently employed in organisations which have recognised expertise in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that response <e> <s> the situation as envisaged here was one in which the authority was large enough to have a chief officer who would himself be independent of the officer who raised the matter in the first place <e> <s> it would certainly not be appropriate for a small authority to have the same officer acting by way of appeal as had originally issued the notice <e>", "<cs> my lords having added my name to the amendment i should say a few words in <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for the words of explanation she gave in relation to both these amendments <e> <s> as she has so rightly said they have been tabled rather late in the proceedings and at a very late hour this evening <e> <s> we shall not be opposing either of the amendments but i think it would be only fair to say that we shall need to take advice on the matter and if it is necessary to come back at third reading i hope the circumstances will be understood by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved a similar amendment to that which has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord ezra at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> quite frankly i was disappointed with the response that i received at the time from the minister <e> <s> i too have had the benefit of seeing the letter that the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden sent to the noble lord lord ezra on the subject <e> <s> it is admirably friendly and lucid in many ways <e> <s> however it finally comes down in favour of not making the concession for which the amendment i think reasonably asks <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage we moved a similar amendment to the one moved by the noble viscount lord falkland <e> <s> sadly we had no joy from the government on that occasion <e> <s> i do not anticipate any change of heart in spite of the noble viscount lord falklands eloquence this afternoon <e> <s> nevertheless the opposition firmly support the principle that the government would save themselves a great deal of aggravation if they moved in step with the community on this important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the opposition i wish to express our thanks to the government for the manner in which the bill has been handled in your lordships house <e> <s> on second reading it received what is popularly known as all-party support that is to say on all sides of your lordships house the speeches were strongly in favour of the bill complimentary about its purpose and complimentary also about the skill with which it had been drafted <e> <s> the compliments about drafting skill however did not extend to the committee stage because your lordships managed to devise more than amendments to table to the bill <e> <s> some of them i am glad to say were accepted by her majestys government <e> <s> unfortunately some of the better amendments were not <e> <s> needless to say most of the better amendments were tabled by her majestys opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for detailing the order in the way that she has done and for putting us so firmly in the picture regarding the inclusion of mushroom growers in this order <e> <s> we on this side of the house are in support of the order if only because it partly closes a gap in research funding for horticulture arising from reductions in government support attributable to near market research <e> <s> we understand for example that the ministry of agricultures spending will be down from million in to some million in which of course is a considerable reduction in its own right and even more so in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness spoke of the effect on prices in the long term <e> <s> does she not agree that the long term is likely to be very long indeed in view of the way in which her majestys government watered down the recommendations of the monopolies and mergers commission report on the supply of beer <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house we are grateful for the assurances which the noble baroness has given to the noble lord in her second answer to him <e> <s> we are very well aware of the difficult task the european negotiators under gatt have with the cairns group and the united states <e> <s> without prejudice to the outcome of those negotiations would not the community be in a stronger position overall if it studied some of the regimes with which it is currently apparently satisfied <e> <s> in particular will the noble baroness urge her right honourable friend the minister to ask the community whether it is not possible to have a review of for example the sugar regime which is not scheduled to take place before june and where some of the worst effects of the two-tier system are to be found <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we welcome the present stock position even though it has been reached at a heavy cost to taxpayers in general <e> <s> can he say whether physical checks of intervention stocks are now made in britain on a regular basis and with what result <e> <s> can the minister also say whether he expects better results on stock-keeping in general following the decision to establish the intervention board as an executive agency <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether her department still permits the delivery of calves by caesarian section from cows suffering from bse <e> <s> if so what is the justification for that policy in the light of present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord oliver will recognise that my remit covers animate and inanimate objects <e> <s> therefore i shall turn at once to the report on health controls and the internal market which was so excellently introduced by the noble lord lord middleton <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord stanley of alderley for introducing this important subject and for the dispassionate way in which he did so <e> <s> this is an important subject and in our view it needs to be discussed in a wider context than that provided by the agricultural

on european communities affairs criticised price proposals for the tobacco regime as recently as on both financial and health grounds <e> <s> will the noble earl ask his right honourable friend the minister to consider pressing for a review of the communitys policy on tobacco growing to take account of justified criticisms as well as suggestions that growers are not able to change to other crops

baroness for explaining in detail the order and its purpose <e> <s> i should say at once that we are in support of the order which we recognise as being desirable and necessary <e> <s> it advances considerably the ministers policy of inviting the industry to undertake the funding of what is designated as near market research <e> <s> while it is fresh in my mind i should also say that the noble lord lord carter whose absence the minister quite properly regretted told me before he departed your lordships house that i was to say on his behalf that he had been advocating just such a levy for at least years <e> <s> apparently virtue has its reward <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords on this side of the house welcome these amendments <e> <s> they both clarify and strengthen the bill <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for explaining their purpose to us <e>", "<cs> my lords we supported the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley when it was before your lordships house

sought at an earlier stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords on amendment no <e> <s> we return to the confusion that still exists in my mind concerning the application of parts but not all of the bill

similar question was asked and answered just over two weeks ago i invited the noble earl to request his right honourable friend to press for a complete review in the community of the tobacco regime to take account of both the health and financial aspects of the regime <e> <s> furthermore i suggested that it might be useful to employ biotechnology as part of the review to discover whether any alternative use could be found for these areas <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that part of the problem is that there is no alternative but to grow tobacco because of the soil and climate <e>
