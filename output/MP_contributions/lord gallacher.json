["<cs> my lords may i first join in what has now become the heedless hymn of praise to the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> one of the minor compensations of being a member of sub-committee d apart from a ringside seat when farmers disagree among themselves is that even at a ripe old age there is still a great deal to learn about the art of chairmanship and we are all indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> lord plowden for that <e> <s> the common agricultural policy is the most difficult aspect of all european community affairs and yet as has already been pointed out <e> <s> it is basic to the european community <e> <s> finn gundelach the late commissioner for agriculture said that without the cap there would not have been the free movement for manufactured goods throughout the community and without the free movement of manufactured goods there would have been no european community in the first place <e> <s> for these reasons mr gundelach said that he would fight to eliminate structural surpluses because they would destroy the cap <e> <s> this constituted a very succinct defence of the cap as such yet it is ironic that divergence of green rates and the use of monetary compensation amounts to correct these have resulted in impediments to the movements of foodstuffs throughout member states <e>"]
