["<cs> my lords i should like to join in the thanks to my noble friend lady white and to the select committee for the work that they have done on this particular directive <e> <s> i think that parliament the nation and indeed the european community ought to feel grateful for the vigilance with which they detected the important issue of principle and pursued the issue of principle beneath what on the surface is an extremely technical and complex directive <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in this debate i join in the warm congratulations to the noble lord lord annan for initiating this important debate and in the congratulations to the right reverend prelate the bishop of blackburn for a splendid and persuasive maiden speech <e> <s> like my noble friend lord barnett to whose speech i listened with great pleasure i have to begin with a declaration of interest as chairman of the independent broadcasting authority <e> <s> in fact this is the first time i have addressed your lordships house since i became chairman <e> <s> there is a proper inhibition i believe on a chairman of a broadcasting authority who has the good fortune to a member of this house from joining in its debates when he may subsequently have to adjudicate on the way the issues in these debates are covered by the broadcasters for whom he is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest as an independent director of the royal bank of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to concentrate my remarks on the proposals in the gracious speech for a major broadcasting bill <e> <s> my noble friends will cover the other aspects of the debate which was opened so comprehensively by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> we are promised that it will be a massive bill proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord cledwyn in his expression of thanks to the noble lord lord home for initiating this important debate <e> <s> i join with both of them in the tributes to lord stewart of fulham michael stewart <e> <s> i was proud to have served as his deputy for a number of years <e> <s> he made a very distinctive and fine contribution to international affairs in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords my immediate pleasant duty is warmly to congratulate the noble earl lord lindsay on an extremely effective maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl clearly speaks as an expert in the matters that he has chosen for his maiden speech <e> <s> i know that he has already served with distinction in his chosen profession <e> <s> i know too that the whole house it is a rare privilege for someone to be aware that he speaks for the whole house will look forward to the many future occasions upon which we shall listen to the noble earls contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble baroness lady birk in paying tribute to the good humoured as well as very clear way in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to follow the noble lord lord clinton-davis and to have listened to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord richard <e> <s> however i am conscious that i am the fourth former member of the european commission to address the house in this debate and although kindly remarks have been made about us i fear that i may be beginning to strain the general tolerance of the house <e>", "<cs> i apologise for my absence at the start of the committee stage <e> <s> i had a long-standing and unavoidable commitment in scotland from which i have just returned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords intervention and for the fact that he is ready to look further at this amendment <e> <s> i appreciate his anxiety that the hands of the itc should not be tied <e> <s> the itc appreciate that particular argument <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to support the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate for two reasons <e> <s> first i should like to say something about the work that has gone on over the years in the central religious advisory committee from my own experience when i was chairman of the iba <e> <s> more importantly i should like to apply my mind to the problems that will face the successor organisation the itc in the field of religious broadcasting <e>", "<cs> i feel torn between the noble lord lord willis and the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> however as my name is on the amendment i am of course on the side of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am most indebted to the noble lord for that response <e> <s> i had not reached amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list <e> <s> in the light of the ministers assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is on the final point that the minister makes that the dispute between us lies <e> <s> we are grateful to him for setting out the rather complex set of arrangements which the government propose both in the bill and in subordinate legislation to seek to prevent an undue concentration of ownership <e> <s> so far so good <e> <s> however we strongly dissent from the ministers claim that if a major television contractor owns a minor regional contractor better regional television will result <e>", "<cs> in this amendment i concentrate on the principle of single ownership for regional contracts within the terrestrial commercial television system <e> <s> i confess that i had not taken on board the point that the minister made <e> <s> if he would concede the main point that i am seeking with the amendment we should be only too happy to have the government draft it in such a way that it does not spill over into other areas in which we would want to make a separate judgment <e>", "<cs> i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> before we come to a conclusion on the matter perhaps i may make two comments on what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> he made a noble attempt to provide a logical basis for the governments policy <e> <s> however it seemed to me that there was a fundamental flaw in his logic <e> <s> he argued that there could be one rule for non-domestic satellite services and another for domestic satellite services on the basis that they were not comparable <e> <s> we were wrong on our side we were trying to compare like with like when they are not alike <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord wyatt mentioned me by name perhaps i may take this opportunity to comment on his amendments <e> <s> like the noble lord lord barnett i have known enjoyed and endured the noble lord lord wyatt over nearly years <e> <s> again like the noble lord lord barnett i pay tribute to him as the ideal apostle in your lordships house of the doctrine of due impartiality <e>", "<cs> i support what the right reverend prelate has said <e> <s> i prefer the second alternative amendment <e> <s> the clause contains an important provision prohibiting any advertisement which is wholly or mainly of a political nature <e> <s> i have always regarded the prohibition on political advertising in this country as one of the great safeguards of democracy <e> <s> political advocacy must be carried out by way of programmes and not by raising funds for the <e>", "<cs> i share the views expressed by the noble earl <e> <s> the noble baroness has given a great deal of study to the matter and her report a year or two ago was notable <e> <s> undoubtedly there is a real social problem of alcoholism in our society <e> <s> however the best way to deal with it in terms of television advertising is through the advertising codes <e> <s> they are already carefully drawn up for newspaper advertising and especially for television advertising with a great many restrictions <e> <s> the noble baroness drew attention to one that through voluntary arrangements spirits are not advertised <e>", "<cs> we on these benches agree both with the minister and with the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> we believe that the proposals for this termination fine are altogether better than the original proposal for a performance bond <e> <s> therefore i shall not waste the time of the committee by delving into the details of the matter <e> <s> i have one question to ask <e> <s> where will the money from the fines go <e> <s> i believe that it was originally proposed in relation to the performance bonds that such money ought to go into the consolidated fund <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed by the ministers last response though i am not surprised by it <e> <s> perhaps i may give notice that we may wish to return to this point on report <e>", "<cs> i join the noble baroness lady birk in supporting the amendment and i shall speak to the associated amendments <e> <s> the new clause stands in our names amendment no <e> <s> deals with the levy <e> <s> i ought to give notice even though it is on the marshalled list that to be consistent with the proposals we put forward we have in mind speaking against clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> we shall reach that stage later tonight <e>", "<cs> even under the governments system quality will continue to be paid for in the way in which commercial television has always been sustained in this country namely through selling advertising time <e> <s> i do not believe that will change under the bill <e> <s> however what will change are the grounds on which the commission which is chosen by the government will select licensees <e> <s> if one selects licensees on the basis of the highest monetary bid with the best will in the world and with the greatest good faith in the world people who bid for a <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily but i wish to follow up one or two points from the noble earls speech and endorse what the noble baroness just said <e> <s> there is evidence of the risks when one allows money rather than judgment about quality to determine decisions on the shape of broadcasting <e> <s> australia is a prime illustration <e> <s> it is true that the situation in australia is different in a number of ways from that in this country <e> <s> nevertheless australia let money have its head and paid a bitter price in terms of the quality of australian broadcasting <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for those comments <e> <s> he is right in thinking that the major amendment is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we on this side of the committee welcome the amendment and appreciate that the undertaking given originally in another place has been fulfilled <e> <s> the noble baroness and i are content with that and agree that it covers the matters set out in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is the major matter <e>", "<cs> i wish strongly to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> this situation could apply to a number of different regions in the system apart from wales and the west <e> <s> for example i live in a dual region where the present contractor is tvs of which the chairman is the noble lord lord boston <e> <s> the service provided in that dual region is extremely important for the eastern part of kent <e> <s> it would be important in the public interest that with such a dual region the regional service is sustained programmes are made and studio facilities and other facilities are kept within the region <e> <s> as one of the main thrusts of the bill which the government have accepted throughout is to try to reinforce the regional identity and the characteristics of the system i hope the government will look sympathetically at this amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has made a most important announcement for the first time namely to tell the chamber that the iba may now be considering redrawing the map on the grounds that perhaps one or two of the areas as the minister put it might be marginally viable <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that last week in committee the view from this bench was that on the whole the iba considered the existing map likely to be one which they wished to stand by <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the minister for the explanation of this series of amendments dealing with revocation <e> <s> at this time of night i have little to say about them <e> <s> it is clear and fair as the minister has proposed that if there is a revocation between the grant and award of the licence one should carry on and offer it to the next highest bidder and not go through the whole auction process again <e> <s> however if the revocation occurs after the award or the start of the service do the government intend that the auction procedure should be repeated <e>", "<cs> at an early stage in our discussions today i gave notice that in due course we would oppose this clause in principle <e> <s> even as a natural pessimist i did not foresee that it would be quite as late as it is now <e> <s> therefore i shall not weary the committee by going over the arguments put by the noble baroness lady birk so thoroughly and so necessarily but it is important even at this hour to put on record our fundamental objections to the methods used in the bill <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down will he be kind enough to tell me to what he is referring when he says the second new clause <e> <s> it may be that i am beginning to flag a little but can be clarify that he is referring to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i confess that i did not know that that was what i was aiming for <e> <s> i must catch up on the detail <e> <s> i shall therefore concentrate on the ministers reply as regards amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as this appears to be a bill in which bidding is very much at the heart of the matter i am bound to concede that in this case he has out-bid me <e> <s> i asked for a three-year report but he has offered me an annual report <e> <s> i can only express my thanks to him and add the cautionary note that i shall wait to study the amendment which he brings forward to see how far it satisfies us <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the four-year proposal is generous <e> <s> there is a -year contract and after six years the company can apply to have it renewed <e> <s> that seems to me to be an extraordinarily short time to put the licence holder to the test <e> <s> therefore i strongly support the idea of two years as proposed by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> that is correct <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support amendment no <e> <s> a and the associated amendments tabled by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> like her i warmly welcome the fact that the government have moved an amendment proposing a moratorium <e> <s> it has taken a long time and a great deal of argument in this place and another place to bring the government to the view that it is a common sense modification of their free market ideology <e> <s> however better late than never <e> <s> it is a sensible change <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the msinisters explanation of this change but i am bound to say that i remain unconvinced by the arguments that he adduced <e> <s> it is true that the bill changes the status of channel which now becomes a separate channel corporation where previously nominally at least it was a wholly owned subsidiary of the iba <e>", "<cs> before the committee approves the amendments and clause it ought to be aware of exactly what the government are proposing with this device <e> <s> it is a very curious proposition to which i believe not enough attention has been given during the debates on the bill <e>", "<cs> the minister gave an inadequate reply to the proposal put forward by the noble baroness lady birk that there should be serious study <e> <s> he says that a study has been carried out by the dti <e> <s> from my experience the dti tends to rush into such matters with great ideas but without exploring them in depth <e> <s> i remember a famous occasion on which it suddenly called the chairmen of the bbc and iba to this building in order to try to persuade us to transfer channel and bbc to satellite <e> <s> the idea was shot down in about days as being technologically foolish <e> <s> the more comment that has been made on the proposals for channel the more one is glad that the ultimate responsibility for broadcasting policy will remain with the home office <e>", "<cs> it is a real compliment <e>", "<cs> the remit which the minister just described is acceptable so far as it goes but it is very basic <e> <s> my noble friend baroness birk has performed a notable service in tabling these new clauses <e> <s> they will enable the committee to begin to <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will be glad to know that for once i am persuaded by his arguments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendinent <e>", "<cs> i am becoming positively worried because i think that the noble earl is right in his arguments <e> <s> if in fact we divided the clock different considerations would apply to different times <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot speak with the same experience or knowledge as the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and the other speakers who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> however i should like to add my voice in support of the amendment <e> <s> i do so against this background <e> <s> ten or years ago there was very little provision on television for those who were hard of hearing <e> <s> but since that time steady and good progress has been made <e> <s> the iba took a leading part both through its technologists and through the research work which it financed at southampton university <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate these benches with what the noble baroness lady birk has just said about the governments new clause <e> <s> this is one more case where we welcome the fact that the government recognised that some new provision was required in the bill and have moved <e> <s> but our welcome is a qualified one as the noble baroness said <e> <s> we hope that it may be possible to make further progress either tonight or by report stage certainly <e> <s> the positive achievement it is a notable and major achievement to which i pay due tribute is that we now have the words networking arrangements in the bill and they will be in statute <e> <s> that is a notable step forward <e>", "<cs> we all agree with the noble earl that these are difficult matters on which it is impossible to come to a final conclusion tonight <e> <s> the noble earl referred to todays statement from the iba <e> <s> i was glad that he quoted the part which showed how far the present companies have gone in producing a scheme for the iba that could provide an agreed basis for the network <e> <s> i noticed that in the statement the iba said that developments have occurred in the past few days <e> <s> some are provisional and will need further detailed consideration before the issues are in all cases clear <e> <s> in the light of that we are in a transitional state <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will agree that we should not finalise the amendment and the amendments to the amendment tonight <e> <s> will he give an assurance that we will come back to these matters in a more final form at report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may pursue this matter for a moment with the noble viscount <e> <s> her majestys government are a signatory to those european conventions <e> <s> they have a spirit as well as a letter <e> <s> are the government saying that they will use the opportunity to deal with this matter administratively simply by turning a blind eye to whatever happens <e>", "<cs> i was not arguing in support of the amendment going into the present bill <e> <s> but i was rather shocked by what i thought might be the implication of what the minister was saying that nondomestic satellites will be treated extremely leniently to put it mildly in terms of the spirit of the european directive which the government have signed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister comments i should like to associate these benches with the protests that have just been made <e> <s> there are nearly pages of new amendments <e> <s> they are extremely technical amendments <e> <s> apart from the grave discourtesy to the house and the great inconvenience to members from all sides some of these amendments must affect the interests of outside parties who have had no opportunity to examine them properly and make representations so that the debates might reflect their interests <e> <s> it is a very unhappy situation indeed <e>", "<cs> i throw down my notes in deference to the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> i am sure that those of us who have laboured long and late on this bill are very glad to welcome her to these proceedings <e> <s> i hope that she will stay and take part in the debates <e>", "<cs> i fully follow the governments reasoning and i am not surprised by what the minister said <e> <s> however the government are missing a great opportunity with the new broadcasting bill to take a fresh look at the cable situation <e> <s> i teased the noble earl sitting on the government bench a little about the fact that the enterprise economy and cable had to await american enterprise coming in <e> <s> nevertheless it has come in <e> <s> cable is said to be on the move <e> <s> the chairman of the cable authority told me the other day that he was happy now that he is about to give up office towards the end of the year that he will leave two-thirds of the households in britain i think he said within reach of franchises that have been awarded to licensees <e> <s> whether the transmitters will be erected and at what pace is of course another matter <e>", "<cs> i can see that i shall not move the government any further on this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord care to expand on the rationale behind having two classes of cable operator <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady birk that it is otiose to go over the arguments that we have already had on the principle <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am greatly indebted to the noble earl <e> <s> there is no more to say <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> far from cheering me up the noble earl has depressed me more than at any other point in our debates by his easy dismissal of the insertion of the word quality here <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put a proposition to the minister <e> <s> i do so in a helpful spirit <e> <s> is there not a distinction to be drawn in terms of our overall responsibility for the new radio regime between the three national services and perhaps some hundreds of local services <e> <s> as a compromise will the minister think about accepting the word quality for national services while leaving it to <e>", "<cs> i was concentrating on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for the consideration that he has given to the amendment but i cannot express myself as satisfied with what he said <e> <s> it would be wrong to regard moray firth radio as a special case <e> <s> it happens to be the case that i know best and that is why i used it <e> <s> it is perhaps an extreme case of the old system <e> <s> those who run the station are rather sensitive about it being regarded as a lame duck or something like that <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble earl for that response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am surprised to hear what the minister has said and to hear that the provision is at the request of the new radio authority <e> <s> we have just had an argument about various familiar phrases such as taste and decency incitement to disorder and offensive to public feeling <e> <s> the government have insisted on retaining those phrases as being necessary to sustain standards <e> <s> how on earth can a government who say that almost in the next breath take away the duty to carry out research into the effects of programmes on listeners <e> <s> the effect of broadcasting is a fundamental issue particularly as <e>", "<cs> can the minister say where in the bill we shall find the provision relating to the national radio services <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i would not call it a clarification for me it amounted to further confusion <e> <s> the proposed amendment is perfectly clear but we object to it <e> <s> it appears to remove from the duty of the authority the need to make arrangements for ascertaining the effects of programmes on the attitudes or behaviour of the listeners <e> <s> it says nothing about the duty being confined to additional services it is a blanket provision that appears to apply to the whole of the output <e> <s> it would be extraordinary if as regards the new national radio services there was no proper audience research <e> <s> however i believe that i carry the government with me when i say that with community radio we are entering into the unknown good and important territory of ethnic community radio <e> <s> it is extremely important for society as a whole that we should know the effect of these new community ethnic stations on feeling and attitudes in the ethnic community <e> <s> it seems to me astonishing that that should be removed by this amendment <e>", "<cs> would it not be better to reconsider the matter <e> <s> we accept what the minister says is his interpretation of the amendment but it is not that interpretation which matters once this bill reaches the statute book <e> <s> it is what the statute says which is important <e> <s> there is some confusion on the matter <e>", "<cs> it is a matter of degree as to how far the radio authority should be expected to go in setting out the formula for the various channels <e> <s> clearly we differ across the floor of the committee on how far one should go <e> <s> nevertheless we are grateful to the noble earl for giving such a closely argued response to our proposals <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely puzzled by the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> as we keep repeating the heart of the bill is a bidding system <e> <s> we sought to modify that bidding system with a reference to exceptional circumstances and the government went along with that desire in the case of television contracts <e> <s> we were very happy about that even though they did not go so far as we wished <e>", "<cs> i am provoked to speak because the answers that the minister has given remind me of a gentleman whom i knew in the independent local radio sector <e> <s> he complained bitterly <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i ask my questions at the same time so that the noble viscount can then reply <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his explanations of these complicated matters <e> <s> although they are technical there are behind the technicalities some significant issues of policy <e> <s> the noble viscount referred to the disposal of the uplink to bsb as part of these changes <e> <s> i think i am probably right in saying that as part of the original contractual arrangements under which bsb was given the dbs contract by the iba it was bsb that paid for the uplink <e> <s> that must be taken into account and is perhaps the background to the nominal figure which the minister mentioned <e>", "<cs> the method of privatising one half of the public broadcasting transmission system of this country is something about which parliament is entitled to know a good deal more before the bill finally becomes an act <e>", "<cs> clause is the first of the clauses dealing with the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> we have given notice of our intention to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> this may be a convenient moment at the beginning of this group of clauses to state our anxieties regarding the broadcasting standards council <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mcgregor <e> <s> i have had considerable experience over a number of years of the workings of advertising control in this country <e> <s> i deliberately did not raise this matter when i spoke earlier on the general role of the bsc <e> <s> that has been determined by the committee <e> <s> i echo the words of my noble friend lord boston of faversham <e> <s> with the bsc now in the bill to accept the arguments put so persuasively by my noble friends would be a practical improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down has he considered clause which states <e>", "<cs> with respect that is exactly the point that we are seeking to make to the noble earl <e> <s> he knows as well as anyone else in public life knows that once you provide a facility for making complaints people make complaints <e> <s> they are often not very wise or well-founded complaints but the people do not believe that <e> <s> under clause however ill-founded a complaint may be it shall be the statutory duty of the broadcasting standards council to investigate it and to make findings <e> <s> that will cut right across the work of the well-established extremely efficient advertising control in this country <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to persist but until now there has always been an easy distinction drawn in commercial television between programmes and broadcasting <e> <s> i am not arguing against the broadcasting standards council dealing with complaints against programmes <e> <s> it is totally unnecessary for it to get into the business of dealing with complaints about advertising <e> <s> it is an easy matter to set clear in the statute <e> <s> i do not understand the governments stubbornness on the matter <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> in doing so i stress that i differ a little from my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i shall not repeat the arguments that have been used but my noble friend lord aylestone has said something about the history of the matter which is also my starting point because of my past association with the iba <e>", "<cs> if i am seeking any divine right it is not the divine right of kings it is the divine right of the people <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask a question before the noble earl sits down <e> <s> he is right to remind us of the provisions under the act because we are inclined to forget them <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will not be surprised to hear that i found his reply deeply disappointing <e> <s> we on this side of the committee accept the fact that those who own sporting rights have a property for which they are entitled to obtain the best possible price <e> <s> we also accept that the revenue received by some companies which own sporting rights goes back to the grass roots and helps to promote sport in this country <e>", "<cs> we on these benches welcome the new clause and strongly support the amendments to it <e> <s> i do not understand why channel is not included in the new clause <e> <s> its contribution to the character of british television since it was founded is exactly of the nature that would provide some excellent archive material <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl lord ferrers for his generous words <e> <s> i join with the noble baroness lady birk in thanking him for the very good natured and good humoured way in which he has conducted the proceedings <e> <s> it is years since i last took part in the committee stage of a bill in another place <e> <s> it has been a fascinating introduction to the procedures of this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl responds i should like to associate these benches strongly with the protest made by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> we now have before us a revised and massive marshalled list amounting to amendments and although a number of them are technical there are some extremely important new <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are a response by the government to a point which i raised in committee <e> <s> i am indebted to the government for carrying this through in respect of the television side of things <e> <s> i thank them very much <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies perhaps i may raise an associated point <e> <s> this is a difficult area with a good deal of ambiguity <e> <s> i do not profess to understand it fully but i understand from the shadow itc that it is concerned that the wording of the government amendment is not yet quite appropriate to the tasks that it will have to undertake and that dialogue is continuing between the noble earls department and the itc <e> <s> i was asked to raise with the noble earl whether he might have another look at the matter before a final decision of the house is taken in terms of the text in the bill <e> <s> i think that that point coincides with the concerns of the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> it is a difficult area and it is important to get the drafting as correct as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i must assure the noble lord who has just spoken that we are not trying to score a point here <e> <s> we are searching together for the best form of words in an area of some importance to the responsibilities of the future itc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that assurance and am content with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate these benches with the points made by the noble baroness and the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> with regard to non-ec ownership there is a very important principle involved <e> <s> i am afraid it is sadly true of the history of independent local radio in this country that native enterprise has not always shown itself to be notably successful <e> <s> at various stages in the past it was first american ownership and later australian ownership that provided a good deal of the enterprise for the development of independent local radio <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful for the explanation given by the noble earl <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of the noble baroness lady birk was tabled to make certain beyond peradventure that once the present contracts have been allocated and if difficulties arise we should be certain that in the subordinate legislation the necessary arrangements would be made to prevent excessive ownership in terms of scale and to prevent contiguity taking place except in the special circumstances described by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the explanation that the noble earl has given i do not believe that there is anything between the two sides of the house <e> <s> there is a shared common concern and i am content with the assurances that have been given <e> <s> i shall not pursue my proposed amendment no <e> <s> to amend amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will

amendment <e> <s> it goes to the heart of the question of the balance of quality and price <e> <s> at present the government have felt able to go only as far as saying that in exceptional circumstances quality can take primacy over price <e> <s> we suggest that if the word particular is substituted that would enable the itc on a more general plane to give quality primacy over price <e>", "<cs> my lords the house always listens with the greatest respect and affection to the noble viscount who has just spoken not least on matters of broadcasting policy <e> <s> his wisdom on the relations between government and broadcasters is profound and ought to be noted <e> <s> i regard the noble viscount as one of the great founding fathers of one of the most innovative elements in british broadcasting the controversial channel <e> <s> i have always commended to other ministers his description of watching some of the first controversial programmes on that new channel which he founded <e> <s> he described how he sat in his armchair at home beside the fire i hope with a modest glass beside him and started watching the controversial programmes until he found that he had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i speak for the crowded benches behind me in my contribution but i wish to offer a few words of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that explanation and agree with a good deal of the argument that he has put <e> <s> as regards value for money one can be optimistic about the possibility of the non-metropolitan regions doing well in terms of making programmes and enabling them to be available to the regions <e> <s> the truth is that purely on money grounds it is generally a good deal cheaper to produce programmes let us say in scotland or the north- east of england than it is in the london area <e> <s> the difficulty is a non-economic one that the london area attracts as a magnet those who are involved in television and film production <e> <s> unless there is a positive pressure the other way that process carries on <e> <s> even though it is more expensive down in the metropolitan area it is done there because the people have gathered there they meet in the same professional meeting places and an old boy network grows up that outweighs the forces of the economic costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has no reason to apologise to the house for the way in which he presented the amendments <e> <s> they are highly technical and difficult to comprehend but it is very important that the government put their position on the record because the networking arrangements are of great significance <e> <s> they have been a constant problem within the commercial television system over many years <e>", "<cs> my lords they did not appear to be grouped together and i therefore avoided referring to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble earl and am reassured by what he said <e> <s> as he implied if things go wrong at some time in the future in order to maintain an effective network service i am anxious to see a reserve power available to the itc <e> <s> i agree that it is much better if the companies can make their own arrangements by agreement but i should like to feel sure and perhaps the noble earl could tell me this in due course although not necessarily this evening that there would be such a reserve right to act by the itc if things went wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly happy with that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although these are technical amendments they are nevertheless of great significance <e> <s> therefore it may be convenient if i were to comment at this stage on what the noble earl has just said rather than deal with amendment no <e> <s> which is tabled in my name <e> <s> perhaps i may then be able to move my amendment formally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in all the circumstances i am grateful to the noble earl for such a forthcoming response <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is absolutely right to say that television is a very powerful medium but when he goes on from that to say that the issue before your lordships house today is how parliament should regulate the content of television programmes i think he is mistaken in putting it in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this amendment perhaps i may ask the noble earl to expand a little on it <e> <s> it is true that an advertising agent is totally prohibited from owning a television contract <e> <s> is there any reason why the words about the television contractor being an advertising agent are to be omitted <e> <s> he might perhaps advertise his own programmes or that kind of activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for spotting the misprint which i came across this morning relating to the interpretation of the clause <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for his clarification <e> <s> it means that the position of an <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not wish to take up the time of the house on a matter on which i had already spoken <e> <s> however i now realise that other noble lords wish to speak on it so perhaps i may formally move the amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl concludes even at this late stage of the bill is there any possibility that the government will consider an alternative way to deal with what the noble earl has conceded is a problem although this amendment may not be the best way to deal with it <e> <s> satellite broadcasters whether it is bsb or sky channel are engaged with vast investment in a high risk operation <e> <s> we have a legitimate interest to ensure the proper safeguarding of their encoding and encryption systems <e> <s> will it still be possible to write some additional safeguard into the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like immediately to thank the noble earl for his characteristically kind personal words <e> <s> i join the noble baroness in paying tribute to all those inside the house and behind the scenes the staff of the house and our personal staffs who have contributed to the passage of this long and important bill <e> <s> i know that all noble lords would like to pay a special tribute to the noble earl himself <e> <s> as i understand it he has taken on a subject that was not directly his own inside his department <e> <s> it is a difficult complex and technical subject <e> <s> it has been a marathon bill and yet we have had from him constant courtesy and good temper <e> <s> we have had not only good humour but some wit as well which has leavened our proceedings so frequently <e> <s> he has never lost his cool in the face of criticism and some of our criticism has been fundamental and some of it quite fierce <e> <s> we appreciate his good humour <e>", "<cs> my lords gamekeeper or poacher i do not wish to go over the ground that has been so ably covered by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> it is difficult to say anything new on the substance of these important amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that what he has just said raises very serious issues indeed <e> <s> does he not recognise that the prime minister was informed of this impending merger with all its implications while the broadcasting bill was still before parliament <e> <s> had parliament been aware of this and not been kept in deliberate ignorance the decisions that we took might well have been different <e> <s> is it not too serious a matter to be dealt with simply by question and answer across the floor of the house <e> <s> should not the government make time available for the matter to he debated properly <e>"]
