["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that detailed answer <e> <s> nevertheless as one who myself is a supporter of the first-past-the-post system may i ask whether he agrees that as something approaching one-third of the parliamentary constituencies in england scotland and wales are either substantially or in many cases grossly under- or over-represented and have been for some time this has only the gravest implications for the health of the first-past-the-post system <e> <s> furthermore while appreciating what my noble friend said about how the boundary commissions are getting on may i ask him whether he agrees that it is a fact that the boundary commissions are not renowned for their speed and will he and his right honourable friend in another place do all they possibly can to see to it that they are galvanised into action so that their reports are received in plenty of time and implemented before the next general election which i sincerely trust will be taking place some time around <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for repeating the statement i wonder whether i might ask him three questions <e> <s> first are not the government being strangely inconsistent in that having opposed devolution in scotland and wales they are now trying to impose some form of probably unworkable devolution in northern ireland <e> <s> secondly am i not right in thinking that ulster representation at westminster is to be increased from to quite rightly so as to reach parity with the united kingdom as a whole and is there not really some danger that these proposals are going to rekindle scottish nationalism <e> <s> lastly and most important why do the government not feel that the best way to heal the divisions between the two communities is by integrating northern ireland more closely within the much wider and i should have thought much safer context of the united kingdom as a whole rather than trying to set up a complicated assembly or parliament which will inevitably act as a focal point for suspicion bitterness and rivalries as among the various factions <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that national ratepayers associations up and down the country and certainly one with which i am closely connected utterly condemn this action and consider as a matter of principle that it is utterly wrong for councils to use money for this purpose because it does not directly assist the ratepayers indeed to the contrary it means an added burden to the rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to join in congratulating the noble lord lord hunt of tan-worth on his very distinguished contribution <e> <s> i wish also to express sympathy to my noble friend lord elton and his colleagues for the monumental task confronting them in so far as this paper and its proposals arc concerned and express our thanks for their arduous labours in northern ireland as a whole particularly in respect of the most urgent task of combating terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that rather satisfactory answer may i ask that if consideration of the european boundary constituencies has not been completed simultaneously with the westminster constituencies will legislation be introduced so that the commission may submit its recommendations on the westminster constituencies without delay <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that there could be disastrous consequences for our electoral system if by the next general election the existing boundaries are not changed because there are scandalous discrepancies between the size of electorates in different constituencies at present as has been highlighted by the four by-elections which have taken place during this parliament one in a constituency of some electors and another of <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord monson <e>", "<cs> he and i agree on so many things that i think noble friend is hardly out of order <e> <s> but i support the noble lord lord monson because this clause has very considerable merit <e> <s> it is in no way an answer to the rating problem but it is at least an interim measure an additional safeguard for hard-pressed ratepayers on whose behalf i feel strongly because i happen to be president of the national union of ratepayers associations which <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might briefly intervene because this amendment is also in my name as well as that of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> it is of course very similar to the one which was proposed in committee <e> <s> that came up very late at night after midnight whereas this time it has come up at the fairly sprightly hour of half-past nine <e> <s> so possibly one may be able to say a few words without rather intimidating frowns from one or two members of the front bench such as one received on that occasion if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i too feel greatly indebted to my noble friend lord renton for initiating this debate and providing an opportunity to take part in it <e> <s> i think all noble lords are grateful to the noble lord lord scanlon for finding the time to come and give such a valuable contribution from his wealth of experience in the trade union world <e> <s> he perhaps will not mind if i say to him that i may need a series of educational lectures before i go all the way with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that observation and i appreciate that there is a great deal in what he says <e> <s> there is perhaps a difficulty in that although as he rightly said in the debate last week there was not a specific commitment in the conservative manifesto to do away with the closed shop it is rather taking refuge in the small print not to do so because although that is true it is also true that the impression was strongly fostered at the last general election that the conservative party were going seriously to tackle this and indeed other issues <e> <s> i feel that my noble friend the minister is rather kidding himself if he does not realise that there is great anger and dismay expressed in many quarters of the electorate that so little has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords on the nine oclock news on bbc on th may at least four minutes was devoted to the coverage of the voluntary suicide of the terrorist hughes including a nauseatingly deferential interview with his brother who naturally enough took the opportunity to refer to the murderess thatcher <e> <s> this was repeated at considerably greater length on bbc s newsnight <e> <s> perhaps about one minute of coverage was given to the tragic death of the -year-old boy who was killed as the result of republican rioting and whose father died only yesterday <e> <s> does the noble lord therefore not agree that the whole priority of news items the whole emphasis and concern on the part of the bbc always seems orientated towards the ira rather than their victims <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed little doubt that the problems of the rating system are one of the top issues of the day and i too am much indebted to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for giving us the opportunity to debate this important subject <e> <s> after listening to the speakers before me i am rather reminded that the other day someone said that there are about as many schemes for reforming the rating system as there are for reforming your lordships house <e> <s> if that is the case perhaps it does not augur very well for reform of the rating system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply would he confirm that the cost of publishing the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the sum of a quarter of a million pounds of ratepayers money has in fact been allocated by the glc for political advertisements such as the one referred to by my noble friend lord belhaven in several newspapers including the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord moyola although perhaps somewhat intimidating to find myself speaking among such a formidable array of distinguished speakers from ulster no less than two prime ministers and the son of another distinguished prime minister <e> <s> it is with great regret as a supporter of the government on about every conceivable issue that i cannot bring myself to support this bill which i look upon as dangerous showing inconsistency and an irrelevance to northern irelands present needs <e>", "<cs> i realise that your lordships wish fairly soon to hear two important statements but perhaps the committee will bear with me if i say a few words in thanking noble lords who have taken part in the debate on the amendment <e> <s> i was very interested in the remarks of my noble friend lord brookeborough who speaks with very great experience his recollections of local government in northern ireland were most interesting <e> <s> i should like to say more but what i find extraordinary is that my noble friend lord gowrie calls this a direct rule improvement bill <e> <s> surely my amendment would merely improve the situation <e> <s> he said that my proposal in the amendment was a diversion <e> <s> i would call it a preliminary step an additional option <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend rises may i say that the whole point of having a referendum is that it will be held not before the assembly elections but possibly a couple of years afterwards <e> <s> when the assembly elections are held the question of devolution proposals will not be uppermost in the minds of northern ireland electors <e> <s> it is only a year or two later when concrete devolution proposals are being put forward that that will be the case <e> <s> that is why there should surely be a chance for the northern ireland electorate to express their opinion at the time when devolution proposals are forthcoming <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord gowrie has said once or twice that he does not expect any devolution proposals for a long time <e> <s> obviously he has no idea of how long <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go back to the last amendment but a lot of these flowery provisions would be quite unnecessary if only a referendum was to take place <e> <s> if one has a referendum then one can quite easily gauge cross-community support by breaking down and monitoring various parts and regions of northern ireland <e> <s> that is what was done at the time of the scottish referendum when there was a breakdown of such places as the lothian region grampian strathclyde and so on <e> <s> in a referendum it would be perfectly easy to see whether or not cross-community support was forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make a very brief intervention which i trust will not be a second reading speech <e> <s> i too should like to thank my noble friend lord gowrie for replying so fully and carefully and with such patience to the many points made <e> <s> i must apologise to him that i was unavoidably called out of the chamber when he was speaking a few moments ago and i hope i have not missed anything of very great importance <e> <s> i can only hope that if this experiment is not seen to be producing worthwhile results over a reasonable period and if the assembly is seen to be degenerating into a sort of talking shop then the government are not going to fool around and the assembly will be wound up decisively and not allowed to drag on <e> <s> obviously political uncertainty and hesitation in northern ireland will hinder the fight against terrorism and hinder investment <e> <s> i have a feeling that those who directly rule in northern ireland could yet be surprised by the reaction of those who are directly ruled <e> <s> by this i mean that when the full implications of future devolution are made clear and i know that this is not a devolution bill but devolution is going to come if the act progresses and the risks involved are more generally realised it might be that direct rule which i think everybody agrees is everybodys second choice at the moment might become everybodys first choice <e> <s> that might turn out to include the majority of both sections of the community <e> <s> it will need to be a rather more positive form of direct rule eventually with more local democracy more imagination and more commitment on the part of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for my noble friend to ascertain the attitude of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and leading supporters of cnd to the dropping of atom bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in and whether they would as presumably they would have been prepared to sacrifice the lives of a million allied troops and of perhaps three or five million japanese before the japanese surrendered <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that the question of the noble lord lord hylton highlights the irrelevance of the northern ireland assembly which less than two-thirds of its members attend <e> <s> some of them have boycotted the assembly almost permanently and i believe that the assembly costs about million annually <e> <s> does not my noble friend the leader of the house think that the time has come for this rather pointless assembly to be wound up so that the money time and effort involved in it could be better spent in combating terrorism and ensuring greater prison security which must be the governments prime objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the noble lord lord bottomley on what was an excellent maiden speech by any standard and to say after such a long and distinguished career in another place how glad we are to have him in your lordships house <e> <s> i fear that in some quarters hearts may sink as to what i am going to say <e> <s> but no matter what my noble friend lord bellwin and other ministers may say in attempted explanation of the governments failure to implement the conservative election promise to abolish the rates its postponement or suspension if not withdrawal of it in and finally saying in that domestic rates must continue for the foreseeable future hundreds of thousands of domestic ratepayers believe that they have been very sadly misled and let down by her majestys government <e> <s> i regret to say this on the evidence of information reaching the offices of the national union of ratepayers associations and its vice-chairmen in many parts of england and wales <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment because it is most unfortunate that there is no reference let alone a commitment in the bill to an urgent reform of the rating system <e> <s> this is a cross-party amendment that i would have thought should command widespread if not universal support <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk in moving it should it be accepted will have done her majestys government a considerable service <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord bellwin and his ministerial colleagues have perhaps got over their somewhat defeatist attitude towards the issue of rating reform <e> <s> i hope also that my noble friend will be able to give some rather more positive indication of government thinking <e> <s> my noble friend has already been reminded that he quoted the secretary of state who recently said that work was going on quite urgently behind the scenes <e> <s> it certainly seems to be a case that if at first you dont succeed then you must try try and try again <e>", "<cs> my lords as the liberal and alliance parties seem to think that proportional representation is such a marvellous idea can not my noble friend elicit any information from them as to why lloyd george and the liberals did not introduce it during the many years they were in power earlier this century <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> does he agree that it is all the more impressive bearing in mind that corby has suffered from the loss of several thousand jobs as a result of the british steel closure some years ago as announced under the last labour government <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend what government measures have been and are being taken and what other organisations and various bodies such as the corby industrial development centre are helping corby with a considerable degree of success particularly at a time when the national trend is adverse <e> <s> is my noble friend satisfied that the experience drawn at corby is being applied with the same vigour in other areas which are suffering from economic hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords the two noble lords immediately before me on the list of speakers have not quite made the course which is certainly a reminder to me to be brief and at least i think i can be confident that i shall finish my speech today and not run on until tomorrow <e> <s> it is a sobering thought but i think it is true that if only successive governments and especially the present one had not fought shy of reforming the rating system and tackling the roots of the problem in local government we might not now be discussing this bill into what will be the early hours of tomorrow morning <e> <s> it is of course a very time-consuming controversial business and i fear that basically it fails to get to the heart of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my most pleasant task and honour to be the first from these benches to welcome and congratulate my noble friend lord vinson <e> <s> if i may say so he made an outstanding and most stimulating speech speaking from great experience as i believe the chairman of the development commission and therefore especially well qualified to speak in this debate <e> <s> i know he said that he was an inventor <e> <s> i do not know what new innovations he may bring to your lordships house but at any rate i know that noble lords from all sides of the house hope that he will frequently be making contributions to our proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that illuminating answer <e> <s> does it not show that the counties which suffered the highest rises appear to be labour-controlled and those with the smallest rises are under conservative control <e> <s> does this not show that the high-spending and extravagance of labour councils is by no means confined to the big cities <e> <s> surely this has implications as to which way ratepayers should vote in the forthcoming shire elections <e>", "<cs> my lords this initiative is certainly brave and well-intentioned but i fear that if we are not careful it could cause great danger to the long-term unity of the united kingdom <e> <s> i have no personal connection with ulster and i speak as one whose foremost concern is the unity of the kingdom <e> <s> if which heaven forbid <e> <s> northern ireland breaks away from or is forced out of the united kingdom i fear that it will be only a matter of time before there is a rekindling of nationalism in other parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> many of our best generals in the last war were ulstermen and as churchill made clear the last war would have been lost if it had not been for ulsters bases and ports <e> <s> as he put it i believe without ulster we would have been confronted with slavery and death <e> <s> but who knows a future war may not be the nuclear holocaust that is all over in hours <e> <s> there may come a time when we have once more to fight a battle of the atlantic when ulsters ports and air space would be vital <e> <s> what happens in ireland is very much our concern <e> <s> it always has been and it always will be <e> <s> nor should we forget that the ultimate aim of the ira is a marxist ireland with all its horrifying implications something that we can never allow in the british isles <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill <e> <s> my noble friend the minister may be interested to know that the national union of ratepayers association of which i am president also supports the aim of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am much indebted to my noble friend lord marshall of leeds for initiating this important debate <e> <s> i am sure that both ratepayers and ratepayers associations up and down the country will be equally grateful for his most impressive speech <e> <s> it was what one would expect from him after such a distinguished career in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am acutely conscious that i am one of the very few speakers who does not come from scotland <e> <s> indeed i come from that deprived part of the uk called england <e> <s> i intervene as this bill is a forerunner of a bill for england and wales and the government have declared their intention to introduce similar legislation at a later stage after the general election <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the few english speakers i intervene because as was the case when this matter was discussed nine or years ago my foremost concern is still the possible grave implications for the unity of the united kingdom in the event of devolved government for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one of the few english speakers from this side of the house who spoke on the second reading of the bill for the abolition of domestic rates in scotland just over a year ago <e> <s> i did so with a sense of some foreboding <e> <s> i recall saying that i had considerable misgivings about the legislation on grounds of fairness and practicability although i congratulated the government on their courage in tackling at long last the problem of getting rid of our domestic rates <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> as a lifelong conservative and a firm supporter of this government and our prime minister it gives me no pleasure to find myself taking what is possibly a different view from that of some of my noble friends on this occasion <e> <s> even so i support this amendment which has been so ably moved by my noble friend lord chelwood <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether the government have now grasped the simple reality that if they must have a universal flat rate tax it must be a very low one well below the governments own target estimate of and covering purely local services <e> <s> otherwise the tax will be politically unacceptable and it will become as it has already become a recruiting agency for the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always supported the abolition of the discredited rating system <e> <s> it is over and done with and it is no good harping back any longer on how frightful it might have been under the rates system <e> <s> the government now stand and fall at the moment they are stumbling pretty badly on their very own community charge or poll tax <e> <s> that is what people will vote on in the may local elections <e>"]
