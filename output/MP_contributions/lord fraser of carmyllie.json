am not sure whether to congratulate or whether to commiserate with the noble lord for having to spend so much time on this matter <e> <s> i do not know whether he was on cases one <e> <s> two or three

mean that a third party dealing with the company who knew no more than that the directors were exceeding their powers and was not involved in any way further then it would be simply a matter of knowledge <e> <s> i indicated to the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton that it is possibly a somewhat grey area but if it was only a matter of knowledge there is at least the risk that he would be liable as constructive trustee <e>", "<cs> obviously i did not express myself very clearly <e> <s> there is a circumstance in the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has certainly given me food for thought

lloyd of kilgerran and the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton want to raise on subsequent amendments <e>", "<cs> while i note what the noble lord has said about proposals of now a greater degree of european assimilation might be achieved this amendment cuts down on the protection which third parties ought to have in dealing with a company <e> <s> it would appear to me in connection with the european comparisons made by the noble lord rather to hark back to the present sect ion of the companies act which refers to acts <e>", "<cs> we need to provide some gloss to the meaning of good faith

beyond what is presently required of us <e> <s> it certainly would not be appropriate as the noble lord seemed to be suggesting that the terms of article which i read out could simply be lifted <e>", "<cs> it is accepted <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the wording of this amendment is drawn from an option in article of the directive and that its adoption would not be contrary to our community obligations <e> <s> however we have identified certain difficulties with this option which we have sought to overcome by the wording of new section b <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble lord would read what i have said <e> <s> i have sought to stress that the test exists by reason only of a person knowing <e> <s> if that is appreciated i believe that the matter falls into the proper

section and the new section a from his observations on this subsection it appears to me that he understands the relationship very well <e> <s> as he said amendment no <e> <s> c would prevent ratification if the act in question has caused the board to be liable as constructive trustees while the third amendment the second one referred to would prevent ratification where the act amounts to a misappropriation or fraud or misfeasance on the part of the directors <e>", "<cs> on the contrary while the noble lord is waxing eloquent i do not wish to stop him in mid-flow <e> <s> however it might be helpful if i indicate that the position that is indicated there remains much the same <e> <s> we are indeed considering whether section ab might be deleted since as he pointed out and was indeed supported in that view there is an argument that it is redundant <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can elaborate beyond what i have said <e> <s> the matter is being considered <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can give an immediate commitment to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought that it was nevertheless helpful if not to him then to the noble lord lord lloyd to say that he need not elaborate on it <e> <s> he apologised for having put down no amendment but wished to raise the subject again <e> <s> i thought that it was only courteous and helpful to him to indicate that consideration was indeed under way <e> <s> if the noble lord considers our progress and i know how anxious he is to move forward on this bill the likelihood is that it will be put down in the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord understood from that that the secretary of state personally through a quango or through his civil servants was going to withdraw recognition of an individual solicitor <e> <s> i apologise for the drafting that it is not what is intended <e> <s> the intention is to indicate that apart from the rules setting out the competence requirements there might similarly be provision for how those who have not maintained an acceptable standard of competence might be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an area in which it is right and proper for parliament to consider that it has a right to intervene and to set those regulations <e> <s> it is made clear in the yellow paper that the secretary of state does not become involved in the matter in terms of having his own quango but takes the opportunity in the public interest to provide regulations for what has not been covered <e> <s> the third purpose is that there may be rules relating to the role of courts in constraining the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that what i thought would be seen as a modest attempt to bring matters in scotland broadly speaking into line with england and wales should have been debated at great length in both this house and another place <e> <s> i am surprised that this measure should have caused any query at all <e> <s> however i shall attempt briefly to explain the matter <e> <s> we are not attempting in any fashion to introduce anything that is novel or different for scotland <e> <s> without entering yet again into the political controversy about where the supply of water should rest nevertheless i should say that the supply of water in scotland will remain within the hands of the regional or island authorities <e> <s> we have taken the view that if there should be any failure to supply water in terms of the regulations that the secretary of state sets out or circumstances occur where the water is unfit for human consumption because the suppliers are still within the control of a public authority they should not escape prosecution <e> <s> those who supply water from within a private organisation would not escape prosecution in similar circumstances <e> <s> broadly speaking that is why we have at this stage decided that it is important to introduce these changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend who is an expert on these matters of drafting <e> <s> you cannot have water that is wholesome and unfit for human consumption but you could have water that is unwholesome but is nevertheless not unfit for human consumption <e> <s> that is the point that i sought to make <e> <s> there is a gradation in these matters <e> <s> it might be that the secretary of state by way of regulation would seek to ensure that water that was unwholesome was brought up to standards of wholesomeness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the welcome that he gave to this order and also to the noble lord lord meston for the approval that he has signified <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for not requiring me to pronounce the names of the two greek professors who now find themselves by name within our legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords how much it is used i do not know <e> <s> certainly it is a complicated matter <e> <s> clearly we shall wish to see that these elaborate provisions that have been introduced are used effectively for those people who have cause from time to time to secure enforcement of their judgments within the european community <e>", "<cs> perhaps at this point i may respond briefly to the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> as she made clear the amendment would require supermarkets where they have three or more points of sale never to have

am happy to attempt to elaborate briefly on this matter <e> <s> however i emphasise to the noble lord that by introducing these provisions we are not in any sense depriving local authorities of their right to go to court to have any matters that concern them dealt with by the court of session in edinburgh <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated discussions are already being held <e> <s> i understand that that follows upon the exchanges to which the noble lord has referred during the passage of the legal aid bill <e> <s> clearly it is a project of major proportions <e> <s> i am aware that the scottish law commission which is some way ahead in its consideration of the project has already recognised that while the focus of public interest is in relation to personal injuries the issue of representative or class actions has a wider application and may be of particular worth in the field of administrative law <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is referring to the scottish law commission when speaking of the second part of the question <e> <s> the commission is hoping to publish a discussion paper on class action procedures early next year <e> <s> as i have

priorities that it otherwise has to meet <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry announced last week that subject to the views of interested parties he was inclined to accept the law commission recommendations <e> <s> he added that he was currently seeking those views and that his department would be directly consulting individuals and organisations known to be interested <e> <s> that consultation is also to be carried out in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the scottish law commission did a considerable amount of work on this subject in and proposed a statutory offence <e> <s> the law commission report which came two years later took into account a great deal of further evidence that has emerged on the fast moving issue of computers and recommended two further statutory offences <e> <s> it would be eminently sensible to follow the line suggested by the law commission for england and wales that it would be desirable that the criminal law in relation to unauthorised access to computers should be uniform throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> it expressed the hope that that end would be achieved by uniform provisions in

pre empt what might be in the queens speech and the governments programme thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am willing to convey my noble and learned friends view on that matter <e> <s> i have noted with approval that it appears to enjoy almost universal support in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i can gauge from what has been said in the house this afternoon it would not appear to be an issue which would arouse much controversy <e> <s> however as i indicated i think it is desirable that we should tidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in

remedies that there might be <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble lord has just said he seems to agree with me that an ultra vires act can be set aside where the third party has no knowledge of

anticipated that the noble lord would be concerned about the fact that just because someone knows something it is not automatically to be assumed that he is acting in bad faith <e> <s> an example

thought it right to make clear that a person would be protected from limitations imposed by a resolution of such a class <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has built an elaborate edifice on what is a very small amendment <e> <s> i do not entirely follow the reasoning behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it reworks the provisions in the bill on transactions with directors or connected persons where the board has exceeded any limitation on their powers under the companys constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords

that sometimes it was not that civil servants wished to have to themselves a broad ill-defined area of discretion but that often it might be said that they sought too great detail in the arrangements under which they operated and that sometimes meant that there were pieces of secondary legislation which were extremely difficult to penetrate <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord appreciates that on this clause it is important that the inland revenue should be discharged from the duty that it owes of confidentiality in respect of this information <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord morton indicated the provision in clause a is more than sufficient for my purposes <e>", "<cs> as i believe has been appreciated as the consideration of the amendment has proceeded we have ranged rather more widely than the matters encompassed by the amendment <e> <s> the amendment and those which follow centre on the issue of whether or not there should be an index or register to facilitate greater access to charities in scotland <e> <s> while i do not accept my noble and learned friends description of that as being a glaring omission from the bill it is primarily intended that there should be supervision of charities in scotland which i believe we all appreciate has been a glaring omission from the law in scotland for some considerable time <e>", "<cs> i do not suggest at this stage that there should be designation of a body but i thought that i had given a pretty clear hint of a body that might be suitable for taking on just such a task <e>", "<cs> i do not know about that trust <e> <s> it is certainly conceivable that it is registered and from the noble lords description of the provision of fuel for the poor in kirriemuir it appeals at first blush that it has every possibility of being accepted as a charitable trust <e> <s> however once this part of the bill is in place it will be possible not only for organisations but for individuals to make inquiries and to discover whether it has been so registered <e>", "<cs> i have told noble lords that there are reasons for discussing the matter further <e> <s> if the noble lord consults the paper which we prepared before the legislation was introduced he will see that we made it clear that we did not wish to go down the road of establishing a charities commission such as that which obtains in england at present <e> <s> i think that those who have some familiarity with it will appreciate that the charity commissioners have had very real difficulties and have been subjected to considerable criticisms in recent years <e> <s> a slavish following of that model did not appear to me to be the most appropriate way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> perhaps i am bound to tell the noble lord that regrettably supervision in scotland has been sadly lacking <e> <s> i do not in any way suggest that anything other than a tiny minority of charities in scotland may be abusing their positions <e> <s> at risk of repeating myself i emphasise that we shall look very carefully at making much more widely available the information that is held on microfiche so that it is available to those who want access to it <e>", "<cs> i do not know about any english one <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that it would have the full information given the duty that is imposed upon the inland revenue not to reveal information <e> <s> it cannot be all-revealing <e> <s> there are many respectable and worthwhile charities which go out of their way publicly to make clear their purposes and what funds they have available <e>", "<cs> as i have already indicated i cannot come forward with what the noble earl wants as a complete scheme <e> <s> i have repeatedly said that the information held by the inland revenue is held on a list or index whichever word one wants to use on microfiche in edinburgh <e> <s> that complete list will be available to anyone who calls at the offices and wishes to see it <e> <s> i may be wrong but i should have thought that further information in greater detail was wanted <e> <s> i urge that upon noble lords <e> <s> but i believe that there is better access to that information through other provisions <e> <s> however if it is simply a matter of obtaining the information from the inland revenue large portions of which may be out of date or quite inaccurate that information on the microfiche index will be available in edinburgh <e>", "<cs> i am getting very close to the risk of being repetitive <e> <s> i thought that i had just clearly indicated to the noble earl that if he chooses to spend his leisure time at the offices of the inland revenue in edinburgh he will be able to see the listing of charities on microfiche <e> <s> that may not be spelt out in the clause but i would not have thought that that was truly a criticism of the drafting of the clause <e>", "<cs> i accept the spirit of the amendment put forward by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the amendment is introduced to ensure that a charity should not be in danger of being listed for failing to produce a copy of its trust deed until it has been paid for the reasonable cost of its production <e> <s> with the undertaking that i shall bring forward an amendment to achieve that aim i hope that the noble and learned lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> the thinking of the government is in line with that of the noble earl and indeed that of the noble lord lord macaulay <e> <s> in principle we accept these amendments <e> <s> it is my intention to provide by amendment on report for a choice of court in all cases where i have power to apply for an interdict or order <e> <s> those occur at clause clause clause and clause <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to provide that any person who has a complaint that a body has failed to provide under subsection a copy of its founding deed may apply direct to the court to interdict that body or a person involved in the management or control of that body from engaging in any activity specified in the application to the court <e>", "<cs> so far as the common law is concerned there is nothing in these provisions which is intended to deprive any individual in scotland of the rights that he would have before the courts <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes me to consider whether it might be made clearer that following on a complaint under subsection i might take the more draconian step of approaching the court for an interdict i shall undertake to consider that and write to him if necessary to ensure that it is clear that such a complaint might lead the lord advocate of the day to take such steps <e>", "<cs> i understand now for the first time what the noble and learned lords are driving at <e> <s> i confess that i had taken from it a rather different message that they sought quite specifically to restrict powers of interdict to bodies which were incorporated and they were not dealing with unincorporated bodies <e> <s> that is clearly contrary to my intention <e> <s> i wish to be in a position to take action against a wider range of bodies than that <e> <s> given the point that the noble and learned lord raised i shall look at that again <e> <s> with the greatest respect i am not entirely sure that i agree with what he says but given the power of the heavy duo in the middle i should like to look at this matter again <e>", "<cs> other than setting up a directory i believe that this is the most important point which arises during the committee stage on part i of the bill <e> <s> i hope i shall be forgiven for taking a minute or two to explain the position as i see it <e> <s> i indicate immediately that i understand the aim of the new clause and the amendments and what lies being the idea namely that clearly very important religious organisations in scotland may be afforded special treatment <e>", "<cs> i should love to consider that point <e> <s> however i am reminded of the leading case or charity law in scotland <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord had given me a moment i should have given him the quotation which was <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can usefully add anything to the debate which i have already had with the noble and learned lord about what is or is not a charity in scotland <e>", "<cs> with that helpful indication it will be apparent that i join the opposition front bench in saying that i consider that if we are to have these provisions it is important that there should be some policing of them <e> <s> we must therefore necessarily provide some sanctions <e> <s> i think it is right that we should have those although i would say to the noble and learned lord that i accept that there will clearly be some circumstances where the common law would provide an offence under which to charge those persons who are representing themselves to be a charity <e> <s> nevertheless in spite of that as the noble lord lord macaulay has said i <e>", "<cs> the matter arises under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i may more appropriately reply to the noble lords question in connection with that amendment <e>", "<cs> we are moving quite widely around the provisions regarding offences <e> <s> i hope that i have followed them all as i should have done <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble and learned lord in respect of clause that failure to comply with an order of a court would attract a sanction from that court <e> <s> i might look at that point again <e> <s> i see what the noble and learned lord was driving at <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly answer that question <e> <s> first however i should apologise to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he raised this matter in the last amendment and i omitted to answer him <e> <s> one has to understand the scheme that we are setting up <e> <s> if one is to hold oneself out as a charity one has to go to the inland revenue and secure the recognition that is allowed for under this bill <e> <s> the terms used are <e>", "<cs> if the amendment moved by the noble lord lord grimond was to be allowed it would restrict the duty to maintain accounting records and prepare annual accounts to those concerned with the management of a charity <e> <s> this is narrower than the requirement under the bill which lays the duty on those concerned with the management or control of the body <e> <s> if restricted to management there may be a risk that a situation could arise where the managers have been dismissed leaving only the controllers in place <e> <s> i concede that that may not be a very likely situation but it may be prudent to retain the words or control against the possibility of unscrupulous controllers dismissing managers to avoid any obligation being imposed by the provision <e> <s> it is for that limited purpose that the wording has been used <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can elaborate on the response i have just given <e> <s> as i indicated it may be that people would seek to delegate the management to someone else although they were effectively in control <e> <s> however if the noble lords amendment was allowed thus restricting the provision in this way only those responsible for the management would suffer <e>", "<cs> i do not want to protract the argument any longer than i need to but i do not think that i can give a check list of what offers the noble lord ought to accept <e> <s> it would be for him or anyone else who became involved in such organisations to determine whether the office he assumed was one which imposed upon him some degree of control or alternatively management <e> <s> the purpose of the provision is that one should not be able to escape from ones responsibilities by appointing managers and then pulling out of the organisation <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord seeks to remove the requirement under clause b which requires bodies to keep accounting records enabling them to meet the accounting requirements specified in clause <e> <s> the maintenance of proper and adequate accounts is central to the bills object of ensuring that charities are publicly and openly accountable for their actions <e> <s> the removal of the requirement at clause b would be in effect to permit charities to keep records in any way they chose irrespective of whether they were capable of enabling compliance with the requirement at clause <e> <s> this would have a seriously detrimental effect on the effectiveness of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has added a further amendment to the very lengthy list which i considered might be appropriate <e> <s> i agree that it might be helpful if i deal with it now by commenting on what he has said on amendment no <e> <s> and others that come with it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that observation <e> <s> i suggest that a choice might be given to a trust or the trustees because they may have friendly people who can help them to present their accounts in the best possible form <e> <s> at the same time provision should be made for smaller charities to do this without the same degree of accounting detail that might be necessary for say a very large charity one can think of a number whose income and capital runs into thousands if not millions of pounds <e> <s> in such circumstances clearly such large charities should be subjected to the most strenuous of accounting requirements <e>", "<cs> the purpose is not to impose this duty on any particular trustee but indicate the type of places where the records might be kept <e> <s> that might be either with the trustee or as i have indicated with the treasurer <e> <s> i anticipate that in such circumstances the greatest likelihood is that the records will gather dust in some solicitors safe <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord has clearly indicated in moving this amendment there is already provision to exempt classes of a recognised body from the requirements of this section <e> <s> i cannot conceive of any circumstances where he might wish to exempt any particular body other than possibly the church of scotland which we discussed in connection with another amendment <e> <s> if that is what is in mind i rest on what i said earlier namely that we have to look at the matter in a broader context <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to restrict the exemptions which my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland could make with respect to clause to the preparation of a balance sheet and income and expenditure account <e> <s> as i have already indicated under my amendment no <e> <s> i shall be seeking the approval of the committee to provide a choice for smaller charities to prepare accounts which will not comprise a balance sheet and income and expenditure account <e> <s> it may be that my right honourable friend will wish to exempt classes of bodies from that requirement too <e> <s> that might fit in with what the noble and learned lord lord morton indicated with regard to the smallest of charities <e> <s> the acceptance of this amendment would preclude that <e>", "<cs> ten months is not a period that was selected at random as it were <e> <s> it is the period permitted for the production of accounts under the companies acts <e> <s> larger charities are as large or larger than many companies <e> <s> on that basis it was considered reasonable that they should have the time to prepare their accounts <e> <s> i would certainly suggest to the noble lord that the three-month period that he has suggested was a tight period <e> <s> if months has been the accepted period in relation to companies legislation i would suggest that it is the one that we ought to hold to here <e>", "<cs> while i accept that the amendment is not strictly consequential upon the previous one i had anticipated that if the noble lord had been successful in achieving a three-month period he would have wanted this further arrangement before involving the courts to allow a further extension if the three-month period could not be met <e> <s> it is a somewhat unnecessary amendment which goes against the thrust of his earlier amendment <e> <s> it would allow for a further extension by the court rather than restricting power to me where a -month period is allowed for under subsection <e> <s> if the body cannot do it within month it is appropriate that the matter should be left to the lord advocate to deal with without necessarily involving the courts <e> <s> it is merely a matter of administration <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is correct that subsections and should be the same <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the amendment of the noble lord is intended to be a clarifying amendment to make clear that i may make inquiries in consequence of a complaint from a person having an interest in the body <e> <s> however the clause provides that i should be able to act on information from any source be it a person with an interest in the charity the inland revenue or whoever it may be <e>", "<cs> a balance has to be struck between protecting the individual and protecting the assets of the charity and the public who support it <e> <s> it may be of little comfort to either the charity or the public if money is frittered away through incompetence and i was unable to act because such action is not wilful <e> <s> the object of my having powers to suspend by order is to enable me to act immediately in order to protect the property of a charity or a purported charity <e> <s> the purpose of that suspension might be to establish whether or not that action was wilful <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to extend property in clause a ii to include funds <e> <s> to give effect to this amendment similar consideration would need to be given to the use of the word property throughout part i of the bill <e> <s> i consider that property is wide enough to include funds and on that basis i would invite the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government believe that it is important to distinguish between the powers which the noble earl referred to at subsection a to f and those at paragraphs f to j <e> <s> the powers at paragraphs a to f are essentially of a temporary and protective nature <e> <s> before applying them the court need only be satisfied under the clause that there is or has been misconduct or mismanagement or and i stress this that it is necessary to act for the purposes of securing proper application of the property <e>", "<cs> i will check that <e> <s> i thought it was clear enough but i will look at it again <e>", "<cs> under subsection to which this amendment relates the earlier government amendment becomes subsection <e> <s> the amendment tabled by the noble and learned lord seeks to exclude the role of the lord advocate to bring a scheme before the court of session for the transfer of assets of a body which has been guilty of misconduct to another body <e>", "<cs> subsections to provide powers to deal with charities which are based in england but which transfer their money or securities to a bank or a financial agent in scotland <e> <s> most will have good and legitimate reasons for doing so <e> <s> however in some cases transfer of money to scotland may be in order to escape the control of the charity commissioners in england and wales <e> <s> the controls in the bill at subsections to are severe controls designed to signal to any dubious charity which thinks that it can escape the control of the charity commissioners by transferring money to scotland that it is much mistaken <e>", "<cs> as i attempted to point out this measure is intended to catch not the perfectly legitimate and worthwhile charities which for very good reasons that i might encourage them in make some or all of their investments with a scottish institution <e>", "<cs> as regards a hearing on expenses the noble and learned lord will appreciate that i will be moving amendment no <e> <s> which he indicated might have been grouped with amendment no <e> <s> i accept the validity of the point underlying his amendment to that extent <e>", "<cs> i certainly envisage that <e> <s> as the matter looks at the moment in terms of clause it appears a rather startling circumstance that the court can award expenses against someone without hearing that person <e> <s> if there is any further intimation required and the court considers that appropriate i envisage that that will be provided <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain the mischief to be met in terms of clause lb <e> <s> there could be an award of expenses against someone concerned in the control of the management of a body notwithstanding the fact that he is not a named party in the proceedings <e> <s> it was envisaged that there might be four or five people involved in the management and control of a charity <e> <s> let us say that four of them were named parties in the proceedings <e> <s> as matters stand the fifth person might find that there was an award of expenses against him as well <e> <s> it is that set of circumstances which may be remote that we have to anticipate and deal with <e>", "<cs> as i indicated earlier i am agreeable to the idea that there should be a choice of courts for most aspects of the bill <e> <s> however the provisions that we have discussed with regard to clause contain as our recent short debates indicated complex controls and serious penalties <e> <s> i believe that in those circumstances it is essential that those powers should be exercised exclusively by the court of session <e>", "<cs> i do not think so but i shall check and make sure that there is no difficulty with the drafting <e>", "<cs> this short debate on who is or is not in management control and the additional group the noble earl has put forward in his amendment and i believe that the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna is correct in saying that it prescribes a secondary group who might be caught by this provision amply demonstrates why we have chosen the terminology management or control <e> <s> we intended it to be as wide as possible <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may conclude this discussion by briefly saying that the test is that of management or control <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mackie takes on yet another honorary presidency in the fair borough of kirriemuir i assure him that just because he assumes that honorary capacity he is not immediately to be sent to gaol <e>", "<cs> there might be little purpose in doing it in ordinary circumstances particularly when the new clause that i should like to introduce by way of the next amendment would meet the very point that the noble earl asks of me that there should be the opportunity for <e>", "<cs> on a number of occasions i have said to the noble and learned lord lord morton that i shall take matters away and consider them again <e> <s> i hope that he will reciprocate the courtesy by looking again at the earlier clauses of the bill and examining how they link up with these provisions where the term used is that of a public trust <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a term which he understood well enough and that he knew what particular favour such trusts enjoy before the court of session at the present time <e> <s> in this clause we seek to expand the basis on which a <e>", "<cs> there is a short answer <e> <s> as the clause stands at the moment the court of session would be well capable of expanding the jurisdiction that it enjoys in <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is necessary to define what is meant by annual income in this clause <e> <s> we have defined the phrase in terms very similar to that suggested by the noble lord lord macaulay at clause <e> <s> given that definition it is part of the interpretation clause affecting this part of the bill i should have thought that the amendment was unnecessary <e> <s> however in principle i understand the point that the noble lord is trying to make <e> <s> i hope that the present definition is sufficient to enable trustees to know whether they are within that limit <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to elaborate at any great length in view of what i have said about amending the clause <e> <s> i am not attracted to what the noble and learned lord says about taking the power away from me <e> <s> that is not because i wish to have any exclusive right on the matter <e> <s> i suggest that the noble and learned lord considers the relationship between clauses and <e> <s> if for some reason i am dissatisfied with what is being proposed that does not deprive the trustees of going to the court to have the matter dealt with be it the court of session or the sheriff court <e> <s> that procedure would still be open to them <e>", "<cs> i recognise that in these amendments there is a desire to establish in scotland a body similar to that of the lord chancellors advisory committee on legal education and conduct to be established under the courts and legal services bill <e> <s> i am surprised so early on to find myself in agreement with the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> it is fortuitous and indeed felicitous that the first debate on this part of the bill has at the centre of its attention the services that are provided to the consumer of legal services a term i use now that the noble lord lord grimond has disappeared <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lords for the brief introduction and support that they have provided for this amendment <e> <s> i say immediately that i understand why they are concerned by the amendment at the centre of the matter relating to clause where confirmation services are defined <e> <s> in that clause confirmation services are defined as <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the further points that have arisen <e> <s> i must have expressed myself poorly to the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> i referred to the provision of financial services by those in banks and indeed solicitors offices <e> <s> if they were to give investment advice they would find themselves covered by other regulations in relation to the providing of that investment advice <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that observation <e> <s> i acknowledge the concerns expressed about the apparent imbalance between the publicly funded conveyancing board regulating the provision of conveyancing services by conveyancing practitioners and the self-regulating body of solicitors providing identical services funded entirely by the profession itself <e> <s> i believe however that the relatively small amounts of public money which we expect might be needed to get the board up and running may well represent a cost-effective means of establishing a satisfactory regulatory regime for the protection of clients interests in the initial stages of the new arrangement <e>", "<cs> because i indicated to the noble lord that i would take the matter of a loan away and consider it i do not think that i can answer that question <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord is perfectly correct to look to what is set out in the explanatory and financial memorandum under the heading of financial and manpower effects of the bill <e> <s> it states there that <e>", "<cs> the issue here is not that there should be a continuing cost <e> <s> if there had to be a continuing cost it would have been most important to indicate what it would be <e> <s> we are talking about the setting up and commencing costs <e> <s> i do not think that i can expand upon what is set out in the explanatory and financial memorandum <e> <s> as i said when attempting to answer the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey if i cannot produce such a figure before we next consider the matter i shall certainly write to him with the relevant information <e> <s> probably the best estimate i can give is about <e>", "<cs> under the law of scotland the preparation of missives for the purchase and sale of land are not regulated at all <e> <s> there is no monopoly conferred upon solicitors in that very important task <e> <s> indeed as one looks to the development of missives in scotland at the present time and to the simplification that there has been in recent years in conveyancing i should have thought that many objective observers having regard to the liabilities that might be incurred at different stages would conclude that the preparation and concluding of missives is possibly even more important than the conveyancing itself <e>", "<cs> the first amendment that we are discussing relates to the chairmanship of this board <e> <s> while i can readily enough see that those who have legal expertise should be members of the board i cannot see why the particular public interest essentially is discharged by limiting the secretary of states choice of someone to head this important new body to a serving member of the legal profession <e> <s> that is not to say that that person will not be drawn from the ranks of the legal profession <e> <s> however it does not seem to me to be necessarily appropriate to have that requirement <e> <s> the responsibilities and skills of a chairman would seem to me to be the compelling necessity in this case <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend i did not say that he was not to be a lawyer <e> <s> i merely indicated that i thought it would be inappropriate to tie the secretary of states hands by requiring him to select his chairman exclusively from the ranks of serving members of the profession <e> <s> i certainly did not intend to indicate that the chairman would not be a lawyer <e> <s> i put forward the arguments on this matter on the basis that he should be given the opportunity to select someone who would be a good chairman whether or not he is a lawyer <e>", "<cs> what i wanted the noble and learned lord to take from it is that while i accept what he and others have said on the question of balance i do not think that we can look absolutely to what is provided in the courts and legal services bill <e> <s> when one looks at what is imposed on the secretary of state in terms of paragraph i should argue that albeit by a different route the balance that the noble and learned lord wishes to achieve would be accomplished that way <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord raised the preliminary point why were not executry practitioners or confirmation practitioners drawn into that <e> <s> the issue goes back to a debate that we have already had <e> <s> i do not seek to reopen it <e> <s> it was understood that given the narrow range of compensation it was not necessary to do that <e> <s> i shall come back to the matter as i indicated to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had spoken to it along with amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> i put it to the committee that age is not an appropriate test <e> <s> it is the fit and proper test that is of importance to the general suitability of a person putting himself forward as a practitioner in this field <e> <s> i appreciate that solicitors must be <e> <s> however their qualifications and training will take them at least five years to acquire <e>", "<cs> there is one circumstance in which a person may be under the age of <e> <s> a qualified conveyancer may work for a conveyancing practitioner <e> <s> in such circumstances it may be appropriate that he should be entitled to exercise the skills that he has acquired <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the difficulty experienced by both noble and learned lords in seeing the immediate relationship between the two amendments tabled in my name and theirs <e> <s> however the group has correctly been identified <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> a i propose that wherever may appears it should be deleted and replaced by shall <e> <s> the amendment is more elaborate because it goes on to include consultation with the director general of fair trading <e> <s> members of the committee will be aware of elaborate provisions concerned with the director <e> <s> however this is not an appropriate point to deal with them as wider comment may be sought to be made <e> <s> i can assure the noble and learned lord that the provisions in his amendment are dealt with in mine <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e> <s> there are also new clauses after clause proposed in amendments nos <e> <s> f g and h <e>", "<cs> i am saying exactly the opposite <e> <s> in line i am prepared to see the introduction of shall rather than may <e>", "<cs> i began by offering an apology to noble and learned lords who had tabled amendments and i repeat that now <e> <s> i appreciate that it is difficult to follow what has happened as regards the deletion of may and the insertion of shall which i consider to be appropriate <e> <s> however i hope to try to get the discussion back on the right lines by leaving out any consideration of the role of the director general of fair trading at this stage although there are a large number of amendments to be considered <e> <s> i hope that we can deal with them comprehensively <e> <s> while they are extended the presence of the director general of fair trading is already in a number of clauses <e> <s> i do not intend to introduce a new principle here involving him <e> <s> it is merely to expand and clarify what will be his role <e> <s> i could have introduced those matters on report but i have no doubt that the noble and learned lord would have argued even more powerfully that that was an inappropriate stage at which to introduce them <e>", "<cs> that was my intention although i do not anticipate that we shall reach the amendments this evening <e> <s> because of the reference to them in earlier clauses i hope that we can have a broader discussion on them and if there are points to be raised there will be a further opportunity to do that on the next committee day on the bill <e>", "<cs> if i recollect the discussion on this point at second reading i was only asked to move from may to shall as i have done <e> <s> i am not entirely sure as things stand that if i do not move in the direction requested of me it will wholly exclude all the judicial review <e> <s> i should like to reflect on that matter <e> <s> i am not convinced that that is absolutely so but i undertake to look at it again <e> <s> it is certainly the intention of the secretary of state that there should be regulations made under subsections and <e> <s> by introducing shall i hope that i signalled that clearly <e> <s> if i have to semaphore more clearly i shall do what i can <e>", "<cs> the noble lord offered the opinion that unless i accepted the amendment tabled judicial review would be excluded <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am not totally persuaded that that would happen <e> <s> i indicated that that is a matter on which i should like to reflect <e>", "<cs> i indicated that i would consider this point <e>", "<cs> i am vastly impressed by the manner in which the noble earl lord balfour examines the details of this bill <e> <s> it is an extremely helpful drafting suggestion which may clarify the intentions of the provisions and i am therefore happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> that is certainly not the intention <e> <s> introduced the amendments for the very purpose of ensuring as best we can that those who provide services cannot evade their responsibilities by revocation <e> <s> i shall look at the matter again <e> <s> i had hoped that where reference was made to the fact that there were adequate arrangements in respect of the business that would be sufficiently wide to cover the matter but i shall look at it <e>", "<cs> as i indicated we are anxious to ensure that the keeper is able to verify credentials <e> <s> there are comparable provisions

subsequent change to the register is contained in amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> this amendment places the duty to make regulations about the conduct and practice of the board on the board itself

<s> if that was all the amendment did there might be little harm in it but it also excludes the secretary of state from the task of specifying what is to be included in the code <e> <s> that would create difficulties with regard to the public interest <e>", "<cs> i have no difficulty in accepting that the matters which these amendments <e>", "<cs> if it will help us to make progress in view of the arguments advanced by my noble friend lady carnegy i propose to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i neglected to do so that is correct <e> <s> it is so grouped <e> <s> these provisions are very similar to equivalent provisions in the solicitors scotland act although they may be more succinct <e> <s> however it is envisaged that it would be open to be the board to nominate another practitioner to take over the affairs of the practitioner who has ceased to practise <e>", "<cs> i believe that that point was answered at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> we are not dealing with the solicitor <e> <s> we are dealing with the conveyancing practitioner <e>", "<cs> this amendment places a duty to make regulations regarding conduct and practice on the board itself rather than the secretary of state <e> <s> that was essentially dealt with when we dealt with amendment no <e> <s> if i am not mistaken <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that there is a guarantee fund which is

constraints <e> <s> we have been discussing how in future conveyancing services will be provided <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment in the context of the level playing field concept which has so dominated the debate about <e>", "<cs> we have set out fully in the clause the signposts in terms of the code of conduct <e> <s> for example i have referred to matters relating to interviews with clients which as i understand it are at present not a requirement imposed on solicitors <e> <s> although there might be some differences i cannot envisage that there will be any material differences between the duties imposed on conveyancing practitioners and solicitors <e>", "<cs> if i appeared to indicate that the director general of fair trading had an involvement in the interests of justice that was incrorrect <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the secretary of state having received that advice to put it into a broader context as he sees it <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey sees it in its proper form before report he will be satisfied <e> <s> but i wholly understand his position <e>", "<cs> as i understand there are no restrictions on who may register deeds or documents in the register of inhibitions and adjudications nor in the sheriff court books <e> <s> that being so it is not necessary for the purposes of such registrations for the keeper of the registers or sheriff clerks to know the names of those who are registered as qualified conveyancers <e> <s> in view of that it appears to me that the noble lords amendment unlike others where there was a necessity to notify who was a qualified conveyancer is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i have already indicated that this amendment is acceptable <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take this matter away and consider it <e>", "<cs> in many respects the bill provides for conveyancing and confirmation practitioners and qualified conveyancers to be subject to a regulatory regime similar to that applying to solicitors <e> <s> for example the requirements for registration include indemnity insurance and the requirement to comply with practice rules <e> <s> there are many other similarities in the handling of complaints and discipline <e>", "<cs> i had sought to indicate to the noble and learned lord that i hope that what is already in place will be sufficient to meet all the difficulties met by a client going to a conveyancing practitioner <e> <s> i hoped to indicate the fact that there is a possibility that a document similar to a practising certificate will be in place <e> <s> he may consider that i am naive <e>", "<cs> it may come as a surprise to the noble and learned lord that it was not a matter of discourtesy towards him <e> <s> part of his provision is worth while that is subsection a on annulments <e> <s> on report i propose to move an amendment which will provide for a variation order <e> <s> therefore far from being ungracious i was hoping to thank him for tabling his amendments <e>", "<cs> as i indicated if we are looking not only to put conveyancing practitioners in the same position as solicitors but also to reassure clients i would consider whether the noble and learned lords suggestion is necessary <e> <s> if it is not adequately covered by the amendments i have already moved i shall certainly look to achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> it is correct that when we have concluded clause we shall turn to the wholly different issue of rights of audience and i appreciate as clearly as the noble and learned lord that we have been going for a long time <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern that lies behind both new clauses which was also <e>", "<cs> in saying that it had been put in hand by my right honourable friend i did not mean that it would be a research project undertaken in circumstances of the utmost secrecy <e> <s> if there are important lessons to be learnt i entirely agree with the noble and learned lord that those who are interested should know the results <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may rise arguably prematurely <e> <s> what i have to say may be helpful to the committee <e> <s> it is my intention to accept amendment no <e> <s> a moved by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am grateful to him for putting it down <e> <s> i understand that it enjoys not only his distinguished support but that of his successor as lord president <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the great care that he has given to the preparation of the amendment and for suggesting ways in which the requirements to be placed on those who seek rights of audience in the supreme courts might be better defined to match more closely the practice and procedures of those courts <e>", "<cs> i shall add a postscript to those remarks <e> <s> while i understand that there is a proposal that we should stop at amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i may modify that by suggesting that we go to amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble and learned lord lord emslie has spoken <e> <s> i do so because i have indicated that i am sympathetic to that amendment and propose to return at report with an amendment referring to the desirability of having essentially similar rules for all supreme court pleaders <e> <s> i give that indication now and ask that when we come to that amendment it is withdrawn to enable me to do that <e>", "<cs> at two earlier points i indicated my sympathy for this amendment <e> <s> given that undertaking i invite the three noble lords whose names appear in support of the amendment not to pursue it <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble and learned lord that it is not just an expression of sympathy <e> <s> it is an indication that i will return on report with an amendment to meet what he is proposing <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have made my position clear <e> <s> i understand very clearly what the noble and learned lord lord emslie has said about the importance of maintaining objectivity detachment and of ensuring that there is no risk of witnesses being influenced intentionally or otherwise <e> <s> that view is correct <e> <s> i have indicated that i wish to find a way of resolving this problem other than that suggested by the noble and learned lord which is by maintaining the rule as it stands <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to take up time but some important matters have been raised here <e> <s> yes i have been in consultation with the law society on matters that have been brought up by noble and learned lords <e> <s> we dealt most particularly with what was to happen in the circumstance where a solicitor advocate had to respond to an instruction to appear in court <e> <s> we discussed what happened in relation to other professional obligations that he had already taken on <e> <s> it was for that reason that at the beginning of subsection the amendment says about those instructed to appear in audience in any of the courts mentioned <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not want to indicate that i would not reconsider this matter <e> <s> however as i said the faculty of advocates has set out an order of precedence <e> <s> i suppose it would be possible to set out an order of precedence on the face of the bill but i think that would be wrong <e> <s> the court itself should consider that matter in discussion with the law society <e> <s> if it disapproved it is open to the lord president to refuse to accept that measure <e> <s> however in opening i said that the rules would doubtless equate broadly with similar rules made by the dean of faculty in relation to advocates <e> <s> i put that in that slightly cautious way because there may be some differences but to all intents and purposes i would expect them to be identical <e>", "<cs> if it will bring matters to a conclusion i agree to look at that point <e>", "<cs> what is proposed is that where there is immunity from suit for advocates that would apply equally to solicitor advocates <e>", "<cs> the overriding objective of the reform of the legal profession has been to secure the provision of services which satisfy necessary consumer standards but are not unduly restrictive <e> <s> it is for that reason that the secretary of state and the director general of fair trading whose perspectives go much wider than the legal profession itself have been accorded a significant role <e> <s> the purpose of giving a role to the secretary of state and the director general is so that any differences which do arise can be fully dealt with <e> <s> i hope that in most if not all cases it will be possible for any differences to be resolved without recourse to the formal provisions of the clause and that those will serve largely as a reminder of the wider public interest which the secretary of state and the director general will bring to bear <e>", "<cs> i was asked by the noble and learned lord to explain whether there was anything further behind the provision <e> <s> i thought that the clearest way to explain the matter and in view of the question of the noble lord lord morton i must have made a mistake was to fix it in the context of what was proposed for the faculty of advocates <e>", "<cs> yes i do but it is clearly not entirely absolute and it is a matter of allowing rights of audience <e> <s> it is not a matter of trying to interfere with the constitution of the court or any such matter <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble and learned lord there is a clear distinction between those matters <e> <s> if i wanted to withdraw the amendment i should say so explicitly <e> <s> if i was not prepared to consider the matter and was not prepared to move on it the committee could decide whether it wished to call a division <e> <s> i have indicated this is a perfectly standard process that i have listened to a point that has been made to me <e> <s> i wish the amendment that i am moving to become part of the bill but i am giving the noble and learned lord an indication because of the point that he has made that i shall look at it <e> <s> if i consider that it should be amended i shall amend it myself if i fail to do so it is clearly open to the noble and learned lord to repeat his objection at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond very briefly <e> <s> no we are not trying to make solicitors and advocates identical <e> <s> if that were to be done we should simply say that all solicitors were to have rights of audience in both the court of session and the high court of justiciary <e> <s> we are not setting out to develop such a scheme <e> <s> we say that there are those solicitors who if they have the requisite training and qualifications may secure those rights of audience while still remaining solicitors <e>", "<cs> i am indeed content to accept the amendment in the name of the noble and learned lord lord emslie which i believe gives the <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can expand on what i have said <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord macaulay has picked up my wording <e> <s> it is inserted as a reminder to all concerned of the importance of securing in practice the extended rights of audience which are being conferred by this clause <e> <s> that is all that is intended <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord will be aware that i was equally conscious that i was leading with my chin on this matter <e> <s> it is the governments view that this provision should be included in the clause <e> <s> if he wants to laugh rather than cry i would be happy enough with that <e> <s> but i invite him to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from where the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey sits he may be unconcerned about incurring the wrath of my noble friend lady carnegy by repeating what he said at second reading <e> <s> however from where i stand it might be more politic of me to make a short response to this matter otherwise i shall be repeating what i said at second reading <e>", "<cs> i was about to say just that <e> <s> i am anxious to point out to noble and to noble and learned lords that before the royal commission was the question of looking at extending the rights of audience essentially against a background when fusion was in the air <e> <s> what is now being considered is not to give extended rights of audience to all but only to certain solicitors of particular competence <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord will give way i shall stand corrected on the figures <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that in comparison with england where i understand that what rights there are at present for solicitors to appear in jury trials are non-existent or very limited in scotland there is an extended right for solicitors to appear before juries <e> <s> that is further extended by recent legislation which allowed me as lord advocate to direct that some cases which would attract a sentence of as much as three years imprisonment ought to be heard in the sheriff court <e> <s> i should have thought that many people would have considered that that was a very wide right of audience <e>", "<cs> i am content to accept the principle of the new clause <e> <s> as i understand it it was suggested by the present dean of faculty <e> <s> it is an important and worthwhile clause <e> <s> however i should like to reflect further on the precise wording and the best location in the bill for the provision <e> <s> i undertake to come back at report stage with an amendment which has a like effect <e>", "<cs> i had thought that the lord chairman of committees had called amendment no <e> <s> regarding the concern of the noble and learned lord about the act of union <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i did not hear him say that he was <e>", "<cs> with one breath the noble and learned lord and others indicate that we are doing this only because it is being done in england <e> <s> when it comes to scotland my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has taken his own policy decision <e>", "<cs> that is a matter for the secretary of state <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord wants me and the secretary of state to keep such persons out of the court of session he does not even wish to see them appearing as pleaders i find it inconceivable that he wants them to be there as judges <e> <s> if he were arguing that they should be there i could see why he might press me to explain why i am not prepared to see them there <e> <s> he does not want them there and in those circumstances the matter should rest there <e>", "<cs> i can only say yet again that on these matters my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland is entitled to take policy decisions that affect scotland alone <e> <s> he does not have to decide to follow what is being done in england any more than my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in introducing his legislation had to follow what was being taken on board in scotland <e>", "<cs> i have said now repeatedly in this extended debate that the secretary of state considers that it is not appropriate <e> <s> he is the policy minister in scotland <e> <s> i do not think there is anything between what i have said and what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> i do not want to develop the point and i can discuss it with the noble and learned lord later <e> <s> but i understood that for example a solicitor is a writer to the signet <e> <s> is that person not a member of the college of justice <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lords amendment is defective in that it does not have a question mark at the end of it <e> <s> i appreciate that there are groups of specialists who wish to have rights of audience and that surrounding that area of specialisation other legal issues may arise <e>", "<cs> subsection b i already makes clear that any application submitted under this clause would require details of the training requirements which the body would impose upon its members if it were to be successful <e> <s> i therefore suggest that the first two of these amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> the word training here is not confined to practical training and is therefore wide enough to encompass the acquisition of knowledge as well as skills <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment is either to remove entirely the power given to the secretary of state under subsection to prescribe in regulations further matters to be included in any draft scheme submitted by an applicant body under this clause or to pass the responsibility for so prescribing to the lord president <e> <s> the committee will readily appreciate that to remove this power entirely would be a potentially dangerous step <e>", "<cs> i thought that we were addressing this matter when speaking to the last amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord said that he would read what i had said in relation to the last amendment <e> <s> i had covered what i thought we were dealing with in a coupled fashion namely his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to provide the lord president with a power that he simply does not need <e> <s> i accept that the duties imposed on the lord president by this bill may give rise to further work for his office <e> <s> he does not however need a power in primary statute to engage additional staff presumably at some cost <e> <s> that may be as the noble lord lord grimond appreciates a rather startling idea <e> <s> if however the lord president feels that it is necessary he can approach the secretary of state who is responsible under the administration of justice scotland act for the appointment of staff of the lord presidents private office and that has to come from general taxation <e> <s> however i think that it would be an undesirable precedent to give the lord president a power in this way <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> there is some risk that in the way it is approached it might appear that a scheme is being approved in a somewhat clandestine manner <e> <s> obviously it is not our intention to do that <e> <s> nor would it be our intention to set up a too elaborate arrangement or set of complicated duties with regard to intimation advertisement and the like <e> <s> we certainly would not want a measure such as one finds frequently under such legislation as the town and country planning provisions <e> <s> however i understand why there might be a desirability to have some intimation perhaps to such bodies as the faculty of advocates and the law society <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble lord will withdraw the amendment and let me take it away for further consideration <e>", "<cs> clearly as the noble lord lord macaulay has indicated one would expect the lord president of the court of session to have regard to the administration of justice in any decision that he had to take with regard to the approval of a scheme under this clause <e> <s> the objectives of a wider choice of representative in maintaining the efficiency of the courts are not necessarily incompatible objectives <e> <s> on the other hand the convenience and efficiency of the courts <e>", "<cs> in this brief debate on the amendment such language as watering down the competence of those who are available to appear has been used <e> <s> i say at the outset that should a group of persons put forward a scheme under clause to allow them to have rights of audience in the high court of justiciary i do not envisage in any circumstances that there would be a dimunition of the standards that are expected in that court at the present time <e> <s> i cannot conceive of any circumstances where the lord president in having regard to an application under clause or the lord justice general as i should say in relation to the high court of justiciary would not have regard to the concerns of noble and learned lords that very serious criminal charges might be confronted <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can <e> <s> i have explained the position <e> <s> the noble and learned lord may find that amusing but i thought that explained most clearly what the scheme entails <e> <s> i should have thought that he understood readily enough how legislation which provides for a scheme with arrangements to be filled in at a later stage goes forward especially when it is left to the lord president or to the lord justice general <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord mentioned earlier it may be that there will be no such group of people who have sufficient expertise to achieve what is proposed <e> <s> the scheme is as i have explained it and i do not think i can elaborate <e>", "<cs> if it is a term of art i am afraid i do not know it <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness cares to look at clause she will find that under any scheme put forward thereunder the approval of the lord president or the lord justice general of the high court of justiciary will be required before any group of people can apply <e> <s> that is what i referred to in my explanation <e> <s> it is the senior judge either in a criminal or civil capacity in scotland who would be required to approve such people <e>", "<cs> that would be to invite me to reveal a known and personal prejudice <e>", "<cs> i am willing to consider this matter further <e> <s> i see no need for approvals under clause to be subject to conditions given the mechanism for consideration of a draft scheme and the offering of comments upon it <e> <s> on the other hand there may be circumstances where there ought to be provision for a review of rules or schemes once approved <e> <s> i shall give further thought to the noble lords argument in that context and if appropriate bring forward suitable amendments at report <e> <s> with that undertaking i hope that the noble lord will be willing to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a point i shall take into account in examining the matter before the report stage <e>", "<cs> we dealt with this matter at some length in relation to clause in which there is a provision in exactly the same terms <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i thought we had already fully dealt with the matter <e> <s> i cannot give the noble and learned lord a precedent <e> <s> i believe that i explained the reasoning behind the provision in some detail when we last met in committee <e>", "<cs> i shall look at the point raised by my noble friend lord balfour <e> <s> as regards the natural person it is envisaged that a professional body will be making applications on behalf of its members who are natural persons and individuals <e> <s> they will not be other associations or companies but one professional body making applications for its individual members <e>", "<cs> we dealt with the matter earlier and i pointed out that as a matter of drafting it is correct to use the word natural when one is speaking of a person <e>", "<cs> following his consultation with the director general of fair trading the secretary of state shall have regard to matters mentioned in subsection b or c <e> <s> subsection a is a matter exclusively for the lord president <e> <s> subsection b is a matter in which they are both involved subject to the limitations highlighted by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> subsection c is a matter for the secretary of state <e> <s> however i emphasise that the scheme falls if in any part the lord president does not come to an agreement <e>", "<cs> i have already indicated that there are further necessary amendments but <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to accept the amendment which i believe will give the lord president a proper role in assisting the secretary of state when he is making regulations about rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation for lawyers from other jurisdictions in the united kingdom <e> <s> in my view this role for the lord president will sit conveniently among his present duties and the new functions which he is to be granted in relation to rights of audience for solicitors in the supreme courts and rights for non-lawyers to appear in court under clause <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised that we have become involved in a more general consideration of the clause under this small amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord grimond that under subsection practitioner is used in the singular <e> <s> however when we reach subsection it is used in the plural <e> <s> i accept that there ought to be a uniformity of approach and i shall take steps to ensure that that uniformity is achieved by way of amendments <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord morton indicated if practitioners is used in the plural in subsection there will be an is out of place <e>", "<cs> the arrangement is this <e> <s> in terms of subsection the secretary of state makes regulations which enable practitioners entitled to practise <e>", "<cs> where someone met the regulations that are required under subsection the lawyer be he english welsh or northern irish would be a lawyer for all purposes <e>", "<cs> as i understand it this amendment is based on an objection to the fact that persons qualified furth of scotland other than solicitors or barristers may in certain circumstances be able to practise in scotland <e> <s> i was specifically asked by the noble and learned lord whether the government proposed that such persons should be allowed to practise <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton has already remarked there is a parallel provision to be found in the courts and legal services bill in clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that correction <e> <s> i must say i thought the provision was in clause but i shall check up on that <e> <s> that provision would allow persons from scotland who have acquired practising rights under clause of the bill to practise south of the border <e> <s> subsection b acknowledges that a person who has passed through the rigorous requirements to acquire rights of audience or rights to conduct litigation in the courts of another jurisdiction of the united kingdom might be sufficiently qualified to do so in certain circumstances in scotland <e> <s> in that event it would be unnecessarily cumbersome to impose upon such persons a requirement to conform specifically with the requirements which govern applications for rights of audience or rights to conduct litigation under clause <e> <s> without going back over the debate we had on clause i can safely say that i do not envisage that the secretary of state will make many regulations under this subsection <e> <s> nevertheless in answer to the question posed i should say that it is the policy that there should be a proper cross-border reciprocity <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will appreciate that this bill ties in whether he likes it or not with the provisions of the courts and legal services bill <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble and learned lord we are returning to discussion of clause <e> <s> in a clear and articulate fashion he has made clear the reason why he takes exception to those pleaders <e> <s> i shall not follow his description of them as barefooted <e> <s> given that certain provisions contained in the courts and legal services bill will allow those qualified under clause either to have rights of audience or and i stress rights to conduct litigation in england there appears to be a solid basis for arguing that there should be reciprocity <e> <s> it is on that basis that we go forward <e>", "<cs> i had hoped when speaking to an earlier amendment that i had indicated that obligations arise under ec directives made in and whereby the persons whom we are discussing are lawyers in their own countries <e> <s> i accept that we have now moved on to another class of persons namely those who are not qualified solicitors or barristers on this side of the border but who fall into the class of persons who might be given rights of audience or the right to conduct litigation in england <e>", "<cs> i shall consider the point regarding the involvement of the lord president <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that assistance with the drafting <e> <s> i shall look at that point <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord wishes me to delete the provision at a later stage i shall consider that <e> <s> he might wish to talk with the dean of faculty beforehand <e>", "<cs> certainly i can say to both noble and learned lords who have spoken that i do not think that there is any difference except that it is to adopt the language of the noble and learned lord to provide a level playing field <e> <s> as i explained because it is the right given under clause to rules made by the council of the law society it was considered only proper that a comparable provision should be introduced in respect of advocates <e> <s> we have a long enough bill <e> <s> if it is felt that this part might be deleted from the bill at some stage far be it from me to stand in the way <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i meant to point that out <e>", "<cs> subject to the further amendment of that amendment i am happy to accept the amendments <e> <s> they would further limit the secretary of states involvement in approving law society rules <e> <s> rules which permitted multi-dis-ciplinary practices subject to restrictions would not require his approval <e> <s> therefore such rules in due course would be subject to the direct supervision of the com petition authority that we have proposed in our white paper on restrictive trade practices <e> <s> if that is what is desired by the law society i do not object to the amendment <e> <s> my offer to accept extends to amendments nos <e> <s> c and d which as i understand it are the two amendments grouped together at present <e> <s> so far as concerns the other two amendments i am not quite sure how they tie in <e>", "<cs> it may help make for greater understanding of this difficult provision if i remind the committee that this is not the only provision in the bill that bears upon the formation of partnerships by solicitors <e> <s> in schedule of the bill is to be found the repeal of section of the solicitors scotland act whereby the statutory barrier to mixed partnerships will be removed <e>", "<cs> i agree that it is desirable that the lord president should approve of these rules <e> <s> however as we have seen emerging at an earlier stage there is no need for this express amendment as all rules made by the law society require the approval of the lord president under section of the solicitors scotland act <e> <s> with that explanation i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will appreciate the provision at present is that at the scottish bar there cannot be partnerships between practising advocates <e> <s> from what is proposed in the dti white paper <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the provision is this <e> <s> there is an existing rule as the noble earl appreciates that there should not be partnerships <e> <s> if advocates wish to avoid having that rule subjected to the scrutiny of the proposed competition authority they should secure the approval and agreement of the lord president and in these circumstances and more importantly the agreement of the secretary of state <e> <s> once they have secured his agreement then the competition authority would be precluded from subjecting it to any further scrutiny <e>", "<cs> i am not making any assumptions at all <e> <s> i am giving the faculty of advocates the opportunity of which i suggest it may avail itself to go to the lord president and to the secretary of state and secure agreement to its <e>", "<cs> i am indeed aware of that and i think the noble and learned lord may take it that it is the knowledge of that which at least in part lies behind the particular formulation of this provision <e> <s> if i were to be advising the fuculty of advocates which i am not given the well-known views of the present director general of fair trading it might be well advised to get on with the matter as soon as it is open to it to do so <e>", "<cs> i hope i can reassure the noble lord that i do not think anyone who considers this matter very carefully particularly in the context of what is proposed in the dti white paper will consider that this is an unacceptable handing over by an independent body like the faculty of advocates of a regulation or an important rule that it has and that is in any sense damaging to the faculty of advocates <e> <s> if the noble lord reads carefully what i said i think he will appreciate that this is something that i understand the faculty of advocates would be pleased to see on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> this matter has caused considerable interest <e> <s> however as my noble friend indicated it clearly excites more interest among practising lawyers than among the general public <e> <s> the amendment was indeed carried during the report stage of another bill where the make-up of the majority was interesting <e> <s> i trust that it will not draw any adverse comment when it reaches another place <e> <s> that would be very unfortunate <e>", "<cs> i should like first to answer the point made by my noble friend lord selkirk <e> <s> if he cares to read clause he will see that an advocate is defined there as <e>", "<cs> all i can say shortly in answer to that is that the language to be found in subsection d reflects that in clause <e> <s> i am extremely fearful of again entering into debate upon that clause <e>", "<cs> this is a very important amendment <e> <s> the powers which the lord chancellor seeks to enable the legal services ombudsman in england and wales to make recommendations about compensation are targeted on high levels of client dissatisfaction there with the way in which the complaints system is operating <e> <s> it has been clear for some time that the reforms of the complaints procedures for solicitors introduced in england and wales in the mid s have not been a great success <e> <s> backlogs threatened to choke the system and client satisfaction has not significantly improved further change was therefore called for <e> <s> in scotland by contrast reform came later and it is now little over a year since the law society of scotland gained access to the new shoddy work powers and remedies conferred on it by the solicitors act to which the noble and learned lord lord morton has just referred <e> <s> i hope he will not fall off the bench if i say that i entirely agree with him that it may be too early to judge the full effect of these changes <e> <s> but the early indications are favourable <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has referred to section of the act <e> <s> i accept that at first sight that appears to be the most appropriate analogy because those who would be appointed as temporary judges would serve either in the high court of justiciary or in the court of session <e> <s> however the situation is not as simple as that because those who are retired judges have previously received their commissions from the crown <e> <s> in those circumstances it is wholly appropriate for the lord president to take the leading role albeit with the consent of the secretary of state who has responsibilities for the funding of the supreme courts <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord has been good enough to indicate we have had the opportunity to discuss this matter briefly <e> <s> the need for a range of changes to the judicial pension schemes has been examined by ministers in various departments in the united kingdom who have an interest in these matters <e> <s> it has emerged clearly from the examination that not least due to the sheer complexity of the various schemes a piecemeal approach would be totally inappropriate <e> <s> accordingly as announced by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in this chamber on i believe th february of this year the government have decided that the whole situation calls for a radical examination <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said at col of <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any misunderstanding about the position of <e>", "<cs> i have sufficient regard for the writers to the signet all of them or whatever the number to know that they appreciate that there is little or no prospect of their surmounting it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the noble and learned lord that i appreciate his understanding that i am concerned with achieving <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the noble lord that if he wishes to table an amendment proposing an alteration for advocates it is a matter that we might look at <e>", "<cs> we covered much of this matter in the previous debate <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord opposite and the noble and learned lords on the cross-benches can think of members of the faculty of advocates and others who have exercised rights of audience for considerably longer than five years years or years and who despite that regular exercise of their rights of audience are extremely unlikely to be appointed to the court of session bench <e>", "<cs> this amendment was originally tabled by the noble and learned lord lord emslie and i am grateful to him and to those who have spoken in support of it <e> <s> i wish to indicate to the committee that i accept the amendment as it is tabled <e> <s> i should say that i understand it was always the intention of the present lord president lord hope to carry out such consultation but it is clearly no bad thing that that consultation arrangement should be spelt out on the face of the statute <e>", "<cs> there is nothing to prevent such an agreement <e>", "<cs> i shall look at that again <e> <s> to make progress on this the noble lord lord macaulay will appreciate that the law society and ourselves are anxious to allow two bases on which accounts between a solicitor and a client can be settled in future <e> <s> first my later amendment which i hope will be accepted will provide that if there is a written agreement to settle what shall be the fees the well established procedure of going to taxation to establish what is the precise amount of the account will be excluded <e> <s> however if there is no such <e>", "<cs> i understand the thinking behind this amendment and the reason why the noble lord is anxious to ensure that any client who has been misled by his solicitor should be protected <e> <s> i consider that the general law of contract both the common law and case law is extensive and detailed and can be relied upon to provide a basis for deciding any claim a client may wish to make relating to the circumstances in which an agreement was entered into <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point made by the noble and learned lord regarding the provisions of this subsection which is concerned with the role of the auditor in respect of legal aid <e> <s> this is not defined in the legal aid scotland act but appears in regulations and is a legacy carried forward from when the fees were prescribed by the lord president of the court of session <e> <s> an alternative to the auditors role in relation to legal aid was first contemplated in <e> <s> this allowed my right honourable friend the secretary of state to prescribe regulations to provide for the assessment and taxation of fees and outlays and for the review of any such assessment either by himself or by any other person <e>", "<cs> i shall think about the amendment but i also invite the noble and learned lord to read what i had to say <e> <s> i believe he will appreciate that there is not as much between us as he seems to think <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these provisions is that legal aid advice and assistance are obviously available under the existing legal aid arrangements in scotland if one wishes to obtain advice from solicitors <e> <s> this provision is to permit if there are to be confirmation and conveyancing services provided by confirmation and conveyancing practitioners in the same way that if advice and assistance are sought they should be obtainable from them as well <e> <s> it is a sensible extension of the broad provisions that we make for legal aid in scotland <e>", "<cs> it is not a matter of whether he should get advice or assistance but who is going to pay for it <e> <s> as i have said under the legal aid provisions in scotland at the moment there is some advice and assistance which will be paid for by the state under the legal aid acts <e> <s> we are proposing that if comparable advice is sought from this new breed of practitioners then in such circumstances and by way of an extension legal aid should be available as regards those persons <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey indicated from the time when the bill was first printed reference was made to the director general and what role he should take in giving advice to the secretary of state <e> <s> what we have in these new clauses is a far clearer and fuller explanation of where the director general would intervene what his advisory and supervisory function should be what his investigatory powers should be and what are his functions in relation to rules made under the act <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has not always been entirely complimentary to this part of the bill <e> <s> he indicated that these provisions were an improvement and i believe that they are <e>", "<cs> they are new powers in relation to what the secretary of state will be doing <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend would care to look at amendment no <e> <s> j he will find at page line that i shall be inserting <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the applicant for a new off-sale licence or for the renewal of such a licence to lodge a plan with the clerk of the licensing board <e> <s> this is similar to the existing provisions relating to public house and hotel licences <e> <s> the present provisions have operated since the licensing scotland act came into operation <e> <s> i am not aware that the exclusion of off sale premises has created any problems for licensing boards <e> <s> if the amendment were carried it would place an additional burden on small businesses at a time when the government are anxious to reduce controls <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his support <e> <s> the amendments seek to allow sunday opening of public houses and licensed clubs between the hours of and pm <e> <s> the original purpose of parliament in enacting section of the licensing scotland act which prohibits sunday afternoon opening was to prevent all-day bar drinking on sundays particularly when this was unrelated to the service of meals <e> <s> the consultative review of the act sought to ascertain the views of all those who would be affected by possible changes to the existing licensing laws and the responses showed that a clear majority of respondents were opposed to any extension on sunday of permitted hours for public houses <e>", "<cs> i understand that my noble friend lord lucas wishes to deal with his amendment no <e> <s> separately <e> <s> however throughout the amendments that we must consider to every clause the difficulty is that in scotland there are people who hold deeply the view that there should be no relaxation of licensing provisions there on the sabbath <e> <s> i suspect that the same is true south of the border <e> <s> in a clear and equitable fashion the simplest approach would be to make sunday the same as every other day of the week and to allow all opening hours on the sabbath to be exactly the same as those from monday to saturday <e>", "<cs> that was what i said <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can expand upon the amendment <e> <s> i certainly understand the logic of it <e> <s> it is clean and tidy <e> <s> if those people who run retail outlets for example with off-sale premises within them were to be enabled to open earlier than pm it would clearly be logical and helpful to them and to a proportion of their customers <e> <s> however my noble friend will appreciate that others whose views have already been expressed and are expressed in a subsequent amendment take a diametrically opposed view to his <e> <s> there is no absolute answer to the problem <e> <s> we have achieved as best we can a balance between those conflicting interests <e>", "<cs> this is the point at which the crossfire in which i indicated that i was caught reveals itself <e> <s> on the one hand my noble friend lord lucas thinks that i am being far too restrictive from the other side i am being implored to impose yet further restriction <e> <s> i can only repeat that i do not think that we shall attain a perfect balance in this matter <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to include specifically within the list of competent objectors the licensed trade association <e> <s> licensing boards already consider objections from licensees in the neighbourhood of the premises to which the application before them relates <e> <s> accordingly a licensed trade association which by definition would represent local licensees is already covered by the provision <e>", "<cs> clause deals with new provisions relating to the new sunday opening hours for public houses and refreshment houses which are not presently opened on a sunday <e> <s> the clause removes the need for separate application to be made by licensees in respect of sunday opening <e> <s> the act at present requires a special application to be made for sunday opening of public houses or refreshment houses in accordance with procedures set out in schedule <e> <s> separate applications are not required in respect of sunday opening of hotels or restaurants <e> <s> the clause allows application for the grant or renewal of a public or refreshment licence to include sunday opening but provides a safeguard that licensing boards may refuse sunday opening where they consider it would cause undue disturbance or public nuisance in the locality <e> <s> while it is our intention to streamline the application procedures we do not wish applicants to be in the position where contrary to the present situation they may not be able to apply for a sunday opening licence after they have been granted a licence for opening on monday to saturday <e>", "<cs> clause as presently drafted provides for restriction orders in respect of afternoon and sunday opening now included in the new permitted hours <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b would enable the board to consider not only present public nuisance considerations but also past or future considerations <e> <s> this goes beyond the intention of the present clause which simply adds afternoons and sundays to the restriction order provisions <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i have some difficulty in knowing how to respond to the noble lord regarding this particular amendment given that i understood it to be coupled with other amendments which he has not moved <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e> <s> perhaps i might consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i do not understand what he is moving in the context of that group of amendments but i will consider the matter <e> <s> if it is something that we need to sort out at report stage we can do so but i think i would be wasting time to try and unravel where this particular provision lies in relation to the others <e>", "<cs> the proposal is that there should be a right of appeal to the sheriff <e> <s> in our view these are judgments which the boards are best placed to make on the basis of their detailed local knowledge <e> <s> the same applies if anything with more force in the case of occasional extensions <e>", "<cs> the chief constable is in a unique position in that in terms of section l c of the act the licensing board is required to refuse an application if undue public nuisance or a threat to public order and safety is likely to be caused <e> <s> the chief constable has a professional interest and duty in relation to consideration of such issues and we consider that he should be enabled to make observations on any application where he considers this appropriate <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong to consider that there is anything other than widespread concern about under-age drinking in scotland <e> <s> that was expressed in response to the scottish home and health departments consultation paper on licensing law in scotland which was issued in october <e> <s> my noble friend lord jenkin of roding may well recollect that that widespread concern spilled over after the jimmy hood bill last year into what was frankly some rather unpleasant and irrational reaction to carefully presented views in this house at that time <e> <s> i mention that point only to underline the degree of concern in scotland <e>", "<cs> yes i have indicated to my noble friend that if he will withdraw the amendment i shall take the matter away and have a further look at it <e>", "<cs> clause substitutes a new section for the existing provisions giving the police a new power of entry into clubs without a warrant from the sheriff <e> <s> the provision seeks to mirror the entry powers available in respect of other licensed premises <e> <s> however the entry powers in the bill are more restrictive so far as the police are concerned because they permit entry only at all reasonable times <e> <s> the amendments would require the police to provide the offender and the club with written reasons for wishing entry or for noting of entries where the police entry has been refused or obstructed <e> <s> this goes far beyond the requirements in relation to powers of entry to pubs and hotels <e> <s> i cannot see any justification for such a significant difference <e>", "<cs> i understand the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> that is why i sought to stress that there is a due diligence defence <e> <s> it is not difficult to imagine that if all sorts of drunks were allowed to obstruct entry to the clubs no one would gain entry <e> <s> there the due diligence would not be open <e> <s> however if for example a casual friend of a member got into a position in which he restricted access for a member of the constabulary i have no doubt that the defence of due diligence would apply <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the noble viscount that i cannot envisage a situation where the first part of this amendment would be necessary <e> <s> at present the list of competent objectors is in section of the act and includes any person owning or occupying property within the neighbourhood of the premises to which a licence relates <e> <s> i should have thought that that covered any community charge payer who lived in the vicinity of the relevant property <e> <s> section also refers to any organisation which in the opinion of the board represents owners or occupiers <e> <s> in practice that also includes groups of local community charge payers <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to bring hotels with a restricted licence restaurants and refreshment establishments into line with public houses and hotels <e> <s> the present act differentiates between those establishments whose main function is to serve alcoholic liquor and those whose main function is the provision of food with drink as an ancillary <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord said the scottish law commission on whose recommendations section of the administration of justice act is based is currently considering this question in the light of the recent case of <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble and learned lords lord morton and lord mccluskey seeks to retain two years as the period of separation for divorce with the consent of both parties instead of the reduced period of one year proposed in the bill <e> <s> in making these proposals to alter the periods the scottish law commission on whose recommendation these proposals are based stated the situation shortly and simply <e> <s> it said that the periods chosen are arbitrary within a certain range <e>", "<cs> one year is proposed where there is an agreement by both parties that the marriage is effectively at an end <e> <s> once parties have <e>", "<cs> i should immediately say that i have some sympathy with the principle of this amendment <e> <s> it is clearly desirable that parties should enter the conciliation process with no inhibitions that what they might say could subsequently be used against them if the conciliation failed and they had to resume their litigation <e> <s> there are however issues which i believe require further and serious consideration <e> <s> in particular it would be necessary to achieve a balance between the desirability of making available to the court all relevant evidence in a case and the understandable concern about confidentiality in relation to the conciliation proceedings <e> <s> clearly we would not wish to provide blanket confidentiality which might preclude the parties or the conciliator giving evidence on for example child abuse <e> <s> we should also wish to avoid creating any incentive to repeat something to a conciliator so as to attract confidentiality <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which the scottish law commission addressed following representations made to it by scottish womens aid when it was considering the reform of grounds for divorce <e> <s> however the commission took the view that this important question was not directly linked with the divorce reform which it recommended and which is given effect to by clause <e> <s> it further suggested that consideration of this question should not delay implementation of that reform <e>", "<cs> the amendments relate essentially to the occupancy rights of cohabiting couples <e> <s> i continue my refrain that the scottish law commission is involved in this matter and intends to publish a discussion paper this month on the effects of cohabitation in private law as a precursor to <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to tackle a problem encountered by some sheriffs in applying the provisions of section biii which enable the sheriff to order the detention of a non-applicant spouse where the sheriff is satisfied that there is a substantial risk of violence by him against the applicant spouse or any child <e> <s> the amendment would substitute the words <e>", "<cs> i would be grateful for a clear understanding of the basis on which my noble friend makes that decision <e>", "<cs> in view of the lengthy and involved contributions that have been made i should like briefly to summarise <e> <s> in my wildest <e>", "<cs> i have already indicated that i consider that that is the appropriate place to do it <e> <s> i certainly do not advocate that anyone should do that but i believe that that is the appropriate place to do it in relation to both jurisdictions <e> <s> that is why i think it is inappropriate to deal with it at this stage <e>", "<cs> as i understand matters yes or i should not have suggested it to the committee <e> <s> it would have been utterly dishonourable of me to have done otherwise <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord would not expect me to suggest an inappropriate way of dealing with the matter <e> <s> i would not have dealt with it in any other way unless i thought that it was something that should be done <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that there may be circumstances in which a nearest relative may be unsuitable to act as such <e> <s> for example it may be that in the past the nearest relative has been implicated in the abuse of a patient <e> <s> it would then be clearly inappropriate for such a person to exercise the nearest relative functions <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord and to the law society of scotland for bringing this matter to my attention and i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to specify circumstances in which it would and would not be acceptable to resile from a contract to purchase heritable property when a title was found to contain a reservation of minerals <e> <s> the amendment also implies into deeds a compensation clause for the owner of the surface where there is a right to work minerals <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment i should like to refer also to amendments nos <e> <s> ub zb and a which are in my name <e> <s> the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna relates to two separate matters in the family law scotland act <e> <s> the first part of his amendment clarifies an important point in section a of the act which has caused difficulty in the courts <e> <s> the amendment provides that in making orders by way of financial provision for the applicant the court may in appropriate circumstances make a property transfer order and award a capital sum <e> <s> the government accept the principle of this part of the noble and learned lords amendment and i trust he will accept that government amendment no <e> <s> ub makes provision for this <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zb is consequential <e> <s> government amendment no <e> <s> a seeks to ensure that new provisions are implemented as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> in dealing with this amendment we are going over well-trodden ground which to some of us in this house and in another place caused a great deal of concern as my noble friend lady carnegy indicated <e> <s> but i hope that i may deal with the matter briefly in this way <e>", "<cs> there is i think general agreement that a great deal of time can be spent in criminal trials leading evidence which is uncontroversial and which is unlikely to be challenged <e> <s> it is clearly therefore in the public interest that further ways should be found consistent with fairness to the accused in which routine and uncontroversial evidence can be put to the court in a manner which does not unnecessarily take up the time of the court <e> <s> there already are procedures which do so such as joint minutes of admission agreed between prosecution and defence and statutory certificates with regard to routine evidence <e> <s> the present amendment is an example of how these procedures can be further extended to some extent perhaps drawing on the provision with regard to statements relating to drug trafficking contained in section of the criminal justice scotland act <e>", "<cs> the changes contained in the proposed new clause to the existing provisions relating to the retirement age of the senior judiciary are as my noble friends lord selkirk and lord stodart indicated of considerable substance <e> <s> the i potential effects of the proposed changes on the <e>", "<cs> as has been indicated in england and wales a protection similar to that proposed by this amendment is provided by the enduring powers of attorney act <e> <s> i think that there will undoubtedly be general agreement in the committee that we should make appropriate legislative provision for those who are unfortunately unable to manage their own affairs <e>", "<cs> the scottish advisory committee noted particularly that an aim of the model law was to prevent the use of the courts as a <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord morton would have two effects <e> <s> it would retain the offence provisions applying to the preparation of writs relating to moveable estate and to an employee acting on behalf of his company to draw or prepare a writ relating to court proceedings <e>", "<cs> i indicated at the outset that i want to reconsider one aspect of the amendment i moved the requirement for the tribunal to give named publicity where there is no finding or a finding of innocence so to speak of professional misconduct or of inadequate professional services <e>", "<cs> yes and in view of the full and persuasive arguments advanced by the noble lord i am delighted to accept this amendment <e> <s> it can only be reasonable for the law society to enjoy the same degree of protection in the discharging of its statutory functions under the act as the board will enjoy under the terms of this bill <e> <s> while i am not aware of any cases which point to a pressing need for an exemption from liability for damages for the society i can clearly see how one may arise <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord morton for tabling the amendment and to the noble lord lord macaulay for moving it <e>", "<cs> the word sheriff is used rather that the words sheriff principal <e> <s> i believe that will mean any sheriff at edinburgh but if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> while i recall that the recently retired lord president of the court of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be involved in the redrafting of the articles of faith of any religious body <e> <s> i understand what the noble and learned lord is saying <e> <s> i do not envisage that there will be any particular difficulty in that regard <e> <s> if i have to consider a large number of documents clearly more lax arrangements will need to be put in place than had been envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i clearly cannot calculate at this stage how many bodies might approach me in seeking my approval <e> <s> contrary to what the noble and learned lord lord morton said i envisage that most bodies which already have a clearly defined trust deed will put that forward <e> <s> one needs to consider and what i envisage will occur in relation to any directory that often a trust deed is a long complicated document <e> <s> for their own purposes charities may wish in explaining what they do to provide a simplified explanation of their range of activities and how they expend their funds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord cameron of lochbroom raised a question in committee on clause as to whether it was possible to interdict an unincorporated body <e> <s> i undertook to give this matter further thought <e> <s> according to stair encyclopaedia vol para it would appear to be the case that it is not possible for such bodies to sue or be sued in the court of session although it may be possible in the sheriff court <e> <s> i concluded that the safest course is to make specific provision <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> therefore extends the present limited definition of body in clause <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for drawing the matter to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been indicated we have discussed the matter previously <e> <s> it is the undoubted policy of the bill to provide supervision over all scottish charities <e> <s> that the provision should apply to all charities irrespective of size was a policy strongly advocated to the government by the scottish council for voluntary organisations <e> <s> it is difficult to know what should be the appropriate cut-off point if this exception is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wholly sympathetic to the aim of the amendments but i do not believe that it is necessary for them to appear on the face of the bill <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has powers under clause to prescribe by regulations the form and content of accounts including any information to be provided by way of notes to the accounts <e> <s> an inquirer has a right to obtain a copy of the actual trust deed under the provisions of clause <e> <s> that provision was inserted at the suggestion of the scvo in preference to a summary of the principal objects <e> <s> the notes will however require a summary of the bodys activities over the year having regard to its charitable purposes <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend suggested this allows something of a reference back to the making up of a directory if that is what is wanted <e>", "<cs> my lords the powers look very similar to those provided in section of the companies act <e> <s> if they have not been entirely helpfully introduced into the clause i shall look at the matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will appreciate that i am not giving an undertaking to come back with anything <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that <e> <s> the history of this is that we started off by thinking how can we get at these people who are behind a bogus trust <e> <s> when action is taken how do you get on to them and take some action against them <e> <s> we modified that to say that if expenses were going to be awarded against them they ought at least to have the right to be heard <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have hinted previously i have considered the suggestions made at committee stage by the noble and learned lord and others on this issue and have decided that there is a case for extending the facility that arises under clause to all public and i stress the word to the noble and learned lord to whom it doubtless makes sense trusts <e> <s> the government intend to bring forward amendments at committee stage in the other place to facilitate this <e> <s> in bringing forward an amendment it will be necessary to ensure that where one of the bodies in an amalgamation is already a recognised body the objects of the reconstituted body would continue to be such <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall check that point and see what the context is <e> <s> undoubtedly the point made by the noble lord is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond briefly to the variety of points made <e> <s> concerning may and shall we shall come to a separate amendment on that later and i shall leave it until then <e> <s> similarly i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord macaulay said about affirmative and negative resolutions <e> <s> this related particularly to his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that we leave the matter to be dealt with when we reach that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because i am concerned that there may be those who would carry out executry services in scotland without there being any control over them that this new scheme was introduced by the government <e> <s> it followed the representations made during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply briefly <e> <s> i am sorry if the grouping is not considered satisfactory but i believe that there is at least some link between the two <e> <s> as my noble friend lady carnegy mentioned we appear to have ranged widely from the matter of setting up the board to the complaints of the farmers and students of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the noble earl would read what i said <e> <s> i have already indicated that if the secretary of state were to make any grant to the board and he may not his powers would be discretionary <e> <s> the grant would be subject to specified terms and conditions which could include a requirement for repayment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are almost rattling around the circle line for a second time <e> <s> i must tell noble and learned lords who have contributed to the debate that it appears to me that what they are saying depends on making a number of assumptions which may well be right <e> <s> it may well be that all the major banks in scotland will immediately seek to become involved in conveyancing practitioner work <e> <s> it may be that all the building societies and other financial institutions similarly wish to take advantage of that competitive opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i do not wish to prejudge too precisely the content of the code <e> <s> that is a matter for the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> however if at that stage he considers that the contents of the code are insufficient and it is important that we should have consultations i shall look seriously at introducing the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> that would appear to be consistent with the line taken by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in the courts and legal services bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting debate on what is undoubtedly an important part of the bill <e> <s> perhaps i can deal first with a number of matters raised by my noble friend lord gray of contin before turning to the specific provisions of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the grouping of these amendments i believe i have already made my views clear <e> <s> however perhaps i may tell the noble and learned lord lord morton that it was precisely his observation that there might be perfectly reasonable circumstances where there is nothing wrong in one solicitor or conveyancing practitioner acting for both sides that underlined my concern about writing such a matter on to the face of the bill <e> <s> i repeat i consider that clearly there are circumstances which should be spelt out in which there would be an unacceptable conflict of interests if a conveyancing practitioner were to act for both parties <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may comment briefly on that <e> <s> the issue would emerge in this way <e> <s> if after consultation some representation was made that the list of exceptions as applied to conveyancing practitioners was to be shorter or indeed longer than that applied to the law society one would have to consider very carefully what the exceptional circumstances were that brought about the difference <e> <s> i envisage that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland would take as his starting point on conflict rules the rule which applies to the law society of scotland <e> <s> that does not bind him in any sense to provide for that in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords having given those previous indications i hope that i too can deal with the amendment briefly <e> <s> in view of what has happened in the courts and legal services bill as has been fairly pointed out by the noble lord lord macaulay it would appear to me appropriate that these regulations ought to be subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> i give that undertaking that that should be the case <e> <s> however i am not prepared to accept the amendment as it stands on the undertaking that it will be brought forward in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the comparable provisions that apply to solicitors in scotland which admit the possibility of imprisonment and the arguments about the level playing field <e> <s> i am not convinced that the quality of treatment would necessarily require the use of the scottish solicitors model <e> <s> the parallel provisions for english solicitors and licensed conveyancers provide only for fines <e> <s> i intend to bring forward an amendment on thursday which will remove the penalty for imprisonment for offences under the solicitors act <e> <s> i can do so in view of the schedules attached to the bill <e> <s> it is a more sensible step that preserves that legendary level playing field <e> <s> in those circumstances i invite the noble and learned lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the house to resist the amendments <e> <s> they would have the effect of paralysing the governments intention that providers should be able to offer conveyancing services and undertake confirmation work for their clients <e> <s> our policy is to increase choice and one way in which we wish to do this is by allowing financial institutions to provide a straight through service to clients in house purchase and executry services <e> <s> we do not pretend that the services will be identical to those offered by solicitors although the amendments will also severely restrict the capacity of solicitors to earn income from services related to conveyancing <e>", "<cs> my lords i admire the confidence with which the noble and learned lord addressed the two amendments on the difficult issue of the registration of deeds in the registers of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look at this <e> <s> i understood that what was being put forward was in the context of the imprisonment provision <e> <s> that may be a misunderstanding on my part of what was being proposed <e> <s> i thought that it had been covered by what i said in relation to amendment <e> <s> i shall have to come back to the noble and learned lord on this <e>", "<cs> my lords in debating amendment no <e> <s> i thought that we were covering amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i indicated that on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at the groupings i had understood that we were discussing this amendment along with amendment no <e> <s> which was subsequently withdrawn <e> <s> in any event i do not think that i have anything to add to what i said in relation to amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the only comment i have to make on this amendment is that following shortly i have amendment no <e> <s> which i consider in a slightly improved fashion covers the same point <e> <s> i think that the point at issue is precisely the same and on that basis i would invite the noble and learned lord to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that this amendment seeks to give effect to a matter which was discussed during committee stage namely that named publicity for decisions of the discipline tribunal should be mandatory only in cases where the solicitor was found guilty of professional misconduct or of providing an inadequate professional service <e> <s> i indicated in moving a comprehensive amendment about the procedures of the discipline tribunal that i wished to look again at this question <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the bill i am not in the business of making my intentions opaque <e> <s> i had thought that the noble and learned lord would appreciate that what i propose in amendment no <e> <s> is intended to cover the matter which i undertook to take away when we discussed it in committee <e> <s> the latter amendment provides <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to say that the noble and learned lord is correct <e> <s> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i was also dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the noble and learned lord may recollect from his knowledge of the guide for the faculty of advocates to which i have already referred that in it not only is an order of precedence for the courts set out but in a subsequent paragraph the types of circumstances are spelt out where one would not necessarily follow that order of precedence <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not envisage the word instructions in this context to be a term of art that applied only to advocates <e> <s> however i shall ask the law society of scotland whether it envisages any difficulty in determining what the word instructions amounts to <e> <s> if the matter needs to be looked at again it can be dealt with in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not envisage that the law society of scotland will stand on its head the order of precedence of the courts in scotland <e> <s> indeed the order of precedence of courts is a matter extending beyond the jurisdiction of the scottish courts into europe <e> <s> there is such an order of precedence set out in the guide of the faculty of advocates <e> <s> i have referred to that <e> <s> i envisaged that the law society would follow that guide <e> <s> frankly i cannot imagine any circumstances in which the law society is likely to depart from that established order of precedence <e> <s> however it is important that that should be set out in rules for the benefit of a new practitioner who may have had little experience of these matters <e> <s> in any event if there is any risk of the law society going off the rails in this matter i can only repeat the point that the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna made earlier which is that the rules would be subject to the approval of the lord president <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a point which has been raised before <e> <s> it is one on which i believe the law society of scotland is unduly sensitive <e> <s> the society is required to make rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to make any firm undertaking on the subject <e> <s> the impositions on the faculty of advocates where someone wishes to secure the services of an advocate are very stern indeed <e> <s> if the law society of scotland is prepared to accept that its members are to be given rights of audience it should not enjoy any lesser duty <e> <s> possible seems to me to be an appropriate test <e> <s> if in very rare circumstances there were difficulties i have to say so be it <e> <s> the rights of audience are to be the same as those given to members of the faculty of advocates <e> <s> however i shall reflect on the matter so long as that is not taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not conscious that i had finished moving the amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the expressions about the last provision in clause it might be appropriate to break for dinner after this amendment <e> <s> if i understand the groupings correctly the noble and learned lord was also speaking to the comparable provision in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but i believe that the noble and learned lord made a slip because he indicated that the secretary of state might delay in introducing clause <e> <s> i do not think that i have ever indicated that <e> <s> however i have certainly indicated that to avoid the lord president and the court being over-taxed in those matters the secretary of state would have it in mind to delay the introduction of clause <e> <s> that is why i thought that the noble and learned lord was dealing with both provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view this amendment is unnecessarily restrictive <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey wished to open an attack upon the first line of clause he might reasonably have done so by saying that the words professional or other should be deleted so that the clause simply stated any body may for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has an optimism which at this time of night surprises me <e> <s> he has asked me that question repeatedly <e> <s> i can do no better than repeat again that while i instanced an adoption matter and he has instanced patent agents i did not suggest at committee stage and i do not suggest at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords when this self-same amendment came before the house last time and i indicated that it might end with a question mark i was as appreciative as the noble and learned lord is of the fact that question marks do not appear on the face of a statute <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the nice compliment that the noble and learned lord paid to me as regards an earlier amendment for the way in which it was constructed with some regret i say that i cannot see what this amendment will add to the sense of the clause <e> <s> the clause seems to make perfectly good sense as it is <e> <s> it has been drafted with the standard practice in such matters very much in <e>", "<cs> my lords while i understand the thinking behind the amendment the noble and learned lord will appreciate the fact that given my amendment to which he has referred i cannot accept it <e> <s> the lord president will under the terms of clause consider and approve a draft scheme submitted by a professional or other body wishing to accord rights to conduct litigation or rights of audience to its members <e> <s> notwithstanding what the noble and learned lord has said it would be inappropriate and impractical to expect him to consider whether each individual is a fit and proper person to undertake the work involved <e> <s> in my view that task is best undertaken by the body concerned and my amendment no <e> <s> seeks to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords the list of matters to be included in a draft scheme is not exhaustive <e> <s> it is important that the secretary of state should have a long stop power to add further requirements should circumstances develop which demand that <e> <s> i cannot accept that the lord president would be an appropriate person to exercise that task since the breadth of his responsibilities cannot be compared with those of the secretary of state <e> <s> i doubt whether his perspective would fully qualify him to deal with all the matters which a draft scheme will be required to cover <e> <s> i am thinking specifically of the requirements which relate to client protection and complaints <e> <s> i emphasise that it is as a long stop provision that this power is sought to be given to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble and learned lords for raising this matter again <e> <s> as i indicated in committee i am sympathetic to the thinking behind this amendment <e> <s> i have to say however that i do not think a further regulation-making power for the secretary of state is either necessary or appropriate to achieve what is needed here <e> <s> given the recent criticism that some have made of this bill that it gives too many powers <e>", "<cs> my lords although at earlier points during report stage i indicated a willingness to consider reversing matters to require affirmative resolution rather than negative resolution in this area i do not experience the same concern as i remarked in answering earlier amendments i do not envisage that regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord interpreted the signals correctly <e> <s> i propose to accept his amendment <e> <s> i do not even propose to take it away <e> <s> it strikes me as eminently reasonable that the lord president who is responsible for considering the rules of the law society of scotland in relation to the treatment of complaints and indemnity against client loss should have a comparable role for these new providers of legal services <e> <s> moreover it will give the lord president an opportunity to consider the application in its entirety and to assess the implications of one aspect of a scheme for the application as a whole <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for bringing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the anxiety expressed is correct but i shall check that <e> <s> turning to amendments nos <e> <s> and i do not see what can be gained if they were to be accepted <e> <s> it is only fair and reasonable that where a body has an application for rights of audience or rights conduct litigation refused the lord president should give his reasons for so refusing <e> <s> it is in the best interests of openness and accountability and most particularly to allow the applicant body to reconsider its position in the light <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the matter briefly because while it is not precisely the same point the amendment essentially traverses ground that i thought we had covered when i moved amendment no <e> <s> which ensures that standards of conduct and practice among non-lawyer practitioners are maintained <e> <s> as i said then the lord president will undoubtedly pay due regard to the interests of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords on the matter of reciprocity of rights as between scottish advocates and english barristers we shall deal with that point more precisely under clause <e> <s> provisions comparable to clause are in the process of being introduced for england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated during the committees discussion of an identical amendment tabled in the names of the noble lords lord macaulay and lord carmichael i am sympathetic to the idea of a review power for rules which have received the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> i accept that i undertook to consider the matter further <e> <s> i regret that it has taken me longer to do so than i had envisaged since i now wish to intertwine the aim of this amendment with a more general provision to enable the secretary of state for scotland and the lord president to instigate a review of certain rules where they consider that to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> before dinner i indicated that i thought amendment no <e> <s> would be coupled with it <e> <s> however i appreciate that it is not <e> <s> i have already had my tail twisted about this provision not once twice or three times but now for the fourth time <e> <s> i doubt whether there is any way that i can elaborate on the provision that will satisfy the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i shall have to leave my arguments where they rest <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important opportunity to explain an important matter <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord wishes to ensure that the right of a person to receive legal aid in respect of proceedings in the high court should be protected <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that there is no intention that the provisions of clauses and should act in a restrictive way <e> <s> indeed the purpose of the provisions is to extend choice <e> <s> i can see however that there is a case for considering statutory provision to ensure that legally-aided persons will not be confined to using representatives from one professional group rather than another for what might be seen as improper reasons <e> <s> we shall of course need to retain control in the area of legal aid over the sanctioning of counsel in the lower courts which has existed for a very long time or the use of silks whether advocates or in future solicitors <e> <s> by contrast however i do not see that the issue is confined to criminal matters <e> <s> i shall take this away to reflect on what might best be done and i hope that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment in the light of that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has made that point before <e>", "<cs> my lords i had already sat down <e> <s> i really cannot go over the matter again <e> <s> as i have indicated we are acting in discharge of directive matters <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will appreciate what obligations are incumbent on us and will consider these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the first of these amendments seeks to delete from the bill a provision for which there is an equivalent in the courts and legal services bill to permit those who have been accorded rights of audience in england and wales and northern ireland but who are not barristers or solicitors to acquire rights to practise in scotland <e> <s> although i have already indicated that these provisions are intended essentially to cover what are covered in two separate ec directives the provision about defining a practitioner goes beyond what is required under those directives <e> <s> the purpose is to acknowledge that rights gained in other jurisdictions within the united kingdom by non-lawyers might be extended in such a way as to allow them to appear in scotland <e> <s> i should be most reluctant to delete the scottish part of what is in effect a reciprocal provision <e>", "<cs> my lords we have yet another version of the cab rank rule and it looks very different to the one that i understand is proposed for the courts and legal services bill <e> <s> from the brief interventions there were from members of the legal profession on this side of the border when we considered this matter at committee stage one point came through very clearly <e> <s> although it is sometimes described as a single rule of the cab rank we are often speaking of very different matters certainly from the point the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey made earlier that practitioners of the scottish bar are expected to be generalists <e> <s> from what i understood of what was said on the english bill that provision is nothing like so extensive <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view this amendment is unnecessary as there is a definition of an advocate to be found in clause which slates that an advocate is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to accept the amendment as it stands <e> <s> i agree in principle with the noble and learned lord in the greater part of the amendment except as it relates to employees of conveyancing and executry practitioners <e> <s> i believe it is right that members and officers of the board together with principals partners and directors or senior staff of conveyancing and executry practitioners should not be eligible for appointment as the scottish legal services ombudsman <e> <s> however i do not think it is necessary to extend the restriction to all employees of practitioners <e> <s> this approach would be consistent with existing requirements with respect to the lay observer <e> <s> solicitors and advocates may not be appointed as lay observers but the restriction does not extend to the employees of a solicitor however unlikely it might be that such an employee might be appointed to that post <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the noble and learned lord on this occasion as i listened to him when we dealt with precisely the same matter on an earlier occasion <e> <s> i recognise that at least in recent years those advocates nominated for appointment as court of session judges have practised for years or more at the bar <e> <s> in view of that it might appear that the present statutory provision for a period of five years is indeed unrealistically low <e> <s> given what i acknowledge is the practice i can see the logic of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the opportunity in our debate to discuss an amendment to leave out subsection of clause and to consider the appointment of outer house judges to the inner house <e> <s> it may be of assistance for me to explain the reasoning with regard to clause b to which the present amendment would refer <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the house to resist this amendment which would put my right honourable friend the secretary of state under a statutory duty which on one interpretation appears very onerous and yet on closer inspection might appear to be so general as to be meaningless <e> <s> my right honourable friend is already very active in securing the broad availability of legal services in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the interest shown by the noble lord in this matter is very much appreciated <e> <s> i should say that i am in sympathy with the intentions which lie behind the amendment <e> <s> as he said it is a most important matter <e> <s> however i am not persuaded that the amendments as drafted fully address the difficulties which he so rightly highlighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely concur with that observation <e> <s> i should have thought there was no one in this house who did not regard the institution of marriage as a contract that ought to be entered into in the belief that it will last for life <e> <s> however the difficult issue here arises where the high hopes that may have been there at the beginning of a marriage do not last <e> <s> we must decide how we wish to see an unsuccessful marriage brought to an end and after what length of time <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey rightly observed i accept i said this at the time whatever periods are chosen are necessarily arbitrary within a certain range <e> <s> as the noble earl lord selkirk said there can be nothing absolute about the periods recommended <e> <s> indeed the scottish law commission acknowledged at the commencement of its report that it had received and considered comments which encompassed a wide spectrum of views <e>", "<cs> my lords if the amendment were to be carried because there is provision in clause which removes the ground of desertion a deserted spouse would not be able to bring the marriage to an end after two years but would only be able to do so after three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am hot aware of any particular representation to the effect that as a church it is opposed to the proposals <e> <s> however i am aware that some sincere individual members of the church of scotland and a number of kirk sessions have expressed concern <e> <s> i do not know the extent to which they have examined the careful reasoning which lay behind the scottish law commissions proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the most complete answer in terms of admission of the facts that the crown would always be pleased to receive would be a section letter containing a plea of guilty <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated at committee when the same amendment was moved by the noble and learned lord lord morton i have considerable sympathy with the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> i entirely appreciate the difficulties that the noble and learned lord has so eloquently set out as arising in such cases <e> <s> i have previously indicated that i thought it would be preferable to await the recommendations of the scottish law commission which is considering the matter as part of its fourth programme of law reform <e> <s> i mentioned comparatively recently my interest in it and that i agreed with it <e> <s> it may be that the attitude that i have taken on these matters is too conservative in wishing to ensure that the law is not amended in a piecemeal fashion or a fashion that makes the achievement of the longer term reform more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall respond briefly to the noble and learned lords remarks <e> <s> i heard clearly what he said about the extra division and agree that an extra division sits almost permanently in order to deal with either civil or criminal cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the way in which he presented his amendment on this important matter <e> <s> it must be clear that in present circumstances and in view of the changes which the noble and learned lord so carefully outlined it is right that the element of automaticity in the existing arrangements for the appointment of inner house judges is no longer appropriate <e> <s> a change is clearly required if the policy is to be adopted that in respect of each judicial vacancy the best fitted individual for that vacancy is selected <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal separately with the two effects of this amendment <e> <s> as regards the first i see no justification to retain a lawyers monopoly over writs relating to moveable estate <e> <s> there is no clear evidence that the monopoly is in practice exercised <e> <s> moreover the preparation of the writs in question some of which may i acknowledge be complex is not normally of concern to private individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords before turning to the amendments which are most anxiously awaited i shall respond briefly to what has been said <e> <s> it needs to be recalled that in another place the bill was given unopposed second and third readings <e> <s> approximately hours were taken in committee in another place scrutinising the bill <e> <s> in such circumstances the complaint that it has been too briefly considered is unwarranted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord indicated that delays arose only from this side of the house <e> <s> i and everyone else was prepared to go ahead <e> <s> however the request was made and it was acceded to <e> <s> it is ungracious to indicate that all the delay was caused by this side of the house when the postponement of one day in committee was intended to assist the noble and learned lord and the law society of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the new clause was introduced in response to an amendment tabled in another place to require banks to identify accounts of recognised bodies which had lain unused and to require the inland revenue to list such bodies <e> <s> the object was to allow moribund charitable funds to be brought back into use <e> <s> this principle was warmly supported and the government undertook to explore with the banks how such monies might be brought back into charitable use <e>", "<cs> my lords although there has been complaint about the time at which this measure has come before the house i am grateful that such a broad welcome has been given to the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is a drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clause makes provision that for the purposes of any proceedings under part i of the bill a certificate by a person authorised to do so by the commissioners of inland revenue shall be conclusive evidence of that fact that the revenue have recognised the body as a charity <e> <s> the government accepted a suggestion in another place that the word sufficient would be preferable <e> <s> conclusive was thought to be final sufficient would permit the test of sufficiency which would be consistent with other legislation hence this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clause defines the expression non-recognised body <e> <s> the subsection was criticised in another place on the grounds that the number of negatives in the clause was confusing <e> <s> the amendment is a drafting amendment which avoids the use of multiple negatives <e> <s> the amendment at clause is consequential <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clause deals with non-recognised bodies <e> <s> subsection provided that it would be an offence for a non-recognised body to represent itself or hold itself out as a charity and would be liable to a fine and/or

themselves on the wrong side of the law by describing themselves as charities without having obtained recognition for tax purposes from the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the structure of different denominations within the christian faith and others faiths varies very widely

more importantly the lord president of the court of session will want to promote the proper and efficient administration of justice if he does not i do not know why he is in the chair i should have thought that that was such an underlying part of his role that what we provided for in clause in saying that he should put together a scheme which will achieve and ensure maintenance of appropriate standards of conduct and practice by persons was sufficient to meet the ends <e> <s> i regret to have to say to the noble and learned lord that if he presses the amendment i cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has been insistent on this point and has asked the question not once or twice but many times <e> <s> as i indicated in dealing with matters at the outset when i assumed we would deal with these amendments together the specific provision he now seeks to delete is in precisely the same form as it was when it left this house albeit in another clause <e>",

that left this house <e> <s> what we have done i hope it is clearer now is to set out the scheme in clauses so that it is more comprehensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i have made it clear to the noble and learned lord that i recognise that the lord president has a right under subsection to request the suspension of an individual <e> <s> that is a different situation <e> <s> where disciplinary proceedings are to be properly carried out by the body it is not unreasonable as an interim measure for him to request the suspension of an individual <e> <s> however the actual determination of whether a disciplinary offence has been committed by an individual is properly a matter for the body to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already touched on this matter in dealing with the previous amendment <e> <s> there is a fundamental disagreement between us on how these matters ought to proceed but there is nothing illogical here <e> <s> if the lord president has brought to his attention an allegation of gross professional misconduct it would seem entirely appropriate that he should have the power to go to the body and request it to suspend the individual until it has determined whether or not there has been a disciplinary offence <e> <s> in a number of areas people are suspended prior to a determination of a complaint against them <e> <s> it seemed appropriate to the government that in these circumstances the lord president as the senior judge in scotland should be given that opportunity to require the suspension <e> <s> it does not follow that where the suspension is requested pending the determination of a complaint he should be the person to determine that complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat the point that i have already made <e> <s> if one looks at clause as it existed in the bill when it left your lordships house with only one exception it is identical to the provision that is now to be found in subsection <e> <s> the only amendment is one that was insistec on by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> it has been accepted by the government as being appropriate namely that it is not for this body to establish the order but to state it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his intervention <e> <s> i was about to conclude my remarks by pointing out that this matter first arose in relation to clause <e>

that this order of precedence was set out <e> <s> as i understand it when it left the house there was no concern or disagreement about it and no indication was given at that time that we had in any way set out the provision so that the drafting was defective <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not accept even now that there is anything defective in the drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment provides for rights of audience or rights to conduct litigation to be brought to an end on the initiative

volition <e> <s> it may wish to do so for a variety of reasons <e> <s> changes in the law or in the commercial climate may render the rights unnecessary or simply unviable <e> <s> moreover the members of a body may simply decide that they wish to change the way in which it operates <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not very much that i can say by way of expansion <e> <s> if the body itself wishes to wind up the right to conduct litigation which is to lose its rights of audience it would seem appropriate that it should do so as a whole <e> <s> i can only repeat that if it is the case of an individual or individuals who wish to leave the body and surrender their rights of audience it would seem to be a matter entirely between them and the body which governs their activities <e>", "<cs>

sederunt following consultation with the dean of the faculty of advocates that because my instructions were given to me on a speculative basis my fee will be increased by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the act of sederunt would not say here is fee a and in these circumstances you can now have an excessive fee <e> <s> the provision states that if an advocate undertakes speculative work there will be circumstances in which he recovers nothing <e> <s> but in certain circumstances because he is prepared to take the risk that he will receive no fee if he be successful the act of
