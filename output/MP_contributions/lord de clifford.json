["<cs> my lords it is a great honour to address your lordships today <e> <s> first i should like to address myself to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack because it was years ago this year that i first addressed your lordships house under the noble and learned lords father who was kindness itself towards me and to whom i shall always be eternally grateful <e> <s> secondly i shall address myself to some subjects which i believe are covered by the following phrase in the gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord tanlaw for raising this matter <e> <s> i raised it myself on the debate on the gracious speech <e> <s> today i shall not go into the policies of who does what to the coal industry or anything like that <e> <s> i want to ask my noble friend the minister whether he can state in clear words words which can be understood by people in the country what will happen over the course of the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell me if and when an occasion like this has arisen before <e> <s> i have been some time in your lordships house some years and it would be interesting to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak very briefly because i am not in the high ranks of those people who understand these items of modern equipment <e> <s> i started my life with the army in the territorial army in and that was then a very enthusiastic collection of soldiers to which we had no difficulty in recruiting <e> <s> but we were woefully under-equipped in those days even right up to the last war <e> <s> whatever else the government do with the tavr i would ask them to keep their equipment up to the most modern standards <e> <s> i can well remember it must have been somewhere round about riding down the road in armoured cars with solid wheels with another yeomanry regiment galloping alongside on their horses shouting we are firing at you with machine guns as they waved their flags <e> <s> it was pathetic so please can we have an assurance that the territorial army volunteer reserve will always be kept equipped with the most modern weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords five years if he is lucky <e> <s> therefore even if our noble friend is not prepared to do something about this problem now perhaps we can look forward to something being done about it within the next few years <e>", "<cs> my lords before i address your lordships i should like to offer an apology to the noble earl for not being present when he made his speech and to the other noble lords whom i unfortunately did not hear because of the rather inclement weather that i encountered on my way here <e> <s> having said that i shall not detain your lordships unduly <e> <s> it would be ill of me <e>", "<cs> my lords before i begin my remarks i should like to thank the noble lord lord paget of northamp <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he is aware that it is two years since i last asked this question and apparently for two years we have had no answer <e> <s> is he aware that the matter is serious because today for the first time the air was flooded with warnings about spray on motorways <e> <s> is it not a fact i have no doubt my noble friend will correct me if i am wrong that on the continent there are regulations about this matter and that in america they have advanced in their research to the extent that they are putting a form of sponge under wheels which i understand reduces the spray considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords without taking much more time of the house may i point out that when i last asked this question i was told that research was being undertaken into the subject of road surfaces which is one of the matters which caused the greatest hazard <e> <s> can the noble lord give the house any information as to results on that matter <e>", "<cs> may i say at this stage that my noble friend lord skelmersdale and i felt very strongly about the bill and i must confess that i still do but i totally appreciate the reason why it is inappropriate that we should go on with it <e> <s> there are certain basic points in the bill that i do not like <e> <s> one point which made me very reluctant to agree with my noble friend was the fact that one of the propositions that we wanted to include here related to the method by which these wild animals were taken <e> <s> i considered this matter rather carefully and i thought that in view of the fact that the government were not immediately producing a wildlife bill this would be a moment when we could perhaps put a little pressure on them <e> <s> i fully appreciate what my noble friend has said and i do not propose to go any further with it <e> <s> however i trust that the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton will consider that we might advance a little in the protection of our wildlife and give more haste to the new wildlife bill that is coming <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to address you in particular on how this question of civil defence affects rural areas <e> <s> it appears to me that it does not particularly matter whether we have nuclear or conventional assaults on our major urban areas as to what happens there <e> <s> i feel very deeply that we must realise that the future of our country lies in its children <e> <s> prior to the last war we had a great mass evacuation of children and i hope that in any immediate threat of future war we shall be able to do something to take away from these danger areas where the mass of our industry is the children who will have to reconstruct the future of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i also must thank the noble marquess for raising this subject which is one that is very dear to my heart <e> <s> i can perhaps introduce another part of rural england and that is the border counties of wales <e> <s> the vital part of this closing down of schools is in fact that when you close a school you condemn a village to its death <e> <s> the county council come along and offer free bussing to the local school just for the time that the pupils who are there are still attending school <e> <s> anybody who comes in after that will have to pay <e> <s> as the noble lord lord polwarth said this discourages any new person from coming in because they have to educate their children <e> <s> also in these border counties where the weather can be extremely rough they do not want to expose their children to the hazards of the morning and evening movement <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that when he comes down to adjusting the law on dogs as there are to acts which affect them it would be better if he took some time to adjust them all and produced an answer which was enforceable as opposed to the situation at the present time when none of the operating acts is being enforced adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to address your lordships very briefly at this late hour on a matter which has been worrying me for some years <e> <s> after the war when i was in the royal electrical and mechanical engineers every time we had a cut in manpower we were given in replacement a civilian <e> <s> that built up very considerably over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a most daunting position as i am opposed to the bill <e> <s> i have the utmost sympathy for mr berry and mrs ward and i fully understand and comprehend everything which has caused them to ask your lordships to pass this personal bill <e> <s> but behind it we are doing something which in my view and i submit that your lordships should consider it this house has already in principle rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply and appreciate that we have been having rather peculiar weather lately <e> <s> but is he aware that in the border counties of wales and england the water has just managed to get down to the potato level <e> <s> is he also aware that if we get a shortage in the future there may be great difficulties in these areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking the minister for these two orders <e> <s> may i also join with other noble lords in saying that while these are very good orders they form only part of what is required for the protection of deer in this country <e> <s> it would also be most interesting to many people who are interested in deer to know exactly where the forestry commission stand in regard to this matter <e> <s> the commission has many hundreds of deer on its property <e> <s> can the commissions activities be considered as farming <e> <s> it would be most interesting to know <e> <s> i wish to ask the government most earnestly whether they cannot within the next few sessions produce a really comprehensive deer bill which would absorb all the orders that are now being brought into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out to the noble lord that the subject of refugees appears to have been omitted from the statement <e> <s> in areas on the edge of this subject there is great worry <e> <s> perhaps at some future date the noble lord could elucidate on it <e> <s> secondly in any further matters put forward will he please include elucidation on how farmers should handle their animals and whether contaminated animals can be milked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to detain the house for a few moments and i must particularly apologise to the noble earl lord mansfield that i have to raise these points at this moment <e> <s> somehow or other this bill escaped me when it went through this house earlier and it is only since a number of alarmed citizens have drawn my attention to certain parts of the bill that i have wished to ask him to elucidate them <e> <s> i am referring of course as is my usual wont to the control of dogs <e>", "<cs> may i also support this amendment <e> <s> this is a young industry and is one which should be encouraged <e> <s> this is a government who i hope will encourage young industries and all forms of exploration into the provision of jobs and if we can do anything to encourage a young industry like this we should do so <e> <s> it would benefit the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord who is moving the passage of this bill <e> <s> i have heard from his noble friend who i regret to hear is ill and he has answered all the points that i raised at the report stage <e> <s> it is now up to citizens of dundee to ensure that what they want is carried out <e>", "<cs> i will not take up your lordships time for very long <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton wants clause taken out this has to do with night shooting <e> <s> i have heard my noble friend lord long reading a splendid brief which he was given quoting acts of parliament from here there and everywhere <e> <s> i am not approaching it from that point of view <e> <s> i think the night use of firearms should be forbidden and i must say it is purely from personal experience <e> <s> it is the most surprising business when you are walking about your own small acreage at about nine oclock at night to suddenly get yourself translated back years and to find a couple of bullets whistling past your ear which have been <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he tell us who he considers to be a qualified person <e> <s> secondly would he at a later stage consider taking out rifles <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard was not present to move the relevant amendment but i ask my noble friend whether he would consider that <e>", "<cs> once again i must agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that the use of rifles at night is absolutely wrong <e> <s> one cannot tell who is using them <e> <s> for the noble lord to say that only qualified persons can use them is quite unrealistic in the country <e> <s> during the holiday period the sons of farmers take the guns which they find in their fathers houses and those include rifles <e> <s> i told your lordships earlier that i was at the receiving end of some shots which surprised me very considerably but i could not tell who had fired them <e> <s> i could tell roughly where the shots came from and i had a good idea as to who had fired them but there was no method of proving it <e> <s> the use of rifles at night is absolutely wrong and i trust that the mover of the bill will reconsider it and at a later stage allow us to prohibit the use of rifles once and for all <e>", "<cs> the mover of the bill has not said whether he would consider banning rifles for use at a later stage so that we might consider it <e> <s> he must come down to the ground on this issue <e> <s> it is fine in this place to talk about people shooting at night <e> <s> however out in the country it is probable that one policeman has to cover or square miles <e> <s> how is he going to stop a boy swiping a rifle at night from his father for example a and going out and shooting <e> <s> the locals can lay a complaint against him and them something can be done but we cannot rely on the police <e> <s> the police are paralysed in enforcement as in so many acts of parliament <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will reconsider this business and that we shall have a banning of rifles at night <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also support this amendment <e> <s> this is a young industry which needs every encouragement <e> <s> its future is absolutely vital to the food supplies of this country and it is an industry on which we may well have to rely in times of crisis <e> <s> this matter has been going on for a number of years now and it is about time it was settled <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i say that if we give the bill a third reading i have the feeling that if we then accept any of the amendments the bill will be lost <e> <s> we have here a bill which some noble lords think is bad while other noble lords think it is good <e> <s> in this house we are being virtually told whether we like it or not pass this bill <e> <s> do not amend it or it is lost <e> <s> i can well remember being told precisely the same thing about a horrible bill called the breeding of dogs bill and like a twit i accepted what i was told <e> <s> that bill should have been lost <e> <s> if noble lords in this house feel that this bill should be lost then they must amend it or reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i had some of the eloquence of a number of noble lords who have spoken tonight <e> <s> i am happy to follow my noble cousin lord clifford because we follow very much the same line of thought <e> <s> one of the things which it is difficult for people to appreciate and i trust that noble lords who are answering for the government or speaking from any side must realise it is that there are people out in the country and have been during all your lordships debate who are in fact being taxed and who are contributing towards the defence of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i always thoroughly enjoy hearing the noble earl lord halsbury who advances extremely good arguments for whatever he is discussing <e> <s> but i am afraid that on this matter i am of the opposite opinion <e> <s> i do not think that we should have seat belts <e> <s> my basic objection to any order under this bill is that it will not be enforced <e> <s> i have driven miles today on various forms of roads and i have seen practically every law of motoring broken and not a soul got touched for it <e> <s> if you legislate that people will wear seat belts who is going to enforce it <e> <s> it is all very well for noble lords to <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to join the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley in welcoming the bill <e> <s> it is one which is greatly needed <e> <s> there are many others particularly to do with dogs which are not within sight <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he come away from club row and all those places <e> <s> what is the position in the normal regular market <e> <s> is that a public place in a rural market <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have a rather nasty mind <e> <s> if i were in an open air or a permanent market and was selling a dog for instance a collie a terrier or any form of gun dog and i was told that i could <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to address your lordships mainly because i have great depths of feeling about the matter <e> <s> first however with other noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment moved by lord stanley <e> <s> this is probably one of the most important amendments regarding sheep farming and hill farming <e> <s> i am very pleased to read in the proposed subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak because i live in a deeply rural area which for some years now has found life becoming increasingly difficult <e> <s> when we consider the cost of petrol we have to go back a few years to when the price was suddenly raised by opec <e> <s> that decision caused considerable trouble in the rural areas particularly in areas such as that in which i live <e> <s> people in the rural areas in particular the smallholders lost all their deliveries <e> <s> we used to have our milk delivered but we lost that delivery <e> <s> we used to have food delivered for our birds and animals but we lost that delivery too and we lost much more besides <e> <s> so we had to do it ourselves and that meant spending a considerable amount of money <e>", "<cs> before we go any further i should like to support the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i hope he will press this amendment <e> <s> this is always happening in your lordships house <e> <s> people are urged to withdraw an amendment and recast it and when it is recast they are told that they had better withdraw it again because it is still not right <e> <s> i would invite noble lords to put this amendment into the bill whether the noble lord likes it or not and let him recast it the way he thinks it should be <e> <s> this is happening all the time in this house <e> <s> i trust that the right reverend prelate will press it and i shall be with him all the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the noble lord who has moved this amendment <e> <s> i think that it is eminently reasonable <e> <s> when you live in the country with rights of way crossing your land it is very difficult to make quite sure that dogs do not worry sheep they do <e> <s> the noble lord who said that he lives in the country and does not get dogs belonging to people from the towns worrying sheep amazes me because in my area we do <e> <s> i do not think that there is very much wrong with this amendment <e> <s> your lordships wholeheartedly supported a similar amendment when it was last moved and i think that my noble friend has done exactly what was wanted and has tried to meet the points raised on that occasion <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while my feelings are rather divided on the matter i feel that i must support the noble lord lord houghton on the bill <e> <s> i am happy to speak following the noble baroness lady stedman because on many occasions we have crossed swords across the floor of the house but tonight it is delightful to find myself on the same side with her <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont said there was a large matter of conscience involved in the issue and that people expressed their consciences in different ways <e> <s> my conscience is wholeheartedly behind the bill and i cannot understand the attitude of people who point to the eec as being a difficulty in relation to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply but it would be interesting to know what are the other safeguards because the customs men are withdrawing their labour <e> <s> what are the other safeguards <e> <s> which is the basis of my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the house for not being in my place earlier on <e> <s> i should particularly like to apologise to the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> some distance away i was exercising my inalienable right to vote which was a greater pleasure because i did not have a whip standing by my shoulder telling me how to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i point out that she was slightly inaccurate in what she said <e> <s> i opposed the berry and ward bill <e> <s> i also stated at the time that the noble baroness would use it to introduce another bill <e> <s> is the noble baroness also telling us that the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i will intervene for only a very short period in this debate but i should like to join with other noble lords in welcoming this bill which has been so ably introduced by the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> on some occasions i do not find myself in tune with propositions put forward by the noble lord lord nugent but on this occasion i do <e> <s> i think this is a very good bill <e> <s> it is unfortunately one of these bills which have to be introduced to deal with a subject which apparently has to be dealt with little by little rather like a caterpillar eating a leaf <e> <s> this aspect goes right throughout many phases in this country mainly because the government will not take a deep breath and dive in and do something <e> <s> when all these bills come before your lordships house whatever they may be we always come back to the question of enforcement <e> <s> there are bills of every kind which if they were enforced would be such a help to stop nuisances and other things taking place <e> <s> i hope that when this bill does become law as no doubt it will enforcement will be undertaken on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he would agree that it comes down to this that an animal which is stolen may go for research while one taken under legislation may not <e> <s> is it not a most extraordinary situation that an animal stolen may go for research while an animal collected as a stray may not <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with this amendment <e> <s> i think it is highly desirable that motor-cyclists should use their headlamps <e> <s> i am not very much in favour of motor-cyclists because in traffic they do some extraordinary things which so far as i can see are masterpieces of knitting <e> <s> the question i should like to put to the noble baroness is this <e> <s> what happens in respect of mopeds <e> <s> not all mopeds have a method of producing light when they are stationary <e> <s> it would be practically impossible for this provision to be applied to all mopeds for example when they stop at traffic lights <e> <s> their lights would go out and they would just have to treat their mopeds as if they were bicycles and push them <e> <s> this matter should be looked at again with regard to mopeds but apart from that i am entirely in favour of the proposal <e>", "<cs> i must agree with the principle of both these amendments <e> <s> we may return to the subject of enforcement <e> <s> i may be wrong but i think that these amendments have been drafted with urban areas and with those who travel long distances in mind <e> <s> my mind goes to the lady who collects children <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment as well <e> <s> i have only had one experience of a road hump and i passed it much to the annoyance of a traffic warden before i even knew it was there <e> <s> i was going into a police switch which was a dead end and they had a notice up which was concealed by scaffolding which did not permit us unless we had arrived there before am <e> <s> it would have been simpler had there been a barrier so that one would know what was happening rather than going over a road hump which one did not even notice <e> <s> one of the things that local authorities do not realise at the present moment is what road humps are <e> <s> they put them up generally at a height which they think makes a hump <e> <s> in this case there was no hump <e> <s> but a barrier like this would have produced the right result without having to go to the expense of a hump <e>", "<cs> may i support these amendments <e> <s> i will not add anything to what has been said about them but i should like to ask the government when they come to revise the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his reply may i ask whether he is aware that the killing of a child by several guard dogs under training came as a great shock to a number of us <e> <s> is he also aware i think he undoubtedly will be that the noble lord lord gordon-walker and myself envisaged just such a situation when the guard dogs bill went through parliament <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he is also aware as again i think he will be that this act has been in operation for some time and is it not time that it was brought into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to press my noble friend much further but under this licensing provision is it not a fact that any inspections must be paid for at a rate which covers the cost for the local authority and there is no cost to the rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening in the debate without having put my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i wish to join my noble friend in congratulating the noble lord lord mountevans on what i thought was an admirable maiden speech and i look forward to hearing what he has to say on transport matters in the future <e> <s> i too should like to welcome the bill <e> <s> i believe that through district councils the bill could lead to much closer public involvement in the running of the railways <e> <s> that would be particularly valuable in rural areas <e> <s> the links which used to exist between the population and the railways appear to have vanished completely and any measure that will bring closer public involvement in the running of railways would be a very good thing <e> <s> i trust that your lordships will give the bill fair weather <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose this amendment as well <e> <s> i am very touched by the faith that the noble lord lord houghton has that local authorities will act on behalf of the citizen <e> <s> may i give a small example <e> <s> on one occasion i discovered two dead sheep in somebodys water supply so filled with indignation i rushed to the local authority in fact to the environmental health authority and they said how very interesting <e> <s> we cannot do anything about that <e> <s> you will have to proceed under the dogs act <e> <s> i have a feeling that if you go to the local authority you are liable to get an argument like that thrown at you <e> <s> further the basic principle of whittling away citizens rights to my mind is wrong <e> <s> far too many people are trying to do it on every side <e> <s> i stand up for the citizens having a right under common law to do exactly what he considers fit <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to ask him one or two questions <e> <s> i listened with great care to all the facts and figures which the minister rolled out so beautifully <e> <s> while i partially understood them it is very difficult for someone like me who lives in a rural area to explain to people in a slightly aged population how these benefits are made up <e> <s> it would be of great help to everyone if the ministers department could produce in an understandable form the points which he has made <e> <s> it is very difficult to explain them to people <e>", "<cs> i too support the noble lord lord melchett my lords <e> <s> at an earlier stage i expressed hostility to air weapons having had some personal experience of what happens when they are used <e> <s> since we last debated the matter i have had further such experience <e> <s> they are among the most dangerous weapons and unless they are controlled and what is proposed is only a modest amount of control i fear that we shall be opening the floodgates <e> <s> these weapons get more powerful every day <e> <s> it is unbelievable to think of steel tipped pellets going into airguns <e>", "<cs> my lords i have now had the honour of attending your lordships house off and on for some years but i think this is the first occasion on which i have been delighted to welcome a speech the maiden speech of the noble lord lord stodart and regret a speech that of the right reverend prelate the bishop of worcester who is departing <e> <s> i hope we shall hear much more from lord stodart i much regret that we shall not hear much more from the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly bemused at the moment <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord that if we are to have a pattern of district council order whether it is in scotland or england or anywhere else this appears to me to be an extremely good one <e> <s> it is one which i think meets all the requirements
