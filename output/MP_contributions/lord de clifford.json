["<cs> my lords i rise to address you in particular on how this question of civil defence affects rural areas <e> <s> it appears to me that it does not particularly matter whether we have nuclear or conventional assaults on our major urban areas as to what happens there <e> <s> i feel very deeply that we must realise that the future of our country lies in its children <e> <s> prior to the last war we had a great mass evacuation of children and i hope that in any immediate threat of future war we shall be able to do something to take away from these danger areas where the mass of our industry is the children who will have to reconstruct the future of this country <e>"]
