["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that british rail already seem to be in some trouble about replacing their diesel stock specifically the multiple units which run some of the commuter services <e> <s> there is a danger therefore that the fuel shortage might be used as an excuse for cutting down or indeed cutting out some of these services thereby increasing the use of petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the revised scheme will the minister bear in mind that eliminating the cheriton complex as well as the direct london rail link has met most of the objections which sank the previous scheme that is to say financially and environmentally <e> <s> will the noble lord also bear in mind that by doing this the revised scheme becomes more specifically a rail link as opposed to a rail-road link which the previous scheme was and that this might very well fit in with the present energy situation <e>", "<cs> my lords in so ably introducing this debate the noble lord lord walston seemed at one point inadvertently no doubt to be allying himself with the farmer whose motto was said to be nature drop dead <e> <s> being like him engaged in the battle to produce more edible foodstuffs my experience would be that we are trying to bend nature in the direction we want it to go rather than tackling it head on which again in my experience usually ends up with one getting a bloody nose <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister say whether the decision to abandon the line between sheffield and wath indicates that all hope has been given up of recovering the traffic which caused this line to be opened as recently as the s <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords that is the section of line which contains the woodhead tunnel between sheffield and wath <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that the swedish state railways after about a year of <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting and as has just been said wide-ranging debate <e> <s> that is usual in this house <e> <s> i am truly grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and who have spoken so well <e> <s> the hour is late and i do not think it would be appropriate for me to prolong the debate beyond making two points before sitting down <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood i congratulate the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the report being debated today sets out details of the european community rgime for fruit and vegetables which appear somewhat complex <e> <s> i believe that this applies mainly to details such as the method of calculating withdrawal price set out in table which i for one would certainly not pretend to understand at all <e> <s> in essence however i believe that the rgime merits the description of being light which was applied to it by the ministry of agriculture in giving their evidence at least as compared with the common agricultural policy as a whole <e> <s> the reason is that from the very first the community has been in effect self-sufficient in these commodities with the exception of tropical fruits and some temperate produce out of season <e> <s> extension to the south now in progress will enhance this situation <e> <s> there has been no need therefore for target prices calculated to stimulate production and although there have been surpluses the perishable nature of the produce has ensured that there have been no tomato or cauliflower mountains <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> would he not agree that it still is anomalous that a heavy goods vehicle of tonnes pays over in excise licence duty whereas a coach or a hackney carriage of similar weight pays only to <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been pointed out this evening article of the treaty of rome called for a common policy first in agriculture admittedly but secondly in transport <e> <s> it made clear that progress towards these objectives was of the essence in building up the community <e> <s> so far there <e>", "<cs> my lords has not only brought the th birthday of the european community but is also proving to be somewhat of a crisis year <e> <s> by fairly common consent this crisis arises from the predominance of the common agricultural policy in the affairs of the community even though it is only one of the subjects deemed in the treaty of rome to be in need of a common policy <e> <s> this situation traces back to the political facts of life when the community first came into being in that owing to the unfortunate absence of britain at that time the two countries whose interests had most importantly to be considered were germany and france <e> <s> accordingly a basic deal was struck whereby germany gained a great new free trade area for its manufactured goods and france the same for its agricultural produce <e> <s> thus from the start the advent of britain with its efficient agriculture was bound to create problems which have yet to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak tonight i should declare an interest in that i am president of the national council of inland transport <e> <s> it might be worth mentioning in view of what was said earlier by the noble lord lord tordoff that a great number of local authorities in both england and scotland are corporate members of that body <e> <s> i can confirm that their views on transport are of very great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry i should be very glad to oblige the noble baroness but i do not think i can answer that one without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour and at this stage of the debate i have no intention of making a speech <e> <s> however i could not sit down without adding my tribute to the chairmanship of the noble lord lord cledwyn of pen rhos <e> <s> to my mind there is an element of welsh wizardry about the dexterity with which he handles a spirited but not always unanimous team <e> <s> the drafting of the report is a model of its kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that declaration of intent <e> <s> is he aware that spain has a great potential through protective cropping and irrigation to produce fruit and vegetables during the north european season <e> <s> does he agree that if that potential is developed as is being done now it would have a serious effect on jobs in horticulture which is a labour intensive industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations which are the subject of this debate have been presented by the government as though they were a long-needed charter for the proper control of heavy lorries with the hope no doubt that any dissentient voice will either be silenced or else dismissed as being opposed to a package so desirable from an environmental point of view <e> <s> without doubt most of us would agree that reduction in noise better safety regulations more by-passes and taxation related to damage caused are very desirable objectives <e> <s> but they are all very much required in relation to the large fleet of existing -tonne lorries to which in fact very few of the provisions of the package would apply <e> <s> what we are actually being offered are some declarations of intent to sugar the pill of the introduction of the -tonne lorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no wish to detain the house at this point but if i may i will speak very briefly on this private bill <e> <s> i feel i should declare an interest as president of the national council of inland transport <e> <s> let me say at the outset as lord underhill has emphasised that there is no quarrel with the purpose of this bill which is to improve the facilities at present jointly provided by liverpool street and broad street stations <e> <s> equally the method of doing this by providing seven new platforms at liverpool street station at the low level will not only improve the railway operating side of that station but also make it more convenient for the passengers using it <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging that these regulations do a very useful tidying up job on what was previously a rather tangled web i should like to ask the minister whether he would be a little more specific on the philosophy lying behind the raising of the speed limits for coaches and lorries <e> <s> it is i submit extremely doubtful whether public opinion played much part in this matter <e> <s> all we have had is some suggestion that the new limits are more realistic and acceptable to drivers and therefore in some way easier to enforce <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of his committee i should like to join in paying tribute to the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow in steering the committee through what was a rather difficult subject <e>", "<cs> my lords in the foreword to their report the warnock committee make a bow to the role of morality but conclude that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is timely that we should be debating this unstarred question put down by the noble earl lord bessborough a colleague on sub-committee f of the select committee of your lordships house on the european communities <e> <s> the chairman of that sub-committee the noble viscount lord torrington has with regret been prevented from putting his name down to speak <e> <s> that is all the more regrettable since his great-great-uncle the then lord torrington actually went out to sea in the tunnel then being built under the channel with the chairman of the south eastern railway on th september <e> <s> i cannot of course speak for him but i believe he is sorry that it has not yet reached the other side <e> <s> even at that time the idea had been around for years but in all that period the factors involved political financial and technical have never been so favourable at one and the same time <e> <s> so there is a feeling that it is now or never both here and among our partners on the other side of the channel <e>", "<cs> my lords the contents of this bill evidently pose a problem to those who like myself feel that a much more comprehensive bill is needed and soon covering many more of the issues raised by the warnock report <e> <s> on the one hand this bill calls for support on the basis that a crumb is better than no bread <e> <s> on the other its passing into law might serve as an excuse for taking no further action for a very long time <e> <s> i have seen no statements from the government which give any grounds for thinking that there will be any legislation in the life of this parliament for example <e>", "<cs> my lords when the shape of the cap first became known in this country about years ago many people of whom i was one viewed with some scepticism its apparent reliance almost exclusively on price mechanism to regulate both supplies of food for the community and the well-being of the farming industry <e> <s> there was provision for a common external tariff which has limited the sources from which the food supplies of the community could be expected to come but even so the market to be regulated was large and in many respects complex <e> <s> the accession since then of what will shortly be a further six states into the community has greatly increased that complexity and also the political pressures <e>", "<cs> my lords the gratifying amount of support that the bill has received in this house probably represents informed opinion rather accurately <e> <s> however i believe that if a significant part of the general public in this country were to be asked whether a cross-channel fixed link would be a good thing they would probably say yes <e> <s> if one then went on to ask are you in favour of doing it <e> <s> they would either say no or give a grudging reply <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful to point out regarding traffic generated by this proposed terminal that waterloo is essentially a commuter station congested only for relatively short periods in the morning and afternoon <e> <s> any member of the committee who cares to go there during the day will see that it is virtually empty <e> <s> it might be helpful if british rail bore this in mind as i am sure it will in scheduling the international trains at times when the commuter traffic is not at its height <e>", "<cs> while having sympathy with the amendment i do not believe that it is realistic to press it too hard at present because of the hard fact that as the minister has said in commercial terms british rail has to justify any expenditure on this <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the select committee i have nothing to add to what the noble lord lord marshall has said on the question of compensation and the objections that have been raised <e> <s> they were listened to most patiently and ably by the chairman of the committee the noble lord lord nugent and the other members of the committee and we were completely satisfied that the case had not been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in both categories of supporters of the bill as mentioned by the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> moral philosophers she is a most distinguished one seem always to be reluctant to concede that some things are good or bad within themselves because they cannot accept what kant called the categorical imperative <e> <s> however those of us who believe in god find that a decisive way in which to resolve that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the evening i shall concentrate briefly on one point namely that concerning research on embryos <e> <s> the noble and learned lord who introduced the bill carefully put the case for and against and then <e>"]
