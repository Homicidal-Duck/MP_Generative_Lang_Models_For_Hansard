["<cs> i should like to make a brief intervention and i apologise in doing so that i was not in my place last thursday and did not hear what the noble lord lord trefgarne then said <e> <s> when i voted last time for the amendment of the noble lord lord brockway i did so with some misgiving because of the constitutional link then being pro <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government consider introducing experimentally speed-breakers <e> <s> which i have seen working extremely well in new delhi although obviously not on main roads but on other suitable roads <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the apparent apathy of the electorate due to the fact that there were no very clear differences of policy between the candidates <e> <s> did not people therefore vote simply on party lines and were not they really meaningless <e> <s> was not that why many people did not vote at all <e>", "<cs> may i ask a more friendly question <e> <s> are the government bearing in mind the effect on national recovery of the minimum lending rate of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness for attempting to speak when she had risen <e> <s> i merely wanted to make the point that a subsidy for people to buy extra clothes would be equally logical <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether it would not help towards conciliation and the alleviation of suffering if bishop muzorewa were to suspend his embargo for say days in anticipation of peace <e> <s> could not the embargo easily be reimposed if the so-called patriotic front will not soon agree to a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether her majestys government are bearing in mind the agricultural aspect the effect of contamination on grass cattle and crops <e>", "<cs> i should have been very worried about this clause thinking of the skean-dhus which people wear very freely in scotland often in their stockings but i think it is perfectly safe <e> <s> it is only if the police have reasonable grounds that they can carry out this search <e> <s> when the minister replies he might like to say a word about that but i think it is perfectly safe <e>", "<cs> in view of the over-whelming weight of argument in favour of the amendment i wonder whether the government might simply think of accepting it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord skelmersdale has said it is purely permissive and it seems to me that everybody in the committee favours the power being there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his most helpful reply i should perhaps declare my keen personal interest as a grandson of the founder a former trustee and even a signatory aged or of the schedule to the act <e> <s> therefore i am extremely grateful for what my noble friend has said as will be all friends of kenwood in hampstead highgate or london generally <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that noble lords who have supported the amendment have been speaking and i have much sympathy with their view in favour of the provision of milk or meals but the amendment would make it mandatory to have charges <e> <s> it does not make it mandatory to have meals unless i am misunderstanding the amendment and i apologise if i am <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin in his not unsympathetic reply did mention that he would try and find a formula for separating the endowments of the charitable trusts i think he said that <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment proposed my long amendment no <e> <s> does exactly that <e> <s> it takes the value of the endowments and anything built up not now but in before a penny had been received of the hag grants <e> <s> the grants started in <e> <s> it seems to me that avoids all the accounting difficulties because the assets are known at that date <e> <s> it may not be exactly fair that it is not done gradually up to the present date but for rough justice the assets can be taken at that known date before the housing association grants came into it <e> <s> it seems to me that here is the formula the noble lord is looking for <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord consider the temporary use of st georges hospital which i believe stands empty or soon will <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the amendment of my noble friend lady vickers i hope that under this unaccustomed but i hope reasonably stable ceiling i am reasonably audible <e> <s> i will at least be reasonably brief because many of the arguments which i used at the committee stage in moving what is now amendment no <e> <s> apply very much to the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin in foreshadowing the assurances he intends <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the irish ambassador has been good enough to tell me that he considered the proposal a very useful one and thought it would be widely welcomed in the republic <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask whether a stitch in time does not save nine <e> <s> ought not this work to be hurried on as fast as possible during this time when employment is so slack before the boom which we hope is to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree taking a rather different line from that taken by the noble lord lord leatherland that the agricultural aspect in the less thickly-populated parts of the country is extremely important since starvation must follow if all the cattle are dead <e>", "<cs> i wish very briefly to give strong support to the amendment <e> <s> as i understand it if the rupps are again upgraded there is no appeal <e> <s> presumably they will have been downgraded for good reason <e> <s> unless the amendment is passed they can again be upgraded and nobody can say anything about their unsuitability <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord lord bellwin agree that if new evidence of ancient vehicluar rights can be produced the question can come up again and again for years during which time motor cyclists who may not have the rights or perhaps should not have them or perhaps motorcar drivers can go on using the roads <e>", "<cs> i should like to take this opportunity as the noble lord lord bellwin mentioned his understanding of the problems of the farmers and landowners to point out the great hardship the practical hardship that arises to farmers <e> <s> it is not just a matter of not wanting people to go through a field it is having to take the gates down <e> <s> the proper rotation of crops involves grass among corn <e> <s> if there can be no gates the grass cannot be eaten <e> <s> that is a severe practical problem for farmers <e> <s> it is not a question of landowners it is farmers and their gates <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to my impassioned plea <e> <s> people can pass through the gate if it can be opened <e> <s> but if the land is graded up from a bridleway or footpath to a byroad through which motor cars and motor bicycles can go no gate although it can be opened is allowed to be put there <e> <s> that is of very serious concern to the farmer <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his sympathetic reply and for pointing out that speed limits can be imposed but i was suggesting that there should be a presumption of low speed on these highways <e> <s> if the minister is not meeting my point i wonder whether he would look at it again <e> <s> is it not reasonable that on these small green lanes there should be a presumption that there would not be speeding at more than the speed at which a pony cart might travel on which the rights are founded <e> <s> would the minister perhaps undertake to look at it again <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby referred formerly to a quartet and i find myself singing in a duet with him except for one slightly discordant note i think he is not fair on the hunt <e> <s> no hunt is allowed along a bridle path or on any kind of field or path without the consent of the landowner <e> <s> that consent is very often refused <e> <s> what the noble lord is saying is not true of the fox huntsmen since they have to be very courteous in asking for permission otherwise they are barred <e> <s> they take great trouble to get consent from the farmer but that is a side issue <e>", "<cs> i am wondering whether there are two defects in the amendment <e> <s> first the reference to the notice sounds like a piece of paper with something written on it when what the public want is a signpost saying bridlepath or whatever it may be <e> <s> secondly i understood that the whole purpose of this part of the bill was to abolish roads used as public paths and make them either into byways or bridleways and i would have thought therefore that that should be omitted from the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as an ignoramus on this subject perhaps from outside i may make the logical point that it is presumably no fun to shoot any of these three species of bird nobody would do so unless there is a need to reduce their numbers <e> <s> if there is such a need licences have to be applied for involving a great deal of trouble <e> <s> is it not better to leave people to do it when it is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one small point to which i referred in committee <e> <s> if a road has been made into a bridleway farmers will have put up gates and their agricultural practice will have become linked up with that <e> <s> if suddenly the position is reversed the gates will have to be taken down <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am in order in speaking again but this is a different amendment from the one on which i spoke previously <e>

may be a very <e>", "<cs> my lords in discussing this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness in her opposition to the amendment <e> <s> i should like to point out a very odd feature of the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that byways can be gated <e> <s> if anyone left a stallion in a byway it might go to london <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for his reply and also for his assurance that the question is under consideration with the kennet district council would it surprise him to know that there are applicants in the tidworth area of which the council believe this is only a guess on their part that at least would be prepared to take up these houses <e> <s> would it also surprise him to know that the test valley borough council estimate that they could find tenants for or <e> <s> has the noble viscount considered the possibility of selling some of the houses to first-time buyers since they front on to a public road and conceivably making shorter or longer leases of the houses <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government take into consideration the fact that this kind of work gives a great deal of employment <e> <s> does not the cost therefore amount to much less when the employment given is taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the country a great deal of dumping of litter occurs in hedges ditches and fields <e> <s> if some litter bins are provided there is some hope that people may put their litter into them <e>", "<cs> following up with diffidence this complicated question i should like to ask whether a british citizen by descent who takes up a post as a scientist researching for example in the united states or as a professor teaching in a foreign university will be covered or not <e> <s> if he is not covered perhaps it can be put right by registration and so on <e> <s> the difficulty may not be so great <e> <s> however i am very confused and following what my noble friend has just said i should like to ask whether it is only government appointments that will get this exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure us that when considering investment in the railways the benefit to the steel industry is taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to say even a few words on this subject never yet having had the good fortune to go to beverley but i should like to lend my support to what has so excellently been said by the previous speakers <e> <s> i was shocked to see that one of the councillors argued against the ombudsman that he was not infallible <e> <s> my lords which of us is infallible <e> <s> at least by the very nature of his office the ombudsman is unprejudiced and impartial i believe that heed should be given to his views <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting the concern which has been expressed on this subject would the noble lord not agree that there is a very useful to-and-fro traffic in young students learning languages <e> <s> with british students working in hotels abroad and foreign students working in hotels here <e> <s> is that not a useful thing in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his full and very helpful reply which will facilitate public discussion of what is proposed may i ask him to suggest to the postal authorities that they should look again at the possibility of incorporating post offices into the telemessage system so that payment could be made over the counter instead of through call boxes where often adequate change is not available <e> <s> i should also like to ask them to re-examine the possibility of transmitting cash which he kindly says is already being looked at <e> <s> finally will he stress the importance of accurate written confirmatory messages <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is of course essential that the new library should have a reading room there is always a lack of space in reading rooms <e> <s> could not scholars have collections of books on which they are working taken to the reading room of the british museum and find general reference books there so that they have the necessary accommodation for their researches <e> <s> cannot the two things be combined <e>", "<cs> on the point of whether it happens elsewhere in the national gallery of ireland of course we appoint our own chairman <e> <s> it seems the natural thing to do for any board <e>", "<cs> without wishing to take any line on this matter may i ask for clarification whether the trustees of say the national gallery and the british museum are remunerated <e> <s> because if they are not will it not be rather invidious to pay these trustees and not them <e>", "<cs> my lords were not the housing association grants made unconditionally and does not the state have a means of clawing back surpluses through the grant redemption fund which has been discussed at great length in this house <e> <s> is it necessary to have these two things cutting into the work of charitable trusts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an interest to declare in that i have been for over half a century a trustee of the guinness trust but i speak of course in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the trust <e> <s> i wish to confine my few remarks to criticising clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin in opening seemed to lean on the exemptions and to wave away the grievances as though of small consequence but i am told that out of the guinness trusts total of some homes over would be affected by the right to buy a very considerable proportion which is of course a tribute to the efficacy of the grants but also let it not be forgotten to the zeal of the guinness trust staff who like the staffs of other trusts have been of incalculable value in making the grants fructify <e> <s> the state has invested money but the trusts have provided something equally important in the expertise and devotion of their staff <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be wise for diplomataic cars to be clamped until the driver can come to prove his identity and his immunity <e> <s> would it not be probable perhaps i am being ironical that on discussing the matter with the police he being a diplomat and a responsible person would move his car to some sensible and legitimate place <e>", "<cs> my lords because of shortage of time i must confine my few remarks to the future of the kenwood collection in which i naturally take a grandfilial interest <e> <s> since the gallery has been administered first by the lcc and then by its successor the glc <e> <s> i have no criticisms of the way in which the councils have looked after it but only praise for their choice of the three successive and admirable curators who have been

straw without burning it <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down might i ask her whether the young couple she envisaged not being able to find a house because houses were being bought under

size which are a pint and other standard sizes <e> <s> can the noble lord say how to get a quart into a pint pot <e>", "<cs> my lords in returning to the charge in defence of this clause i am bound to repeat myself <e> <s> i consider the proposal constructive imaginative and ingenious <e> <s> in so far as tenants avail themselves of it vacancies will become available for people from charitable housing association waiting lists <e> <s> those moving out will obviously be the better off tenants and the vacancies will be available for younger and less well off applicants <e> <s> the clause is ingenious because purchases will be seen through by non-charitable associations or indeed charitable ones if they wish to do so and are entitled to do so <e> <s> a purchase through an association is important since the association handling the deal will be able to have the property surveyed <e> <s> the minister may like to assure us that vetting of proposed purchases will be part of the function of any housing association in seeing a deal through <e> <s> this has an important bearing on subsequent maintenance <e> <s> concern has been expressed about this and if the property is initially in good condition the new owners <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl comment on a view put forward in a letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for his answer may i ask him whether or not he can endorse the promise of the secretary of state for energy regarding the mining industry

<e> <s> the thin-end-of-the-wedge argument has been thoroughly disposed of the thin end of the wedge has been entirely chipped away <e> <s> the argument is that there would be no strong decisions in the commons <e> <s> but for local elections consensus is the first consideration while deploring like many of my generation the growth of party politics in local government the greater the balance of

council tenants who were bringing the petitions which we know have been handed in i found that some of them thought that their rents would increase under a housing action trust and that therefore they were opposed to it <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be able to set the noble lords mind at rest on these matters <e> <s> as i understand it the fair rent regime will apply for all time to sitting tenants <e> <s> however if i am wrong about that the minister will correct me <e>", "<cs> my lords while the shadow of hungerford is upon us for anyone of my age the shadow of a police state is also upon us <e> <s> although the point about mental instability is perfectly acceptable to put in the hands of a police officer however high his rank the responsibility of judging our characters seems quite unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give general support from these benches to the amendment <e> <s> i am mainly impressed by the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> however speaking personally i am a little concerned that the rigidity of formulae may not be entirely practical with situations varying in different parts of the country <e> <s> i should be much happier if the minister would give us some assurance about housing benefit <e> <s> the problem has to be solved from two ends one is to keep rents down the other is to make them affordable from below by housing benefit <e> <s> i believe that the tenants guarantee has not yet been set out although i may be wrong <e> <s> if some assurance could be given about housing benefit and incorporating something about affordability in the tenants guarantee i should feel happier about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself lost in the verbiage of clause <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend the minister would make the underlying intention clear to me <e> <s> i had understood that the provision was to replace by a rent surplus fund the rather inequitable grant redemption fund by which profits derived from housing association grant were liable to be clawed back <e> <s> if behind the new rent surplus fund lies the intention which has been mentioned to housing trusts by the ministry of only clawing back per cent <e> <s> that is very welcome <e> <s> to lose the clause if that is what it means would be regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether he considers that the introduction of first-class and second-class mail with experience over the years has helped or hindered the speed of letter delivery <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the problem of homelessness would be reduced if councils were allowed to retain for new building more than per cent <e> <s> of the receipts from the right to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for his answer it is clearly no use to press him for figures since her majestys government seem to regard themselves perhaps constitutionally as unable to deal with the question of expenditure and the effect on fares <e> <s> therefore may i ask my noble friend in the general context of the merits of clocks whether there is any hope that the clock at andover will be repaired and retained <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with the far-ranging points made by the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> i intend to speak briefly on a narrower field <e> <s> surely one way of increasing the use of the railways is by keeping down fares <e> <s> therefore it is essential that british rail should not throw away money on unnecessary expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a conflict between insulating houses to keep people warm and opening the windows to keep people healthy <e> <s> can that not best be resolved by urging people to wear more clothes and not to live in their shirtsleeves in hothouses as they do across the atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest that in a competition for domestic supply there would be a conflict as to the ownership of the supply lines <e> <s> would there not be a danger of getting the wires crossed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend when replying for the government will indicate whether subsection means that all the members of a consumers committee have to be experts in electricity rather than in representing the interests of the consumer <e> <s> if so the amendment of the noble lord lord peston is necessary <e>", "<cs> i should like to support all that my noble friend lord montagu has said <e> <s> while head of an independent organisation he stands at the right hand of the government in protecting our heritage <e> <s> i think that he should be listened to very attentively by the government because in my view he is almost a member of the government <e> <s> i hope that he will be regarded as such <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that a greater danger than thistledown is ragwort which is known in scotland as stinking willy <e> <s> it causes death by convulsion in horses and otherwise in cattle <e> <s> sheep survive because they do not live long enough for the poison to build in them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> as he has said that clarification is necessary i take it that he will not be surprised that i have come across several postmen on the beat as well as at the counter of the post office in westminster who say that under new regulations it is now necessary to put air mail stickers on letters for europe and ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for his economically worded reply i have to declare an interest not only as a farmer but also as a trustee of a large charitable housing trust <e> <s> i have given my noble friend figures which show that the reimbursement of the community charge to resident superintendents and others together with the income tax and insurance on it even after allowing for the old rates saved at per cent <e> <s> reduction is likely to cost the trust a year <e> <s> does my noble friend appreciate that while a farmer can possibly set such disbursements against his taxable profits charities have no taxable profits against which to set them <e> <s> will the government look at ways of alleviating such inequitable side effects of the unpalatable perhaps wholesome but untried medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask my noble friend this <e> <s> if an employee whether policeman agricultural worker or charitable housing superintendent has his community charge and the income tax upon it refunded will there then be a further income tax on that income tax and further income tax on that income tax <e> <s> does he see any end to this inequitable spiral <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen an american programme entitled god power in which a weight-lifting champion in a bathing suit asks for money in order to give power to the deity <e> <s> does he not consider that such commercial exploitation of religion is a desecration of it <e>", "<cs> my lords in that context will my noble friend consider accelerating support for the housing corporation which at the moment is applying the brakes when it might help the building situation by applying the accelerator to schemes which are in hand <e> <s> is it not better in a time of relative slump to spend less money than to spend more money at a time of boom which we all hope is coming <e>", "<cs> my lords is the contribution of methane gas towards the greenhouse effect the same as or greater than co <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to sympathise with the opposition <e> <s> it appears to be a mild obligation to impose on broadcasters <e> <s> it is a small item of public service which they should have in mind and be obliged to have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be possible to vote on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was whether it would be possible to vote on amendment no <e> <s> which i support but not on amendment no <e> <s> which i am against <e>"]
