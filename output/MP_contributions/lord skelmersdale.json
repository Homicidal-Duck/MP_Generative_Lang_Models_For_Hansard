["<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make further provision for the protection and conservation of wild creatures and of plants growing wild <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords days ago i was giving preliminary thought as to what i should say on this occasion bearing in mind that it would have been the third time of asking your lordships to give a second reading to this particular bill <e> <s> however i am glad to be able to tell you that this afternoon the scenario is somewhat different for reasons which i will now explain <e> <s> owing to the rather late arrival this morning of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both the noble baroness lady stedman and my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that very small changes usually downwards in the temperature of the sea cause fish to desert their traditional feeding grounds and that by extension only very small changes upwards are needed to re-establish for example the sardine fishing industry off the coast of cornwall <e> <s> will he further agree that power stations nuclear or otherwise could well be sited with such considerations in view <e>", "<cs> my lords i was particularly pleased to see this order on todays order paper not that i want to rake up any stale coals or to accuse this or that member of your lordships house of any dreamt-up or real infamy that i might bring forward but because i feel it is perhaps a little overdue <e> <s> i know there are good reasons for it <e> <s> the st march st davids day is now four months ago and of course a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then <e> <s> not only have we had the results which came out very quickly of the referenda but we have had a change of government and i think it would be fair to say at this point that as we have had these very concrete results from the referenda and particularly the welsh one that we are now discussing whatever government were now in power would be moving this order <e>", "<cs> i think that i am right in saying that the noble lord said that this bill was an attack upon comprehensive education <e> <s> it is not as my noble friend lady young has said on many occasions <e> <s> it is an attack on the continuing forced putting-into-practice of comprehensive education <e> <s> that is why i am voting for the bill <e> <s> i am not voting for it because i believe as the noble lord has just said that it is an attack upon comprehensive education <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby made much use of the word conservation and i wonder what he means by it <e> <s> i am possibly fairly well-known in your lordships house as being a conservationist but again none of your lordships has thought fit to question me on what i mean by the term <e> <s> there is a great difference between the word conservation and the word preservation which the noble lord lord beaumont used and i suggest to your lordships that one is the end result of the other <e> <s> conservation to me means the use of renewable resources to the benefit of mankind whereas preservation benefit of mankind whereas preservation is where this use has become so damaging to the resource in question that blanket controls are necessary to prohibit any interference whether this is talking about animals plants oil or fish <e> <s> the word conservation is used for oil in exactly the same context as i have just described to your lordships <e> <s> the word conservation is used for fish in exactly the same context as i have just described <e> <s> there are momentary preservation orders put on stocks of fish in the north sea or elsewhere but only so that the fish can then build themselves up again to be used as a resource for mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords when i put my name down very late to speak in this debate i was perfectly aware that much of what i had to say to use the phrase of the noble lord lord winstanley would be nibbled away at during the course of the speeches by a large number of noble lords <e> <s> however i had hardly expected to be stripped naked as it were in the presence of two maiden ladies who we all congratulate for having given us the benefit of their wise advice on this particular occasion and we hope that we shall hear from them very often in the future <e>", "<cs> i must agree with the noble lord lord wynne-jones when he attacks my noble friend on the front bench for comparing bees with plants <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend is trying to pull the cotton grass over our eyes because the two things cannot possibly be comparable <e> <s> we seem to be getting from the general to the particular in the last few speeches on these amendments <e> <s> but were i in any position of responsibility i would not give compensation to anybody for the simple reason that i support my <e>", "<cs> since i have this opportunity perhaps i may ask a question about clause which has to do with enactments repealed <e> <s> i think it was on th march this year i have not checked my facts so they may be a little hazy as to the date we were all rather otherwise engaged that an order was laid before parliament which i think was passed <e> <s> it was the bees import order which was laid under section of the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act <e> <s> this order currently has the force of law as i understand it <e> <s> i also understand that under subsection of clause section of the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act ceases to have effect <e> <s> therefore i have two questions <e> <s> one is what is the validity then of the order <e> <s> secondly since so far as i can see the order <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i had kippers for breakfast <e> <s> on a rather more serious point will he agree that the object of conservation is to achieve a balance between land use the status and species of animals and plants and the legitimate needs of man and to maintain that balance <e> <s> in this context will he further agree that hares are currently in balance and therefore do not need the protection of conservation legislation <e> <s> furthermore can he also say when the governments planned discussion document on the countryside bill is due to be published <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that although it is a very simple little amendment i for one and i have studied it fairly carefully as i have studied most of the amendments to this bill so far fairly carefully simply do not understand it <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i really cannot follow that argument at all <e> <s> what is education all about <e> <s> is it about children or is it about schools <e> <s> surely the object of the exercise is to get the best education one possibly can for a particular child in a particular place at a particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that it would be administratively impossible to distinguish between the use to which fertilisers were going to be put at the point of sale <e> <s> therefore far from reducing the possible costs if the advice in the question were followed it would increase them and make a complete muddle of the whole operation of vat in the fertiliser industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise to the house and to my noble friend lord dulverton for not having included my name in the list of speakers for this debate <e> <s> i did not intend to be in the house this afternoon it was only by the merest accident that i managed to turn up at all <e> <s> i regret that i missed the opening speeches but i managed to come in at the beginning of the excellent maiden speech of the noble viscount lord devonport in which he mentioned particularly the integration of forestry with other interests in the countryside <e> <s> i understood him to be thinking particularly of conservation interests <e> <s> to my mind conservation means the balancing of mans interference with the animals plants and minerals of this planet to the ultimate benefit of all the earths inhabitants mankind animals plants the whole spectrum <e> <s> i do not see why in the context of forestry all these interests should not be reconciled <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of view of the society follows the conservation theme which i mentioned earlier <e> <s> the most important areas for nature conservation have been and are in the process of being identified by surveys carried out by the nature conservancy council and the voluntry nature conservation bodies <e> <s> once identified the prime areas will be notified by the ncc as sites of special scientific interest or possibly as something else <e> <s> indeed i understand that there is a government series of sssis super sites of scientific interest <e> <s> in order to maintain this scientific interest whether it be botanical ornithological or mineral it may well be necessary to think twice about afforestation or re-afforestation of whatever form of serried ranks of cypress spruce marching across the uplands or whatever it may be <e> <s> i have a daughter who is at primary school who is very much at the stage of bedtime stories and who loves the stories of hans christian andersen and others <e> <s> however that is not the reason why i do not particularly like these serried ranks <e> <s> i think that there are other reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had occasion to mention the details of my small horticultural business before in this chamber but since my third largest item of expenditure as a retail mail order organisation is on the post office and since the expenditure will be something over this calendar year i thought that perhaps this might be a suitable opportunity to come in on this most important debate initiated by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i misunderstood what the noble lord was saying and i apologise <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bellwin did not extend the point that he was making quite as far as he might have done <e> <s> is it not a fact that points relative to the commissioners decision and inquiries may quite easily not come from relevant people in regard to the particular application <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been complaining for years about the <e>", "<cs> my lords after this great length of time am i glad to see this bill <e> <s> yes i certainly am <e> <s> not only has it enabled us to hear two very well thought out constructive maiden speeches but it has enabled your lordships to do a tremendous amount of philosophising about the general tenets of the countryside and the relationships between the countryside conservation and agriculture <e> <s> last but not least it has lowered the average age of the speakers in at least one of our debates this week so that can be no bad thing can it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence on two counts that i rise to address your lordships on this occasion <e> <s> in the first place i am a very strong supporter indeed of this government <e> <s> i believe that if anybody can put the great back into great britain it is this government and i think that in many ways it is beginning to do just that <e> <s> i wish that the home office and my noble friend lord belstead who is speaking for the government at the end of this debate were striding ahead quite as fast as some other departments and ministers of this particular government <e> <s> the second reason why i rise with great diffidence is that it is always extremely difficult to get on the same wave-length of clarity of explanation as the noble lord lord ashby <e> <s> i am grateful to him in that without any collusion on our part he has in the most miraculous way led in to what i want to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way <e> <s> this is rapidly becoming a debate <e> <s> i think it would be to the convenience of the house if we moved on <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have some rather bad news to impart from this bench <e> <s> i think it is an open secret by now that the government have very little enthusiasm at all for this bill <e> <s> as my noble friend lord avon said on second reading on th january at column of the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has obviously taken great note of the remarks of my noble friend lord avon and others at second reading <e> <s> on that occasion my noble friend was extremely critical of the proposed enforcement duties to be imposed on the secretary of state <e> <s> their removal will certainly improve the bill to this extent <e> <s> the government therefore support the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers have stressed in speeches and articles that it is important for local authorities to consider how contracting-out can produce useful economies in the provision of services <e> <s> the department of the environment has commissioned a study of service and pricing decisions for a range of local authority services in england <e> <s> more specifically regulations implementing part iii of the local government planning and land act which will require a wide range of the work of local authority direct labour organisations to be the subject of competitive tender will shortly be laid before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the profit motive of course promotes efficiency and thus potential cost-savings for a given level of service <e> <s> other potential benefits would include savings on capital investment less administration and management and flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the most normal services which we envisage in this area are the environmental health services which of course include such services as public conveniences the control of air pollution cesspool-emptying and so on <e> <s> the other particular one we have in mind is refuse collection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that this is implicit in the question but i shall of course bring the noble lords point to the knowledge of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend lord gainford the object of the legislation on direct labour organisations is that they must be seen to give ratepayers and taxpayers value for money <e> <s> they must be accountable make efficient use of their assets and face real and direct competition from the private sector <e> <s> our legislation will achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell is very kind <e> <s> i shall remember his words when we get a little busier later on in the session <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the house that my brain has been considerably exercised over this matter in the last few days but basically i would agree with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities are always very aware of costings and it is partly as a result of some rather loose costings that have been carried out in the last few years that we have enacted this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords my departments recent circular on <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with that <e> <s> the only convincing reasons that come readily to mind are intrusion into open countryside noise smells safety health or excessive traffic operation <e> <s> very often these small rural industries are not affected by any of these reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords high interest rates are common to the whole economy and i do not think to direct them specifically to small industries does us any good in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware there was no collusion between my two noble friends <e> <s> if there was i am sure i would have been able to get to the bottom of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware that there are many farm buildings but unfortunately they are often in isolated sites and without services such as sewerage electricity and telephones which would need to be brought to them before they could be so used <e> <s> the other problem is that very often they are with inadequate access and the fire brigade particularly is concerned in the planning application for them <e> <s> however having said all that yes they can be used and frequently are used for such purposes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend lord long dealt at length with this subject about a fortnight ago and i did not think it was necessary to go into his answers now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have got no information on that subject <e> <s> i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest and care to the speeches of the two noble lords this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord underhill will not think it discourteous of me if first i comment on what the noble lord lord winstanley said while it is fresh in my mind <e> <s> i am very well aware of the point he made <e> <s> having up to a month ago made my entire living off the leisure industry i am very well aware of the opportunities that can and should be created and which in the particular case which the noble lord mentioned are being created <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to my noble friend lord inglewood for introducing this bill this afternoon <e> <s> we have of course a great deal of business in front of us today but i think that it might assist the house if i were to intervene very briefly at this stage to give the governments view on the provisions in the bill concerning the control of metal detectors <e>", "<cs> my lords since it is now three minutes to seven i think that this would be an appropriate moment for your lordships to break for one hour exactly <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have announced in another place measures on gas and electricity prices which will cost some million in the coming financial year <e> <s> these measures which are additional to steps already taken will provide considerable benefit particularly to large energy-intensive users <e> <s> the nedc task force report was taken fully into account in reaching these decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords what my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer does in his budget is a matter for him and not i think for either me or this house <e> <s> however on the earlier part of the noble lords supplementary the nedc task force report discovered that for a small but important group of energy-intensive consumers forming part of the remaining per cent <e> <s> that is the per cent <e> <s> over and above the per cent <e> <s> of individual industrial customers who remain broadly in line with those on the continent the united kingdom prices had moved significantly ahead of those being charged to some major competitors on the continent by the end of <e> <s> therefore to that extent i would agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the national coal board to decide their policy on specific projects <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for that correction <e>", "<cs> my lords the government and the coal board are considering that among all their other projects <e>", "<cs> so far as i know my lords no decision on that has actually been taken <e> <s> i will bring the noble lords points to the attention of sir derek but i think that is as far as i can go now <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i said that so far as i was aware no decision had yet been taken <e> <s> i stand by that <e> <s> i would add that to my certain knowledge discussions are still going on <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord burton for moving this amendment and also for the support which it will be seen to have received if that is the correct english from the front bench opposite <e> <s> we have really had two points of view about the effectiveness of the operations of the british waterways board <e> <s> i think we can agree that our inland waterways are a national asset which deserve to be preserved and enjoyed for their recreational value and also and here i particularly agree with the noble lord lord underhill for their transport function <e> <s> this is the governments firm intention and we propose to continue to assist the board to maintain the waterways in a useful condition consistent with their status to the extent that national economic circumstances allow <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that was what i thought i said but obviously i did not make myself clear <e>", "<cs> i too with the permission of the committee should like to take these three amendments together <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has made very clear his view that the cost of exempting charges for water for fire-fighting should not fall on certain categories of consumer and his amendments are designed to achieve this <e> <s> none the less the government must ask your lordships to reject them <e> <s> if accepted they would impose unnecessary and troublesome constraints on water undertakers in the way in which they structure their charges <e> <s> imagine the additional administrative work involved in identifying these categories in each water authority area <e> <s> the cost of this could well outweigh the relatively small revenue lost by these exemptions and of course it would be quite open to the water authority to pass on these administrative costs to all consumers and i stress all <e>", "<cs> on that point clause says that the statutory water undertaker <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to know where to start in replying to the points made <e> <s> with the permission of the noble lord lord underhill i should like to refer first to my noble friend whose experience and expertise in these matters we welcome to our deliberations <e> <s> of course i know about the letter of his successor sir robert marshall to my honourable friend mr shaw <e> <s> in fact i have a copy of it before me <e> <s> perhaps i can tie in this point with something that the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> the letter is dated th march and it is now the th march <e> <s> we have already decided to widen the consultations that are to take place and i do not consider that we are being exactly laggard in how we are dealing with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i must chalk up another failure on my score card <e> <s> my hope was that i had already explained this to the noble lord in my letter but obviously i did not go far enough and with the permission of the committee i will make another attempt <e> <s> this amendment seeks to cover ground which i believe was extensively covered in another place <e> <s> the amendments discussed there related to the charges payable for bulk supplies of water by one authority to another <e> <s> as i understand it the aim of this amendment is much the same that is to draw attention to the level of water charges in wales and to seek some means of offsetting the loss of payment to the welsh water authority following abandonment of the water charges equalisation scheme <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for speaking to both these amendments together <e> <s> it is often suggested that water authorities should introduce a rebate scheme but this suggestion shows a misconception of the nature of water charges <e> <s> the general rate is a tax on the beneficial occupation of property i am sure we would all agree with that <e> <s> charges for water services on the other hand are raised in respect of services provided in much the same way as other public utilities raise charges <e> <s> within the taxation system it has been the practice to provide rebates to reduce either wholly or partially the liability of those on low incomes <e> <s> outside that system however the suggestion of rebates raises difficult questions <e> <s> who should be paying for whose water and why <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill does so perhaps i should point out that the noble lord lord winstanley is talking about the old water rate <e> <s> at the moment we are talking about something rather different that is to say the water charges for services rendered <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pretend that the speech of the noble baroness lady white was quite a bolt from the blue but it was tinged with purple because i had a tiny bit of warning on it <e> <s> but even so i am afraid that i am unable at this precise moment to give her the satisfaction which she obviously wants and indeed deserves because i fully appreciate in spite of what appears now to be perhaps a little bit of complacency in my second reading speech that these are very serious points indeed and i would not differ from her on that <e>", "<cs> my lords over recent years most manufacturers of imported cars have taken steps to provide mounting spaces large enough for a british number plate <e> <s> while this has significantly reduced our difficulties with sub-standard plates there are still some vehicles mostly american cars which cannot accommodate a full-size number plate <e> <s> the practice of fitting the so-called mini number plates is a potential road safety problem which we are considering along with other problems relating to number plates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right the enforcement of the regulation is in the hands of the police <e> <s> but the use of police resources is of course a matter for individual chief officers <e> <s> however in any case individual prosecutions do not get to the root of the problem <e> <s> the real need is to ensure that a legal plate can be fitted and is fitted to a vehicle when it is new <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already recognised that there is a problem here <e> <s> i would not say that the law is openly flouted but there are some occasions for particular reasons when the law is not <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is <e> <s> the present standards are laid down by regulation which of course was approved by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the problem is that these mini number plates contain letters which are some per cent <e> <s> smaller than the normal ones that we are accustomed to on cars <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course approached the representatives of the manufacturers about the difficulties <e> <s> our reason for going to them first is that the provision of an adequate mounting space on a car is in our view the best way of tackling the problem <e> <s> this approach has already worked well with several manufacturers of imported cars <e> <s> the residual problem is not large but if any of the import concessionaires or dealers in vehicles which have this difficulty are concerned about the problem and wish to discuss it the officials of my department would be happy to arrange a meeting <e> <s> further to this the residual problem appears to be that privately imported cars for example for servicemen who are serving here and belong to other nationalities are subsequently sold into the trade in this country <e> <s> at the time when they owned them they were legal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a question of semantics which i am not qualified to answer on this occasion but i shall consider and write to the noble lord if i may <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but this would add to the pressing problems of bureaucracy which we have at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are grateful to the noble viscount for drawing attention to access week in this interesting way <e> <s> while i appreciate the intention underlying the question i doubt whether the suggestion contained in it would prove practicable even if it were possible for all those mentioned to carry it into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that local groups of disabled people would be greatly encouraged by the interest and support of members of both houses but this is a matter which the individuals concerned will wish to decide for themselves <e> <s> i would also think it would be extremely helpful to the cause for local authority officers and perhaps local councillors to be involved in this particular exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the property services agency is compiling comprehensive lists as part of a scheme monitoring the civil estate <e> <s> these will take time to complete <e> <s> as they are ready they are supplied to the civil service commission to assist them in the assignment of disabled candidates in the competitions they run <e> <s> we are not just talking about wheelchairs <e> <s> there are wider problems with people who are still disabled although not in wheelchairs <e> <s> they have different access problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> i hope the house will agree my taking amendments nos <e> <s> to

question of charges for the use of water for power generation <e> <s> that is it in the bill at all is of course a tribute to the praiseworthy eloquence of my noble friend lord strathcona supported i understand i do not think i was here on that occasion by the noble lord lord strabolgi and others who first raised this important subject during the committee stage of the bill in this house <e>",

treaties accession of the republic of zimbabwe to the second acp-eec convention of lom order which was laid before this house on th april be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for his very sympathetic reception of this order <e> <s> he asked a number of detailed questions and made comments on some of the things i said <e> <s> one thing i should like to tell him at this moment and if there is anything else which jointly we feel i ought to be communicating with him about i shall of course write is on the subject of maize and other surpluses <e> <s> the community is currently considering in what way it can help zimbabwes maize surplus to be made use of in neighbouring countries but there are major difficulties over transporting the maize <e> <s> i further understand that in recent weeks zimbabwe farmers have been able to dispose of a considerable amount of the surplus through commercial contracts <e> <s> so a small step in this direction is being taken <e> <s> i like the noble lord should like to see this step made considerably greater and i am sure that it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not use the word commonwealth in relation to maize <e> <s> but i am sure that these are some of the things that will be looked at both here and in the community in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no information about military operations by indonesia in east timor since the middle of april <e> <s> all relevant factors are taken into account in reaching decisions on defence sales but it is not practical to seek assurances about the use to which military equipment may be put <e>", "<cs> my lords such reports as we have i agree that they are difficult to come by suggest that conditions in east timor are now relatively peaceful although incidents do occur from time to time <e> <s> the last one that we know about was in the middle of april last <e> <s> so far as the hawk aircraft are concerned and their suitability as ground attack weapons the training aircraft are in fact considerably under-stressed <e> <s> in order to add military hardware on to them i understand that they would have to be substantially different aircraft and therefore there is absolutely no likelihood of their being used for this purpose in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend and i am sure that the noble lord lord avebury would like to talk to my noble friend on this particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed they have taken up an option on another four <e> <s> and why should

facilities in walvis bay and so he served his sentence in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister fully expressed the governments views when she stated on th july in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the south african government is of course the administering authority in walvis bay and this gentleman mr webster who was a local politician there was not a british citizen <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and the other members of the committee who have spoken <e> <s> we know that there has been wide concern among port users on this particular subject <e> <s> port charging is an important subject and the government have therefore given careful consideration to the many requests to extend the present right of objection against ship passenger and goods dues to cover all port charges <e> <s> it is important to recognise first the important distinction between ship passenger and goods dues on the one hand and other port charges on the other hand <e> <s> the dues are levied on all port users in respect of the use of the basic or essential port and harbour and reflect the authoritys costs in the provision of the harbour infrastructure and the maintenance of approach channels lights buoys and beacons <e> <s> they are essentually in the nature of a tax an amount payable by a user but not necessarily directly

is no <e> <s> were we satisfied that there was a monopoly i am sure we would look very carefully with regard to considering the suggestion of the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> but since we are not i am afraid there is no hope of that <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord simon referred to the appointments system and i shall try to clarify both his mind and my own mind because i too find this

want to learn properly and pass his test is that without it he then moves to what i have referred to as the off period which means that if he wants to drive on a public road he will lose his opportunity for a year before he can start again <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to co-relate as it were the words on the marshalled list with my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the words on the marshalled list would appear to mean that a positive resolution of each house of parliament would be required but what i understood my noble friend to say in this connection was rather different and perhaps would have been better had it been raised under the question whether the clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> however i shall have a go <e>", "<cs> splendid <e> <s> the object is to take the motorcycle test at heavy goods vehicle testing stations as proposed in the recent consultation paper on the two-part test <e> <s> the road haulage industry will of course not and i repeat not have a worse service of vehicle and driving tests especially in terms of waiting periods and i can assure the committee that the department would arrange the conduct of the various tests so that this did not happen <e> <s> we are still not in a position to bring forward the regulations prescribed in the two-part motorcycle test <e> <s> when we are they will all be brought before parliament but as i sort of half said in my rather wishy-washy introduction to this reply the idea of having such things by affirmative resolution is so unusual that i am afraid that i would have to rule it out of hand <e>", "<cs> yes of course we can <e> <s> the point is that the amendment would conflict with section of the act which is not consequentially <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive me for one moment i should like to respond to the noble lord lord mishcon and say that most certainly i shall willingly write both to my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> again i rather think that i shall have to take the advice of the noble lord lord mishcon on this subject <e> <s> this has been quite a bombshell which i was not expecting and with your lordships permission i should like to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i shall try very hard not to exceed the speed limit <e> <s> i appreciate that many people are very worried about this matter which is an entirely new concept as the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> again it is rather complicated <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill responds perhaps i should say in answer to my noble friends that the home secretary is required under section <e>", "<cs> i could not give that information off the cuff but i will write to my noble friend <e> <s> variations as to the geographical layout population and number of traffic patrols in different forces mean that they will have different needs and no set formula will be used in distributing machines among them <e> <s> we expect however that machines will be installed at those stations where most drink-driving offenders are currently taken <e> <s> although in theory a police surgeon could be called to any station at night in practice the system is already largely centred on specific stations and the breath machines will be placed to follow this pattern <e> <s> we do not need and could not afford to put a machine in every station but this does not mean that people will be unreasonably denied use of the machine <e> <s> having said all that i can assure the committee that there will be no question of bringing these provisions into operation until we are sure there is a reasonable coverage across the country <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that this matter was first raised during the commons committee stage <e> <s> the government undertook to do something about it and indeed did but in another part of the bill <e> <s> the powers relating to orders made by the secretary of state are contained in section of the road traffic act to which i have already referred <e> <s> an amendment to this section to give effect to the proposals now suggested in these amendments was considered and accepted in another place <e> <s> noble lords will find this in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> in these circumstances i hope the noble lord will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords any decision on the cases of the seven former mercenaries is of course a matter for the angolan government but we have taken steps to ensure that the angolan government is fully aware of our concern for these men to whom our embassy now has regular consular access <e> <s> we shall continue to pay close attention to their cases <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something which in the first instance is a matter for the men themselves and their relatives <e> <s> we have intense consular activity in that area <e> <s> secondly it is a particularly touchy part of the world as the noble lord and the house will appreciate and it is unlikely that the angolans will see things in quite the light that the noble lord would hope until there is an improvement in that part of southern africa <e>", "<cs> my lords representations have in the past been made and when there is the slightest hope of the further possibility of successful representations this will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords all members of the government my right honourable friend the prime minister my right honourable and noble friend the foreign secretary have always condemned mercenaries <e> <s> we do this without hesitation and will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have no background information on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords currently all the men are reported to be in reasonable health <e> <s> they are allowed regular exercise and receive medical treatment when necessary <e> <s> recently i understand one of them has undergone surgery but there has been no problem about this and all are in excellent health <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now moving into a difficult area <e> <s> we should all like to stop it but it is not quite so easy as one would think <e> <s> we are continually having discussions between ourselves member states and all other governments and will obviously do our best to bring these to a conclusion but i cannot hold out any hope at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am unsure on that point i will certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords whether they are going to be recruited surely depends on whether they are going to be released <e>", "<cs> we recognise that the present limit of liability of is too low <e> <s> todays equivalent of as it was in is approximately <e> <s> the figure suggested in the first of my noble friends amendments is not so far out <e> <s> i should perhaps make it clear that but for the railway fires acts it would be difficult for railway companies to be held liable for damage to crops by fires caused by sparks from railway engines <e> <s> the reason for this is that they could plead their statutory authority to operate a railway <e> <s> in other words in this particular case privileges are removed from this particiular statutory undertaker <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly prepared to accept that the weight of my argument goes up and down depending on the time of night i am speaking and what i am speaking about <e> <s> having said that perhaps i may turn back to the amendment <e> <s> in logic and equity there is some force in the arguments that we have heard today some force but i am afraid still not enough to convince me <e> <s> i shall go into the reasons for this in a minute <e> <s> if i may first stick strictly to the amendment the bill has already the flexibility to deal with a down-plating provision should we require it <e>", "<cs> i never like amendments and most certainly i shall do as my noble friend suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have studied the proposals of the world disarmament campaign submitted to the committee on disarmament in geneva <e> <s> in response we drew attention to the proposals already submitted to the united nations secretary-general giving united kingdom views on the question of a comprehensive programme of disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing that i was not aware of in that long list of supplementaries was the fact that the proposals had the support of the majority of the geneva committee <e> <s> however the government consider it unrealistic to seek to achieve the ultimate goals of general and complete disarmament of all nations through one treaty <e> <s> moreover it would be impracticable to set time scales for such a treaty in advance like the six-year limit envisaged in the wdc proposal <e> <s> the proposed treaty would be unnegotiable we feel in several respects <e> <s> for example it mentions that united nations inspectors in each state would have unimpeded access to all establishments and records <e> <s> i cannot see any prospect of the soviet leadership negotiating such a provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if your lordships feel that i have given an airy answer <e> <s> however positive steps are being made and our ambassador to the committee on disarmament has written in the may edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords like all members of the united nations we have accepted general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control as the ultimate goal of arms control efforts <e> <s> as the final document of the special session recognised progress towards world disarmament will depend on the successful negotiation of a number of specific arms control measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information on that particular point <e> <s> however we know that they refused even to allow international atomic agency safeguards on their civil nuclear programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have young children <e> <s> at a time when the soviet union continues to build up its nuclear and conventional forces unilateral disarmament which i think probably is the point the noble lord is getting at would serve only to undermine our security and weaken natos ability to deter aggression <e> <s> it would also remove the incentive for the soviet union to negotiate and indeed it would add to our own difficulties <e> <s> one cannot negotiate from a position of weakness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brockway says this feeling is worldwide <e> <s> so far as we know i would have to correct him and to say that it is westernwide <e> <s> the authoritarian states do not have or do not allow pressure groups such as the noble lord belongs to and therefore i think we have a very one-sided view of all this <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been a personal pleasure for me for three reasons <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and the noble lord lord john-mackie on their excellent maiden speeches <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear from them again both soon and often <e> <s> secondly i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord ohagan for having succeeded in finding time in a crowded parliamentary timetable to debate this important subject this afternoon <e> <s> it is a lucky and happy coincidence that i should be in the hot seat this evening to respond to this debate as i have known him on and off for over years indeed half our lives <e> <s> lastly in spite of what i am about to say sounding slightly odd it applies now just as well as when i wrote it some three days ago i have been struck by the unanimity of approach of all the speeches made today to which i have listened most carefully <e> <s> i am grateful for the wishes for a successful outcome to our forthcoming presidency and i know my noble friend will be too <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the principal intention of this bill is to enable the disposal of shares in amersham international limited known until its recent change of name as the radiochemical centre limited <e> <s> this is a company which has a worldwide reputation as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for industry medicine and research <e> <s> the bill also clarifies the present powers of the government to dispose of shares held in companies operating in the field of atomic energy in general and clarifies the present powers of the atomic energy authority to dispose of shares in any company <e> <s> i shall explain later why the bill has done this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear that the noble lord lord strabolgi regards me as one who provides trophies to hang on the wall in some conservative valhalla <e> <s> can i push the argument to him <e> <s> why on earth does he think we have a public sector in this country <e> <s> i believe that there are only three reasons one of which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will not appreciate <e> <s> these are for companies which are concerned with defence or where it is in the national interest that they should be so or where the government in some exceptional circumstances should provide a safety net <e> <s> rolls-royce is an obvious example of this for which we are frequently criticised <e> <s> once any of these is no longer required it is the governments philosophy and i cannot state it more clearly that there is no earthly reason for keeping any firm in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord then went into what are basically committee points on various words in the bill <e> <s> to save time may i recommend him to look at the two earlier acts to which i referred the act which set up the atomic energy authority and act because when we get to the committee stage on this bill we shall be referring a lot to those acts and making the position of those acts clearer <e> <s> we have used the same words as in those acts <e>", "<cs> my lords we are naturally aware of the worsening conditions of mr shcharanskys imprisonment and remain deeply concerned about his health <e> <s> this case has been raised with the soviet government both bilaterally and at the madrid csce meeting <e> <s> the government hope that the soviet authorities will recognise the strength of the humanitarian grounds for releasing him <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friends sentiments <e> <s> our view of the soviet record on human rights is well known we of course take the opportunity on suitable occasions to put it across to the russians directly and will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is to visit russia on monday next for talks with mr gromyko and a wide range of issues will certainly be discussed <e> <s> but there is no agenda for this meeting and i cannot of course guarantee or pre-empt what my noble friend might want to say <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter has been raised at the madrid conference and its subsequent meetings no less than three times <e> <s> the european community the united states canada and ourselves are co-sponsors of a proposal at madrid for improved observance by participating states according to the helsinki final act and its human rights provisions which includes a specific reference to the work of helsinki monitors like mr shcharansky <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i shall be seeing my noble friend tomorrow and i will certainly give that undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble viscount lord simon for raising this matter again and i am very sorry that the provisions of paragraph of schedule are still a cause for concern to the british ports association <e> <s> we have given assurances both in correspondence and during the commons committee stage as to the limited extent of the power and how we propose to exercise it <e> <s> i hope that i can satisfy the noble viscount the british ports association and your lordships on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first looked at this amendment i thought that it was probably rather a fast serve coming low over the net to my backhand but on reconsideration i accept that i was wrong and that it was perfectly properly put down as the noble lord lord underhill explained <e> <s> as i am sure your lordships will recall we had a debate on this subject during the committee stage <e> <s> i had hoped on that occasion that i had persuaded the opposition that there was no case for extending the existing right of appeal against ship passenger and goods dues to cover cargo handling charges also <e> <s> for the second time this evening i will have another go <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that you should switch the vessels point of arrival when it was on the high seas but i was suggesting that since in advance you would know what the dues were going to be in any particular port you would therefore be able to choose your port to take advantage of the dues and charges in a particular port <e>", "<cs> my lords the council will concentrate first on identifying the needs in each country and then encourage funding for projects from all possible sources <e> <s> in the united nations system we expect to contribute to such projects chiefly through what we put into the united nations development programme <e> <s> this provides each country with money to meet its national priorities for technical co-operation from the whole system <e> <s> we shall also be ready to consider within the limits of our resources requests from individual countries for aid for sound projects identified by the council <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course unesco is concerned with the free flow of information <e> <s> regarding the last supplementary question of the noble lord lord brockway the information i have is that the netherlands india mexico and iraq have already pledged to make money available to the fund and several other countries including france and norway have said they hope to contribute <e> <s> other potential donors have argued strongly that the ipgc should not be a financing body <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously unable to give any commitment to any particular project as the noble lord lord hatch will understand but i most certainly agree with him that communications and the free flow of information are absolutely vital <e>", "<cs> my lords public relations is always a problem but we will certainly see that we do our best <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble baroness is of course quite right and we shall do everything we can to further this aim at the mexico conference <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> snap phrases seem to be all the rage and i agree with the noble lord lord gladwyn on this <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the original question <e> <s> but noble lords will have an opportunity to question the government on this matter on tuesday because there is a question down by the noble lord lord strabolgi <e>", "<cs> my lords the main assumptions are that there could be a significant surplus of united kingdom oil production over united kingdom consumption in the s that we shall become net oil importers again in the early s and that the real price of crude oil will continue to rise over the longer term <e> <s> but there are many uncertainties in all this <e> <s> that is why the depletion policy which the secretary of state for energy announced last july is a flexible one with decisions being taken on a case-by-case basis as they arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly take that point back to the department but i should say that we are in a totally market situation in this particular case <e> <s> however the governments oil demand estimate as i am sure my noble friend will know is that future oil demand will of course depend on many factors including the rate of economic growth developments in oil prices and the prices of competing fuels <e> <s> of course the uncertainties associated with these factors are considerable <e> <s> for this reason it would be unwise to adopt any single view about future oil demand over a certain time period relevant to depletion policy considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many things which will make depletion policy and conservation difficult but i do not think that is one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords again my right honourable friend and the department will of course consider that point <e>", "<cs> i think this is probably an appropriate moment to resume the house in order to take other business during the dinner hour which will last until eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the total staff of the british information services in the united states has been reduced in the last years from to a reduction of united kingdom-based and locally-engaged officers <e> <s> the present establishment is made up of two united kingdom-based officers in washington and three in new york supported by a total of locally-engaged officers deployed as follows washington new york atlanta boston chicago houston los angeles san francisco <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think that this service is doing a bad job <e> <s> i do not think that the numbers have been reduced unrealistically <e> <s> staff costs at the diplomatic services largest posts have been reduced by per cent <e> <s> in the last two years and of course information work cannot be excluded from this exercise <e> <s> in addition all posts in the united states are being inspected at the present time in accordance with the normal three-yearly inspection cycle <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the large preponderance in new york is of course that the centralised information gathering services of the united states are situated in that city <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at the beginning of this question that i was convinced that the information service in the united states was doing a very good job and i would certainly agree with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the entire information service is of course fully and continuously briefed from london through the medium of both washington and new york and any support that the outlying areas require is of course continuously and consistently given <e>", "<cs> my lords the information services the government here and members of parliament on exchange visits and so on are doing everything they possibly can to make absolutely clear to responsible opinion in the press and in the united states exactly what is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to write to the noble lord on that because i do not have the detailed breakdown with me <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier i mentioned that we were in the middle of a triennial review and obviously this is one of the matters at which we shall look <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may first respond to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth i would say that i am reminded of a saying on the west coast of scotland where i spent most of my summer holidays as a child <e> <s> the saying is we think better later <e> <s> that applies to my letter <e> <s> i hope that when my noble friend has read what i have said and what i am about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has stated the ground rules for this committee stage very clearly and i am glad to follow his lead <e> <s> at second reading i said specifically <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the amendment would not make matters much clearer <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment would be to limit the secretary of states disposal powers to companies named in the schedule <e> <s> i notice that only two of the three named <e>", "<cs> these are the only companies which the secretary of state currently owns <e> <s> there is no secrecy about that it is a fact <e> <s> if i might clarify a point made by the noble lord lord strabolgi amersham international limited became amersham international limited on th may this year which is why it was necessary to change its name because the earlier name was in the earlier legislation <e> <s> that is why we have this rather confusing statement in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> for the reason which i thought i had explained <e> <s> it is that i cannot tell your lordships at this moment what companies the secretary of state might acquire in the future <e> <s> we know that legislation now has a very long life and with the pressures on parliamentary business does it not seem sensible at this precise moment without knowing whether there will be any more companies concerned in the future to clarify the position in respect of them as well as for the companies we are already talking about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran being a lawyer will understand that i am absolutely terrified of lawyers and he will also under <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> yes i am dealing with amendment no <e> <s> but unfortunately i misread my notes on this particular subject <e> <s> what i should have said is that any company involved in <e>", "<cs> we must get this right if we are to stick to the ground rules as it were <e> <s> i said that the bill does not in any way apply to weapons construction <e> <s> as i said on second reading and have repeated amersham internationals products are not relevant to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i took such a hard line as the noble lord described it on the last amendment <e> <s> i did not mean to be quite so fierce as i seem to have got into the habit of being and i shall try to correct my ways <e> <s> the purpose and the effect of the amendment is to limit the atomic energy authoritys powers under the bill by preventing it from selling shares in a company which would result in a proliferation of nuclear weapons <e> <s> i said that we would get back to the atomic energy authority weapons group act and indeed that is exactly <e>", "<cs> no i would not describe it as quite a surmounting argument but i think it is sailing a little bit close to it <e> <s> forgetting about national interests just for one minute would the noble lords perhaps accept that the word promote is an active forceful word and not be contrary to is a rather neutral not to say negative wording <e> <s> so by substituting for does the sale promote the national interest the test is it contrary to the public interest it in fact weakens that particular clause or that sentence in the bill <e> <s> i really am surprised by this amendment for that reason <e>", "<cs> again this is a rather curious amendment <e> <s> its effect would be to restrict disposals made by the authority not the secretary of state but the authority under the direction of the secretary of state to these proposals which would promote non-proliferation of nuclear power <e> <s> as worded it would restrict disposals to be made under the bill by the authority acting under the direction of the secretary of state to those proposals that actually help to prevent the wider use of nuclear power <e> <s> the amendment would therefore effectively prevent any disposal made under a direction <e> <s> however perhaps the noble lord is in fact referring to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons <e> <s> is this so <e>", "<cs> well having gone through many of the other amendments moved by the noble lord one can see why i had to ask the question as i was really not quite sure <e> <s> but if he would continue this thought towards nuclear weapons what therefore he would be referring to would be the united kingdoms participation in the non-proliferation treaty or to the united kingdom international atomic energy agency or to the euratom safeguards agreement <e>", "<cs> this would appear to be an attempt to force the secretary of state to declare whether and if so why a disposal would have been illegal without this bill and to say why he thinks it is in the national interest to use his extension of powers <e> <s> this is i do not quite know how to describe it a startling idea <e> <s> i agree i have not got the experience of noble lords on the other side of the committee but i have never seen a precedent for this <e> <s> the whole point of the clarification of earlier legislation is to remove doubt as to the powers of the authority and the secretary of state to dispose of shares held by them <e> <s> this amendment clearly does not aid this clarification and is effectively unenforceable <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but having read his remarks again last night that i thought was the effect of what he said <e> <s> i do not want to cross swords with the noble lord because i know he did not mean it in a personal way but what he seemed to say was that i had little enthusiasm for the bill <e> <s> but i will read his speech again and i certainly apologise to the noble lord for misreading it the first time <e>", "<cs> be that as it may after that little interchange i am afraid i really cannot see any way to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i know that it is bad form to quote from ones own speeches in this house so i shall not do so <e> <s> i shall quote from what i rapidly wrote down of what the noble lord lord strabolgi said that there is no reason why the company should not remain in the public sector except for tory dogma <e> <s> i can see no reason why except for socialist dogma it should remain in the public sector <e> <s> what is there that says that because something has once got into the public sector it should stay there for all time <e> <s> i cannot see the logic behind that perhaps in the same way as lord strabolgi cannot see the logic behind my argument <e> <s> may we turn to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it quite clear that the government are perfectly willing to discuss the sale with the staff <e> <s> my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state has made one visit to amersham for this reason and has met the staff on another occasion <e> <s> i do not think that a statutory provision of this type is necessary or desirable <e> <s> to my knowledge there has been no precedent in other disposals <e> <s> i feel that it would be an unproductive use of public money and parliamentary time to lay such a report before each house <e> <s> i should like to emphasise the assurance that was given in another place and i repeat what i have already said this evening that the government would not agree to plans which jeopardised the future of the company or its staff <e> <s> i recognise that there is bound to be some uncertainty among employees but i can assure them that the government have their interests very much at heart <e> <s> we shall certainly take their views into consideration <e> <s> with that i hope that the noble lord lord strabolgi will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord oram for telling us about some of his great experience on this matter <e> <s> however while i believe very strongly in employee shareholdings i do not believe this amendment is the right way because if the shares are to be sold in a public share flotation employees whether directly or through an industrial and provident society or by any other means will be able to subscribe for shares just like any other person <e> <s> if they were to do so such applications would no doubt be looked at sympathetically <e> <s> however the government have not yet decided on the method of disposal <e> <s> there is plenty of time for that the sale cannot take place before next year <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that at this moment i am unable to explain in clear and concise terms <e> <s> perhaps i might be allowed to write to the noble lord on this point <e>", "<cs> i think that i can give half the answer <e> <s> the phrase radiochemical company is used by the draftsman in this bill because that is how the trcl was described in the act and there has to be continuity between the various acts of parliament <e> <s> so it is this bill which up-dates the position <e>", "<cs> the atomic energy authority do not have any of the liabilities or obligations described in the amendment and it is not intended that they shall <e> <s> there is only one licence agreement with amersham international and this does not involve information of use as regards nuclear weapons <e> <s> the two main licence agreements with bnfl each already expressly exclude information or inventions arising out of work carried out for the purposes of national defence <e> <s> the only purpose of these licence agreements with both companies was to allow them to continue what is now their present business which was previously carried on by the atomic energy authority before the atomic energy authority act transferred it to the companies <e> <s> there are no licence agreements with nnc involving work of use to nuclear weapons <e> <s> the amendment is therefore unnecessary and i hope the noble lord can agree with me that on this occasion his fears are groundless <e>", "<cs> no it would not be allowed to arise <e> <s> i do not think i can do better than quote part of a letter which the department of energy received from amersham international on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly do that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for education and science announced on nd june that he was minded to allow a place on the burnham further education committee to the association of polytechnic teachers <e> <s> the organisations currently represented on the committee have been invited to express any comments they may wish to make on the proposal <e> <s> those views will be taken into account before a final decision is made on the associations application <e>", "<cs> my lords a change on the burnham committee is bound to be discussed from time to time <e> <s> i cannot agree that it is necessarily foolish <e> <s> the house will recall that in my original answer i said that my right honourable and learned friend was minded to have a change but i did not say that this was going to happen <e> <s> associations currently represented on the committee were invited to express their views on the proposal by today <e> <s> of course i cannot pre-empt what may be in those replies or indeed what my right honourable and learned friend may decide as a result of those replies <e>", "<cs> my lords representations have been made <e> <s> i am afraid i am not privy to the details of these but if i may i shall certainly write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that again i have not got that information <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly i will write to both the noble baroness and the noble lord on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords reductions in public expenditure are an essential component of the governments counter-inflationary policy <e> <s> as some programmes are being maintained or increased others have had to be cut by more than the average reduction <e> <s> but the planned reductions in several domestic programmes are more severe than that for overseas aid the level of which remains substantial million gross in the current financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i do recall the previous exchanges with my noble friend lord trefgarne on this subject <e> <s> but as the public expenditure paper cmnd <e> <s> made quite clear total government expenditure is planned to decline by just over per cent <e> <s> between and while overseas aid is to fall by per cent <e> <s> in that period <e> <s> agriculture housing industry trade energy and employment are all due to fall by more than that amount <e> <s> in other words you can do anything with figures if you try <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that aid is better directed to specific projects <e> <s> as to the amount of aid of course this must be to a certain extent a guess because of the uncertainties in predicting both aid expenditure itself and the gross national product of this country which our aid would depend on <e>", "<cs> my lords before we even consider granting aid in a particular case of course many factors are taken into account and i would agree with the noble lord lord oram on his point <e>", "<cs> my lords many factors as i have already said make up for the amount of aid which is available but there is also another problem on whether this aid figure is in fact taken up <e> <s> for example in no promissory note was deposited in respect of the sixth replenishment of the international development association because the then united states congress had not ratified the agreement <e> <s> furthermore sluggish drawings bilaterally by some recipients in relation to the resources available are another important factor <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have noted this section of the brandt report and i think that without doubt there is something in it <e> <s> this is one of the many things which are currently being discussed and considered in the various aid ministries all over the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend but i did say considered and i did not go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to make provision for the attainment of independence by belize within the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that your lordships on this occasion if on no other are giving very serious consideration to and exercising your proper function of review of laws which the government are passing through parliament <e> <s> i know full well there are a myriad of questions and certainly a myriad have come to light during the debate today <e> <s> i shall do my best to answer most of the points raised but if i fail to do so i promise to write to any speaker whose points have not been answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to check this but my understanding is that it would only be at the invitation of the belizean government <e> <s> if i may i will write to the noble lord about that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before i am not in a position to give assurances while the current negotiations in new york are going on but that is one of the things that is being looked at <e> <s> the potential for further satisfactory growth exists in the belizean economy and with under-population in rural areas there is considerable scope for agricultural expansion of land not yet cultivated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not able to give an answer to that at this moment <e> <s> but i should imagine that under the nationality bill which is extremely complicated there will be many explanations given of peoples rights and so on and that there will be advertisements in the papers <e> <s> but again for a definitive answer i shall have to write to the noble lord lord pitt <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i do not know how many people this involves <e> <s> it might be vast numbers in which case it would be impracticable to send a letter to each individual <e>", "<cs> in that case i can certainly make sure that this is done <e>", "<cs> in that case i think i might take it upon myself to suggest that it probably is not appropriate for your lordships to move this amendment now <e> <s> i suggest that we come back to this committee stage at a quarter to eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very powerful speech from the noble lord lord pitt which has ended our debate <e> <s> i must say i agree with him most certainly we welcome the organisation of eastern caribbean states <e> <s> i would not go quite so far as the noble lord as to see in the future a single country a single state <e> <s> but i see it as a trading and political <e>", "<cs> give me a chance my lords <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was pre-empting me by about words which i am about to say <e> <s> first are the british government casting antigua adrift <e> <s> this is not so <e> <s> as i said associated statehood was conceived as a stepping-stone to independence <e> <s> a majority of people of the territory have voted for full sovereign independence <e> <s> this new status will enable antigua and barbuda to obtain aid and technical assistance from a wider range of international sources yet will permit an even wider participation in the regional fora such as the new organisation which the noble lord lord pitt mentioned <e> <s> the british governments relationship with antigua and barbuda will not of course end with the termination of association but will continue to be a close one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to confirm that without notice <e> <s> but i know that a member of the antigua government i think their equivalent of the chancellor of the exchequer was born in barbuda <e> <s> so that bears out what i was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the link therefore between the two islands is not simply a matter of history <e> <s> it involves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> the purpose of the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources is in particular to help to protect the stocks of krill a shrimp-like crustacean which is the principal foodstuff of antarctic whales thus reinforcing the protection already provided by the whaling convention <e> <s> the united kingdom signed that convention on th september of last year and it was laid before parliament on th april <e> <s> there are original signatories including the antarctic treaty consultative parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the final motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> in this atmosphere of obviously total confusion may i suggest that this would be an appropriate moment to adjourn the committee for minutes in order to have some dinner and some recharging of the batteries <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps this might be a convenient time to adjourn the committee stage <e> <s> i would suggest that we might reassemble at twenty minutes past eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both noble lords who have spoken for the very kind references that they have made to me personally <e> <s> i am only sorry that their welcome to this final stage of the bill was somewhat muted <e> <s> i have said often enough that the purpose of this little bill is very simple to enable the disposal of up to per cent <e> <s> of amershams shares and while we are at it to clarify the present disposal powers of the secretary of state and the atomic energy authority to sell shares in other companies although there are no plans to do that at the moment <e>", "<cs> would this be a convenient moment to resume the house for other business <e>", "<cs> my lords talks under united nations auspices have resumed following the greek and turkish cypriot elections <e> <s> progress before the elections was limited prospects now seem brighter but progress will require real determination from the parties <e> <s> we shall continue to give our full support to the united nations efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer to the noble lord the united nations efforts are very much the key to this situation and we see no case for unilateral initiatives but are giving our full support to the united nations efforts <e> <s> with regard to the first two supplementaries i agree that there have been some very hopeful signs notably the agreement on missing persons and it is encouraging that after months the two sides are still talking <e> <s> with elections out of the way there is a real and continuing opportunity for progress and we hope it will be exploited by all the parties <e> <s> with expectations on all sides running high i must point out that the talks are now at a delicate stage and i do not think that your lordships would expect me to comment too much upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that the withdrawal of turkish troops is an important issue but there are others and i think the problem would be unlikely to be solved in isolation <e> <s> there is no practical alternative to finding a settlement through inter-communal negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords aid is given evenhandedly in this case and we have official dealings only with the republic of cyprus under president kyprianou <e> <s> we do not however neglect the rights and interests of the turkish cypriot community <e> <s> as i say it is very important to talk and deal equally with both sides on the island of cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for increasing the effect of my answer to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord hatch <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misunderstood the noble lords question <e> <s> i am afraid i have no information on that point because it is not directly contiguous with the question <e> <s> if i may i will take the opportunity to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that i would write to the noble lord lord hatch when i have considered it and that is exactly what i shall do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the governments wish that the transcription services should be wound up merely that the annual contribution of some million from the grant-in-aid should cease <e> <s> we hope that the bbc external services will be able to continue to sell some of their recorded radio programmes to overseas countries and find alternative means of finance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps we ought to be rather certain in this particular case exactly what we are talking about <e> <s> the transcription services as the noble lord will be well aware include music drama light entertainment education and scientific material <e> <s> it is the governments view that it would seem more appropriate that sources of finance other than that of the foreign and commonwealth office should be found for those parts <e> <s> after all the fco is entirely concerned with foreign policy questions <e> <s> there are also some news and current affairs programmes specially made by what is known as the topical tape service <e> <s> this will continue to receive some a year from the grant-in-aid <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with the cultural value of this but what i would not agree with it that this service should be financed from the grant-in-aid from the foreign and commonwealth office <e> <s> i am glad the noble lord mentioned the british council because this is exactly one of the sources that are being looked at for aid <e> <s> but of course this is a matter for the board of the british council and we do not yet know what they may or may not decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the governments attitude and position on this matter was perfectly clear but i would remind the house the noble lord lord strabolgi will need no reminding that we are to have a full debate on this subject on thursday of next week <e> <s> my noble friend the foreign secretary will be speaking on this matter and so i believe shall i <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be naive but i really cannot see why the transcription services should be threatened with extinction as the original question suggested <e> <s> i do not think this is a matter of shuffling off <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord would expect me or would himself expect to pre-empt the decision of this house next week <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour perhaps i may reply briefly to the terms of the noble lords question <e> <s> i should like to express to him the appreciation of the house for the very accurate manner in which he has dealt with the history of the problem that we are now discussing <e> <s> what the noble lord is essentially asking is what is the present position of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in these circumstances and referring to the terms of lord northfields question it would not seem either appropriate or helpful for her majestys government now to play an active role in this controversy <e> <s> we are naturally concerned that it should not be allowed to develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as i am about to say this was agreed between my honourable friend the minister of state mr ridley and the belizean prime minister mr price at discussions last week <e> <s> at this stage i would not want to anticipate that statement <e> <s> if the noble lord wants me to of course i would be prepared to do so <e>", "<cs> no i understand that in independence bills this is perfectly normal <e> <s> i believe that one of the most recent to come before your lordships house was the zimbabwe independence bill <e> <s> this matter is not included in the bill but is in the special procedure which goes before her majesty in council <e> <s> we are not doing anything different in this bill from what we have done in the past <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that it would be for the convenience of the committee if we discussed this with the appropriate amendments rather than at this point <e> <s> however i am in the committees hands on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for having moved this amendment <e> <s> since there have been changes in the position since i spoke to you on this matter on second reading i welcome the opportunity now to give the committee details of what has been agreed with the government of belize <e> <s> premier price of belize and my honourable friend the minister of state have as i told the house a few minutes ago discussed on nd july the arrangements to be made after independence on st september for the defence of belize <e>", "<cs> for some considerable time i have been trying like a fish slice to get a word in edgeways <e> <s> may i first say to the committee that in the statement the phrase appropriate measures was used as the noble lord lord stewart of fulham rightly recognised and the same phrase is in the amendment <e> <s> from that point of view there is nothing in the statement or in the amendment which contradicts each other <e> <s> but and it is a big but i am advised by my legal department that this amendment is open-ended in time <e> <s> there have been various arguments backwards and forwards as to whether it is open-ended or not and i am advised that it is <e> <s> furthermore it casts fundamental doubts on the scope of the executive <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord goes as far as that may i ask him to look at the bill <e> <s> he will see that under clause the constitution has to be presented in the form of an order in council <e> <s> this also refers to the definitive date of independence day <e> <s> my understanding is that the present plan is that a single combined order for these two facts will be made on friday st july assuming royal assent by this time <e> <s> friday is the last privy council of this session and i am told that if we miss it it will be necessary to have a special sitting of the privy council to do this and it would then be likely that we would miss the belizeans preferred date for independence st september <e>", "<cs> it was not ever my intention to come into this chamber this afternoon and treat your lordships committee or indeed any other proceedings in your lordships house with any sort of disparagement <e> <s> i would never intend to do that i can tell my noble friend <e> <s> but regarding the first part of his argument i am advised very strongly that any amendment would mean that the bill would have to go back to another place and we have all accepted that and there is then great danger in missing the belizeans own preferred date for independence <e> <s> i should perhaps point out to the committee that the belize government have been elected consistently on an independence platform <e> <s> this was reaffirmed in the general election of and again i understand this was backed up by the local council elections in belize city where approximately half the population live where the government party was returned with an overwhelming <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend were to do that and the committee were to follow his advice i must advise your lordships that what i said originally still stands <e> <s> this amendent is legally defective and these words could not be enforced by any court of law <e> <s> as a matter of law they add practically nothing to the bill which is not added by an exchange of notes which <e>", "<cs> the nationality clauses of this bill follow generally the pattern of previous independence legislation <e> <s> they provide that people deriving their citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies from a connection with belize should lose that citizenship unless they have a close connection with the united kingdom or a remaining dependency <e> <s> under the belize independence constitution people closely connected with belize through their own or a parents birth naturalisation or registration in belize will become citizens of that country <e> <s> those whose connection is through a grandparent will also become citizens of belize provided that they have no other citizenship for example that of neighbouring guatemala or honduras <e>", "<cs> the question of a referendum has aroused tremendous interest both in this house and outside it and in belize and it is quite right that it should <e> <s> however what the noble baroness lady jeger said in her very helpful and constructive speech is absolutely right <e> <s> it is not for the british government the british parliament or for anybody else to impose upon the government of belize or the people of belize a referendum in the way suggested by this amendment <e> <s> i am able to tell your lordships because i had the opportunity to meet premier price last week that he is sticking by what he has always said that there will be a referendum in belize on the terms of a treaty when a treaty is to be signed <e> <s> he has never promised a referendum on the independence issue because he feels this is his political judgment that in two general elections to which i have already referred he had a mandate from the people of belize <e> <s> the first was well before the heads of agreement were even thought of <e> <s> for all i know it may not even have been an idea in the mind of god <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> what i am suggesting to the committee is that mr price had a mandate on independence irrespective of the heads of agreement <e> <s> we now know though i did not know when i made my second reading speech to your lordships that the discussions on a treaty following the heads of agreement were at that stage not in any way postponed <e> <s> that i am afraid is the situation we are in today <e> <s> nevertheless when there is a treaty there will be a referendum <e> <s> that is the referendum which mr price has consistently talked about <e>", "<cs> we are discussing an amendment <e> <s> i will certainly speak to the noble lord on the heads of agreement <e> <s> one of the questions which the noble lord lord avebury asked me was about human rights in guatemala <e> <s> of course the government are very much aware from a variety of reports of the disquieting situation that pertains so far as human rights are concerned in guatemala <e> <s> and of course we very strongly support the observance of full human and democratic rights there <e> <s> however as the guatemalan government broke off diplomatic relations with the united kingdom in over belize we are not usually in a position to make direct representations to them <e> <s> nevertheless we have consistently pressed at the united nations and in other international fora for the adequate protection of human rights throughout the world and will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> no it does not mean that because the heads of agreement are still on the table and have not yet been broken off <e>", "<cs> i accept that at present there is no treaty but the heads of agreement are still on the table and i have no doubt that discussions upon them will be resumed <e> <s> i should certainly hate to use the expression the discussions in new york have broken down over this particular treaty <e> <s> in return guatemala would have received guaranteed access to the high seas through its own territorial waters the use and enjoyment of the two southernmost cays on the belizean barrier reef as well as free port facilities in belize and transit facilities through belizean territory for imports and exports <e> <s> belize and guatemala were to collaborate on a range of matters of mutual concern <e>", "<cs> this may well happen but i personally have not had confirmed reports of it <e> <s> all i said was that standing here in your lordships committee it seemed to me that the situation was a little bit strange to say the least though this is something which happens in various parts of the world <e> <s> i said that it is odd that they should have rioted against the heads of agreement and that now they are apparently rioting when there is no treaty on the heads of agreement <e> <s> i really do not understand it <e>", "<cs> it is not anything of the sort <e> <s> the government are giving force to the wishes of belize which is what i said in the beginning <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the sentiments expressed by the noble lord but again may i be allowed to tell the committee that it was the belize governments intention to have independence on st september <e> <s> i did in a way forewarn the house on second reading when i said that this may be as soon as mid-september the words are there in black and white <e> <s> so i do not think i have added much to misleading the house <e> <s> if i have i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that the bill do now pass i appreciate that while certain reservations have understandably been expressed today in relation to belizes transition to independence in what we must all acknowledge are less than ideal circumstances i hope that the replies i have given have been sufficient to reassure the house that belizes long overdue independence should not be any longer delayed <e> <s> despite the fact that the dispute with guatemala remains unresolved and that guatemala has reserved its position we are confident that the understanding and goodwill established during negotiations over the past year or so will survive the transition and will provide the basis for successful negotiations in due course <e> <s> in the meantime belize will join the united nations organisation and the commonwealth and will become an established member of the international community of nations <e> <s> this in itself will give belize a very considerable measure of security and the measures which we shall be taking in agreement with the government of belize will underpin this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all members of the house who have spoken on this motion <e> <s> i am sure that the people of belize will be very pleased to receive their good wishes for their forthcoming independence <e> <s> my noble friend lady vickers has asked me about british aid <e> <s> i am afraid that i am unable at this moment to give precise figures on this matter <e> <s> figures for british aid following independence have yet to be decided but aid will continue for a number of years and we are considering a suitable package <e> <s> this was discussed in general terms with mr price during his visit last week <e> <s> there will be further detailed discussions with the belize government <e> <s> i should add that there will be no difference in this aid package from similar aid packages which we have given in similar circumstances in the past <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that at this hour of the night it would be very helpful for me to go over the ancient history as it were which was so ably described by the noble lord lord hatch in his introduction to this small debate on his unstarred question on the governments attitude to the future of namibia <e> <s> however it would be fair to say that despite the setback over the disappointing failure of the geneva talks in january this year the five have not abandoned their efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords the point which the noble lord lord brockway has raised is still very much under consideration but as i have tried to explain over the whole gamut of my remarks this evening there is still a long way to go before we get to that point and to that extent at least there is time still to make up our minds on that proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the madrid meeting has recessed until th october <e> <s> it will then aim to reach agreement on a substantial and balanced final document by mid-december <e> <s> although language has been provisionally registered in the areas of human contacts culture education and economic co-operation agreement has still to be reached on human rights and military security questions which remain under negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords during the period when the conference is in recess there will of course be considerable consultations and that is certainly one of the points that will be consulted upon <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will know the government strongly believe that any individual or organisation has the right to monitor their or other governments compliance with the provisions of the final act <e> <s> we have pressed and shall continue to press at madrid and elsewhere for an end to the deplorable practice to which my noble friend referred and in answer to him i should say that strong pressure is still required <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we shall most certainly continue to look at that matter and keep up the pressure <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly agree that the military aspect is the key to these entire negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords while these discussions are going on to a certain extent they remain confidential until an agreement has been reached <e> <s> however i am able to tell the noble and learned lord what has been achieved <e> <s> one of our major objectives was to conduct a frank and thorough exchange of views on the way in which participating states had implemented the provisions of the helsinki final act in the period since the belgrade review meeting <e> <s> that review took place in the six-week period before the christmas recess and enabled the british as well as western neutral and non-aligned delegations to draw attention to serious violations of final act provisions relating to human rights as well as the soviet invasion of afghanistan <e> <s> since then in the course of negotiations on a final document provisional agreement has been registered in the areas of human contacts family reunification and information and economic exchanges <e> <s> those texts represent an advance on commitments to the helsinki final act and i hope that information is of help to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i have listened to and learned from the noble lord lord brockway and most certainly i shall take his point under review as i do indeed all his points <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord spens for explaining to us his amendment no <e> <s> and for speaking at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am afraid that there has been much misapprehension in regard to page line column over the fact that the words republic of appear there at all <e> <s> i hope to be able to show that there is a very simple reason for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i perhaps should inform my noble friend that manuscript amendments are not allowed on third reading of bills <e>", "<cs> my lords we are already doing so <e> <s> we are taking part in consultations which are already under way in geneva between interested governments and agencies under the auspices of the international committee of the red cross and the united nations high commissioner for refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate the tenor of my noble friends supplementary question and of course we deplore these particularly brutal attacks <e> <s> we are satisfied that the other two governments which my noble friend did not mention that is the thai government and the malaysian government are very conscious of the gravity of the situation and we welcome the steps already taken by those governments to control piracy in their own waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the details referred to in the question raised by the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> however if he would like to furnish me with the relevant details i shall most certainly bring the matter to the attention of not only the consultations in geneva but also of course my right honourable and noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course consider the most interesting suggestion put forward by the noble lord lord shinwell in the second part of his supplementary question <e> <s> however so far as the red cross is concerned i understand that the red cross is included in the talks in geneva because it is that organisation which deals with the effects of the piracy rather than the piracy itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have no information on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords before going further on this i must inform the house that there is a series of misprints on the marshalled list in this series of amendments moved by my noble friend <e> <s> they are amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> only half of these amendments have been printed and all should read leave out citizenship of the british dependent territories and insert british dependent territories citizenship <e> <s> i must apologise for this omission not only from the marshalled list but from our presentation of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord boothby will forgive me i think that the house by general consent has come to a conclusion on this matter on the advice of the noble lord lord byers <e>", "<cs> my lords rates of supplement have been reviewed annually <e> <s> in certain countries for which recruitment and retention of staff present little difficulty the payment of an inducement as part of a supplement for serving overseas has been discontinued or reduced for new contracts <e> <s> regulations on advance of salaries at the beginning of new contracts have been relaxed to some extent <e> <s> no major changes are planned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the reason for the payment of supplements is that they should act in part as an inducement to persuade people to serve in countries overseas <e> <s> what i did not say however was that these supplements are based on what are called analogues the object of which is to bring the level of pay in the country to which they are going up to the corresponding level of pay in this country assuming that the aid would be payable in some form for the job anyway <e> <s> the noble lord referred particularly in the case of zambia to the reduction in supplementation schemes <e> <s> this is likely to happen anyway wherever in the world they are paid because the whole object of the exercise is to get the local people in the host countries to fill the jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i appreciate the need for experts but as i was saying just now as the experts fulfil their role and create local experts the need for foreign experts must of its very nature be reduced <e> <s> however the increasingly specialised nature of many remaining posts will ensure that there is a need for external assistance of this kind for a number of years and to that extent i would agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we already provide a lot of assistance to central africa in the transport field <e> <s> in the specific case of zambia we part fund the costs of some british experts who work for the government of zambia in the transport sector and are considering meeting the capital costs of a rail bridge over the kafue river <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we were told quite as much as the noble lord would lead us to expect from his supplementary question <e> <s> however it is true that the chinese offered tremendous aid and assistance both technical and monetary in building a railway between tanzania and zimbabwe <e> <s> i know that both these countries have managed to reschedule their debts in this connection but i cannot tell the noble lord the details of such <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i was aware of that <e> <s> this is something which is currently under discussion during our presidency of the eec <e> <s> the point that is sometimes missed in all this is that although as the noble baroness has said the aid was promised quite a lot of this is rescheduling of existing bilateral aid <e>", "<cs> my lord i regret that i shall have to write on that subject to the noble lord <e> <s> i have no information on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something that we could look at but i do not think that it is practicable under current legislation because aid by the direction of parliament must be given directly to the governments concerned <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> eleven years ago i was a volunteer in zambia where i was advising on the growing of tropical fruit and vegetables <e> <s> transport was then one of the major problems and i understand from my advisers that it is so still and it is one of the things which gets priority <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i have already tried to explain that i do not hold that view <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the foreign and commonwealth office will consider any suggestion which comes from your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords exploration wells have been drilled this year <e> <s> in addition seven exploration wells were being drilled as at th november the last date for which there are figures <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said to-date this year in and in <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that we are aware of that at all <e> <s> the indications are that far from slowing down the number of exploration wells being drilled they are increasing as i said in my original answer to my noble friend <e> <s> we therefore have no reason at all to believe that the introduction of any new fiscal arrangements is having any significant effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware that there are two submissions from the oil companies currently being examined in whitehall both by my own department and by the treasury <e> <s> these are the ukooa ones which i think my noble friend has in mind in asking his supplementary question and also the brindex one <e> <s> i rather think that this goes a little wide of the question on the order paper which refers to exploration wells rather than production or any other form of well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give that breakdown <e> <s> but of course as the house will know one is never quite sure which one will find or indeed whether one will find both together <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the admission of private capital into bnoc makes any difference at all <e> <s> each petroleum production licence granted carries an agreed work programme stipulating the minimum number of wells to be drilled in the initial term of the licence <e> <s> we believe that the removal of bnoc privileges has helped to stimulate drilling activity which we expect to see further encouraged by privatisation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am certainly aware of the views of the chairman of the bnoc in this connection <e> <s> i must say i agree with him and i would hope that other nationalised concerns saw the situation in the same light as he does <e> <s> as far as employment prospects in offshore supplies are concerned there are really two different points here which perhaps i ought to make <e> <s> there is currently a shortage of rigs in the north sea meaning that foreign rigs may well come in <e> <s> that might mean a decline in the united kingdoms share of those rigs but not a decline in employment since those people currently working will remain and depending on the origin of foreign rigs this could well mean an increase in employment of our own labour <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure that this will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord bellwin will repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on assistance for the private sector steel industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the object of this money bill is to raise the financial limit of british nuclear fuels limited <e> <s> the limit was set out at million by the nuclear industry finance act with powers to raise this to million <e> <s> these powers were exercised by statutory instrument which came up for discussion in another place on th march last <e> <s> on that occasion the opposition view that we should put bnfls financial limit much higher in order to avoid the need for frequent return to parliament for further authority weighed heavily with us <e> <s> the bill therefore raises the limit further to million with powers to increase this to million again by order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the very moderate way in which they have greeted this bill <e> <s> my last excursion onto the nuclear front was in june and july of this year when the liberal party represented on that occasion not by the noble lord lord beaumont but by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran was somewhat more forthright than the noble lord has been this afternoon <e> <s> in fact i must confess that a rather wicked thought went through my mind <e> <s> i wondered whether the liberal party had not to misquote portia turned a manly stride into two mincing steps <e> <s> however we shall see <e>", "<cs> that misses the point completely my lords <e> <s> the company does not get a government guarantee until it has convinced the financial institutions <e> <s> that is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the gross aid programme for will continue to be over one billion pounds and the net programme will be million <e> <s> this is a reduction of just under million below the previously planned figure plus a further reduction of million to compensate for an overspend of the same amount in <e> <s> in addition the commonwealth development corporation may borrow abroad up to million in each of the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords no he could not confirm anything of the sort <e> <s> the planned expenditure as in supply estimates for was million for it was million for it was million and for it will be million <e> <s> i said in my original answer that the commonwealth development corporation may borrow up to million in each of the next three years <e> <s> in the noble lords question we are dealing only with one year but even with my shaky mathematics million and million make million which is an increase in the expenditure figure of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot promise any particular breakdown of the total aid figure <e> <s> it will depend on circumstances at the time not only within the overall aid budget but within our own economic climate <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always said that aid depends on our economic performance in other fields <e> <s> the governments first priority must remain to put our own economy to rights <e> <s> that entails controlling public expenditure of which the aid programme is a part <e> <s> but this relatively small reduction and the additional allocation to the commonwealth development corporation reflect the governments commitment to maintaining a substantial programme of assistance to developing countries <e> <s> so i do not believe that what i have said now is in any way inconsistent with what my right honourable and honourable friends have been saying around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have been caught on the hop by that question i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on what you mean by cut <e> <s> i prefer to look at it as a reduction in the budget estimate which is no cut in my book <e>", "<cs> my lords yes this has been under consideration for some time but i am afraid that i am not able to give the noble lord any concrete facts at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord morris for the opportunity to discuss this wide-ranging and interesting topic which is of such great importance not only to us in britain but also to the people of the falkland islands <e> <s> we are also grateful to the noble lord for putting that dependency in its geographical context <e> <s> i am also personally grateful that the great expertise of the noble lord lord shackleton not only on the falkland islands but on the working of your lordships house has been brought out to help us in our debate this evening <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord said in his opening remarks regarding my noble friend <e> <s> i too suffer from exuberance being a young man and i would say to my noble friend that in his exuberance perhaps he went a little too far <e> <s> it is neither correct nor fair to attribute to officials responsibility for decisions taken by the government of the day <e> <s> the noble lords suggestion that members of the public should telephone certain foreign and commonwealth office officials about hms endurance was therefore misdirected <e> <s> the decision on hms endurance was taken by ministers and any representation should be addressed to them through members of parliament or directly <e> <s> since not surprisingly practically every noble lord has this evening referred to the subject of hms endurance i shall come back to that in a minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that point is taken <e> <s> i was trying to do a little encapsulation and if i unintentionally misled the house in so doing i apologise <e> <s> in this connection the noble lord lord morris asked what action the government will take if drilling commences on the falkland side of the line <e> <s> i should answer him with some care that we shall deal with the situation if and when it arises but we need to protect our rights and the interests of the islanders <e>", "<cs> no my lords they cannot also operate helicopters <e>", "<cs> no my lords i suggested that an argument had been advanced <e> <s> i did not pretend to suggest that it had been advanced by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill gives powers to introduce private capital into the oil-producing business of bnoc <e> <s> it enables the corporation to establish a subsidiary to be named britoil and to transfer all its oil-producing business to it if the secretary of state approves <e> <s> subject to the progress of the bill through parliament the government hope to establish britoil as an operating concern in the autumn <e> <s> initially per cent <e> <s> of the shares will be offered for sale as soon as market conditions allow which we hope will be before the end of the year <e> <s> bnoc itself will continue in being trading primarily in participation oil <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that the bill received its second reading in another place last week <e> <s> due to the great interest of your lordships in this subject i have unusually seen that notes on clauses are already available in the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with my noble friend in the first part of that supplementary question <e> <s> while in the public sector bnocs financial requirements which will not always remain within the size of its internally generated resources must compete with other claims on the public purse thus stunting the spirit of enterprise privatisation will allow britoil to finance its operations free of the public sector <e>", "<cs> i would agree that bnoc has a very fine record my lords but i would not agree that there is any necessity at all for the public sector in britain to be concerned with the vast capital requirements of north sea oil operations <e> <s> i should point out to the house that of the total north sea operation only per cent <e> <s> is in bnocs hands <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords the government have studied this in depth and we have come to the conclusion that we do not agree with many of the remarks that the noble lord has just made <e> <s> as i said earlier bnoc is responsible for only per cent <e> <s> of current north sea production with over per cent <e> <s> of the remainder efficiently in the hands of the private sector <e> <s> our oil and gas resources which i think is the point that the noble lord is getting at are vested in the nation by virtue of the petroleum production act and the continental shelf act <e> <s> oil companies whether in the public or the private sector act as licensees of government in developing these resources <e> <s> there is no loss of a national asset and i shall not he accused of the rape of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> naturally we shall keep very <e>", "<cs> my lords through the participation agreements up to per cent <e> <s> will continue to be offered for sale to bnoc and i think that this is the defensive role that the government ought rightly to require bnoc to play <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see the purchase and sale of assets by a private individual or a nation as being at all improper <e> <s> the nation raised the capital to put into the nationalised industries <e> <s> why on earth when the circumstances are right should it not free this capital for other uses <e>", "<cs> yes my lords naturally we do not want any single company to gain control of britoil <e> <s> a scheme is currently being worked out through the articles of association and this will be presented to parliament when it has been worked out <e> <s> i would hope that this will take place during the passage of the bill through one or other of the two houses <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly <e> <s> we have a depletion policy which affects equally the private sector and the public sector <e> <s> it is going to make not one scrap of difference <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl asking a question he is to speak shortly or is he pre-empting himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is the first major debate in this house under the present government which has dealt specifically with oil and gas matters <e> <s> the debate demonstrated that considerable experience and expertise of the oil and gas industries which exists in this house <e> <s> whatever our respective views are about the bill and very naturally there are differences both between the parties and individual members within each party it has given rise to an interesting and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> there have been many excellent speeches for which i am truly grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships would all agree that it would be better if the noble lord considered his answer and would be good enough to give it to us at some later stage <e> <s> i should now like to go on to emphasise three points about the bill <e> <s> first the powers to dispose of bnocs oil-producing business and to provide in the first instance for the disposal of the british gas corporations north sea oil assets are important changes <e> <s> i appreciate that change however necessary is rarely welcome to everybody but there is a clear need to reduce the size of the public sector <e> <s> this is especially so where there is no justification for direct state involvement in oil exploration and production <e> <s> it will therefore be a major step forward in reducing the size of the public sector <e> <s> i have been asked about the timing about valuation and how much the sale would raise <e> <s> i must say that unless any noble lord objects i intend to regard these as committee points <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it asset stripping happens in the conventional sense and i am sure the noble lord lord bruce is poised to correct me and it occurs where one company buys another company strips off its assets and then sells it <e> <s> this cannot happen here no my lords it cannot happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very generous <e> <s> i think perhaps i will have to take up this matter with him afterwards <e> <s> he also mentioned as did other noble lords the matter of steam raising through the use of gas <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord and of the house to section of the energy act which governs the use of gas in power stations and is unaffected by this bill <e> <s> section implements our obligations under an eec directive which expresses the premise that in general the use of gas in power stations is undesirable <e> <s> while some of our eec partners use large volumes of gas in electricity generation we in britain have avoided this and have used gas in power stations only where as the noble lord said such use has a particular value as an interruptible supply assisting the security of gas supplies to non-interruptible consumers <e> <s> there are in fact two not one power stations which are currently taking such supplies <e> <s> at present the gas comes from the bgc but in future it could come from private suppliers <e> <s> in both cases section of the energy act will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords bnoc as an entity has been doing two jobs and we do not accept that the two jobs should continue to be done by one organisation within the public sector <e> <s> i should now like to look briefly at some of the gas provisions in this bill <e> <s> the introduction of competition in place of monopoly in the purchase and supply of gas will benefit consumers not only in the short-term by allowing consumers particularly large industrial consumers a choice of suppliers but also in the longer term by stimulating gas exploration and production <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the inter-governmental maritime consultative organisation immunities and privileges amendment order be approved <e> <s> the words inter-governmental maritime consultative organisation being rather a mouthful i hope the house will allow me on this occasion to use the acronym imco throughout in my few words on the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bishopston for his reception of the order <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me one or two questions <e> <s> i think that perhaps i dealt with his question about traffic and road legislation in my original introduction <e> <s> the answer is that immunities are not confirmed for that <e> <s> the noble lord also asked how the immunities of the personnel of such missions differ from diplomatic immunities <e> <s> the answer is again as i think i said originally that the immunities in this case are only for official acts in the normal course of the duties of those personnel whereas diplomats are exempt all the time whatever they are doing <e> <s> therefore it is a very minor form of immunity and privilege <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be an appropriate time to take the statements <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this seems an appropriate moment at which to adjourn the committee stage <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords while the israeli withdrawal from sinai has been successfully completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i have not seen in the flesh the two reports to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> however i have read synopses of both of them and in the main the government agree with them with of course the everlasting proviso that both sides recognise one another in this dispute <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we on these benches would certainly like to echo the sentiments of the noble baroness opposite <e> <s> for my part i find it very strange to be discussing this subject without the benefit of the noble lords advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have been misunderstood <e> <s> i did not mean to give the impression that camp david was not continuing <e> <s> it is by no means finished it is still going on <e>", "<cs> i would not agree with that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i have already made clear we and the ten stick very firmly to the venice principles and fresh ideas from all the parties concerned are i would agree now needed if progress is to be made towards a comprehensive peace settlement <e> <s> we and our european partners are ready to play our part in this and we keep our policy constantly under review in the light of developments <e> <s> however as i said at the beginning of the question we continue to believe that the principles of the venice declaration provide the best option at the moment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with that but of course the great problem is that politics and people all over the world do not necessarily go together <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we are delighted that the fahad principles ever came about <e> <s> as a government we are very pleased that diplomatic activity should come from the area concerned and this is right <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend that any reconvening of for example the fahad conference is a matter for the arab states themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the time is yet ripe to call a world conference in the conditions the world is in at the moment <e> <s> i will take advice on the point raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of that but i think the noble baroness has come to rather greater conclusions than the facts warrant in this matter <e>", "<cs> we may have got into some slight muddle at this point <e> <s> the amendment to the amendment has been withdrawn but i know that the noble lord lord bishopston would like to have an answer from my noble friend in reply to his point before deciding on what action to take on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> this would seem an appropriate moment to adjourn for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that the committee reassembles at eight oclock if that suits the convenience of the opposition <e>", "<cs> we now arrive at that part of the bill which makes amendment to the gas act so as to control the position of non-bgc gas agreed to in principle in clause which we have been discussing <e> <s> the first of the noble lords amendments seeks to extend the consultation requirements in the new section b so as to cover not only british gas but also such organisations and persons as the secretary of state considers appropriate <e> <s> from what he was saying i can understand exactly what he is worried about <e> <s> i hope by my remarks to dispel those particular worries <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to say so there has been considerable consultation with the chemical industry and with the association which represents it <e> <s> the trouble is that the association started off before the committee stage of this bill in another place <e> <s> they were then replied to but they did virtually nothing between that time and this <e> <s> but we will certainly seek to explain about such worries as they have had <e> <s> indeed when they get around to reading the <e>", "<cs> i thought that in virtually every sentence i uttered the word safety was included so for the noble lord to assert that i dismiss safety out of hand is really not very fair <e> <s> i accept the criticism made by the noble lord lord underhill that i did not answer the questions he put <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord for not doing so <e>", "<cs> i do not have the precise number for scotland but i can tell the noble lord lord ross of marnock that the number of people in scotland is included in the figure of at the gas standards branch <e> <s> the noble lord can make of that what he wishes but that was the information he asked for <e>", "<cs> it will be a very rare occurrence if indeed it is ever allowed to happen that private suppliers will be allowed to supply the domestic market <e> <s> the only time that i can think of when such an occasion might arise will be when the principal supply is to a factory and the factory has in effect tied cottages around it <e> <s> perhaps the term tied cottages is an emotive one and i should not have used it i mean cottages which have been built to house employees of the factory in question <e> <s> in those circumstances i can understand the secretary of state giving his consent to the supply of gas to both the factory and the outlying cottages <e> <s> but as a general rule i cannot see that private supplies to private consumers on this small scale will be either necessary or desirable <e>", "<cs> the bill provides the secretary of state with powers to make statutory arrangements for the safety matters as far as gas supply is concerned <e> <s> noble lords on that side who have all got much more experience of government than i have would surely not expect the bill go go into detail of what in effect would be subordinate legislation at this stage in parliamentary discussion <e>", "<cs> i accept the closing remarks of the noble lord lord bishopston that we must all know where we are and i shall seek to give the noble lord lord tanlaw the assurance for which he asked namely that there is an even-handed approach to safety depending on whether one is talking about the <e>", "<cs> no indeed it is not in the bill <e> <s> as i was trying to explain the point is that we are talking about two sets of individuals in essence doing <e>", "<cs> i must get to the bottom of this <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross says that the officials of the gas standards branch should be paid <e> <s> he is presumably referring to their being paid by the private sector for the work that they do for them <e> <s> we on these benches have been encouraged to have an evenhanded approach <e> <s> are we to charge british gas for the same service <e> <s> if not i cannot see the force of the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord davies of leek on two things <e> <s> at the risk of infuriating one noble lord and of your lordships castigating me for being contrary i should like to start with the second one <e> <s> since your lordships started short debates nine years ago they have proved to be a most valuable addition to the routine of your lordships house but they were limited to one day a month <e> <s> speaking as a minor capillary i suppose among the usual channels i am delighted that the noble lord has helped to persuade his colleagues that a day set aside for a main opposition back-bench debate should be split into two parts so that we can debate two most useful subjects in place of the usual one <e> <s> i hope that noble lords on all sides of the house will see that today a precedent has been set one which we on this bench would like to see repeated in the not-too-distant future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree but what i was trying to say was that a lot can happen in the space of years and as various speakers have pointed out a lot has happened in the space of the last years <e> <s> the noble lord lord paget referred to the last years so we are talking about a time-scale all the time and i think that should be borne in mind <e> <s> but there has been progress particularly in the last years in reducing the rate of population growth <e> <s> fertility rates have fallen in a wide spectrum of countries with substantially different cultural social and religious settings <e> <s> this slackening in the rate of global population growth at the end of the s represented an achievement on the part of developed countries international aid agencies and non-governmental organisations working in the population sector <e> <s> but most of all it was an achievement on the part of those developing countries which saw the threat that increasing populations presented to their economic and social development <e> <s> my noble friend lord gisborough and indeed the motion itself as the noble lord lord oram said put flesh on the bones of this rather bald statement which i am afraid i do not have time to elaborate upon <e> <s> the noble viscount lord craigavon said there was some ground for optimism since he had last spoken shortly before the colombo conference <e> <s> i agree that there is some ground for optimism but there is still a great deal to be desired <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to the practicalities a little later in my speech if the noble lord will be patient with me <e> <s> we cannot however afford to be complacent since the trend towards lower growth rates needs continuing reinforcement and assistance <e> <s> i suspect that we may have seen success in only some of the areas which are easier to address and that major difficulties remain in tackling effectively the more intractable problems <e> <s> the noble lord lord davies mentioned the older generation and i know that the idea of an old-age pension in third world countries is being considered <e> <s> however i must emphasise that whatever scheme is decided upon and i address this directly to the noble lord lord paget must be right for a particular country at a particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is pre-empting me again <e> <s> i wish he would not and would let me finish my speech in my own way <e> <s> then if he would like to cross-question me i should be delighted to respond <e> <s> on the bilateral side i was not talking about the bilateral side before we hope to spend million on population during this calendar year <e> <s> this i think is a partial answer to the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> but i must tell her and the noble lord lord caradon that we have done more <e> <s> in about per cent <e> <s> or million of the gross aid programmes estimated expenditure is likely to have been spent on population as such <e> <s> it is too early to provide a percentage for but we expect the expenditure to be in the region of million including a rise of some per cent <e> <s> on bilateral aid <e>", "<cs> most certainly my lords <e> <s> i omitted to say that i knew there were various points that i had missed and had not had time to reply to in my speech <e> <s> i will most certainly write <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be aware that shell and esso have recently announced their decision to defer further design and development work on the tern oilfield <e> <s> this proposal has not been formally submitted to the department of energy <e> <s> no proposal which has been formally submitted has been deferred recently <e>", "<cs> my lords it is inevitable that in the light of lower oil prices licensees will be more cautious in appraising the current generation of smaller more complex reservoirs before reaching development decisions <e> <s> i ask your lordships to keep this matter in proportion because there are three things which affect the decisions of the oil companies <e> <s> first the <e>", "<cs> my lords the ukooa organisation is currently in correspondence with my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer on exactly this matter <e> <s> the government are looking into this <e> <s> i repeat what i have said several times in your lordships house the last budget statement of my right honourable and learned friend said that the position of taxes is now stable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not true that very little action has been taken <e> <s> there has been correspondence in the past six weeks and this correspondence is still going on <e> <s> i admit that the ball is currently in my right honourable and learned friends court but i do not think that the house can draw any allusions from that at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords again referring to the budget statement we realise that a constant yoyoing of forms of tax is neither necessary nor desirable <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend has said that the new regime would be stable and i cannot take it any further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the stability i was referring to was not the stability of death at all but the stability of types of tax <e> <s> there is an argument on the rate of tax and i accept that this is what the correspondence is all about <e> <s> so far as the offshore construction industry is concerned to which my noble friend was referring i think i admit that in the absence of further major orders this industry is likely to suffer redundancies <e> <s> few major orders are expected from the united kingdom sector of the north sea in the next months <e> <s> united kingdom companies however may be able to compete for other sectors of the north sea if they are prepared to accept that final assembly takes place elsewhere <e> <s> i would expect other export opportunities to offer additional employment but i must tell the house that i would expect this to be only at the fully skilled engineering level <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that the two things are in the slightest bit connected <e> <s> noble lords will know that the offshore production part of bnoc is shortly to become a private company and i would expect the new company britoil to be part of ukooa at comparatively short notice <e>", "<cs> my lords at this moment i am afraid i cannot help my noble friend any further except to say that the rates of taxation are always under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the length of this answer the reasons for which will become apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend on his first point that as recent experience has shown a close connection with the commonwealth has proved valuable <e> <s> however i do not share his criticism of the treasury <e> <s> the treasury is far from being an ogre <e> <s> they have a difficult job to do in difficult economic circumstances <e> <s> recent statistics have shown that we led by them are winning the battle against inflation <e> <s> it has become almost my theme song over the last few weeks that when our economic fortunes have improved sufficiently we shall review with sympathy reductions in budget estimates which we have made since coming into office <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering my noble friends first point i did say that i agree that close connection with commonwealth countries is necessary and desirable and has proved its value over the last few months <e> <s> however i would stick by the second part of my answer to his supplementary that all this is dependent upon economic circumstances as indeed is borne out when i tell the noble lord lord gladwyn that we have increased the funds available for awards made under the commonwealth scholarship and fellowship plan to million in compared with million in <e> <s> we do have the interests of the student at heart <e>", "<cs> my lords may i tell the noble lord and it will be apparent when he reads my answer in the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords which is why in replying to the particular line of questioning which is being pursued in your lordships house at the moment i am answering for the government as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly bring the point made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> however i would point out that the contingency fund is for emergencies generally speaking and not for long standing problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the talks were warm and friendly and covered a wide range of subjects <e> <s> there was detailed discussion of the cyrpus governments claim for aid and a number of ideas were discussed <e> <s> there is no question of payment for the sovereign base areas which are sovereign british territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the noble baroness lady jeger has held this view for some considerable time <e> <s> i seem to recall that when she and i last discussed this particular subject she asked me whether i was aware that there was never an appropriate moment for the final solution of this problem so i know exactly her background thinking <e> <s> however the problems are very real and we still stick by the facts we have made plain that when we have a united nations seeking with the full authority of all the countries belonging to the united nations to do the right thing it would be counter-productive to take unilateral action cutting across what the united nations seeks to do <e>", "<cs> my lords when talking about this particular problem i must say that i find the subject of sovereign base areas something of a red herring <e> <s> sovereign base areas are sovereign british territory as i said in my original answer <e> <s> we have no intention of giving them up <e> <s> nor have the cyprus government ever suggested that they wish us to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord on the first part of his question because we are of course one of the guarantor powers for cyprus under the cyprus agreement <e> <s> but i cannot agree that we are taking no action in this matter <e> <s> britain has met all the obligations placed upon her and we are as the noble lord with his great experience of the subject will know the largest contributors of both men and money to the united nations peacekeeping force in cyprus at a cost of some million a year <e>", "<cs> i seem to have got quite a battering <e> <s> perhaps i should start by reminding the committee that what we are talking about is the gas in a pipe-line belonging to the british gas corporation <e> <s> the bgc already have gas in their own pipe-line and the maintenance of and statutory requirements applying to that gas will not change in any way <e> <s> we are talking about the same pipe-line operated by the same people <e> <s> the fact that it might also have private sector gas in it does not affect the position in any way and of that i assure the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put it in personal terms and i make no complaint about that <e> <s> if it is my gas he is talking about and i am a private supplier of gas then in order to come to a fair arrangement on the maintenance of my share of the pipe i would expect to pay in my rent an allowance for that eventuality <e>", "<cs> i hope i may be excused for answering the noble lord lord beswick a little later i am answering noble lords in reverse order and with a bit of luck i should get the right answers to the right questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers asked about the kind of gas and the noble lord lord ross said we would come to amendments on that very subject later and that is right <e> <s> however i would point out at this stage that to me anyway it is fairly evident that if there are two sorts of gas in the same pipeline they must be of similar calorific value of the same compatible type for which the pipe-line was originally designed otherwise it would be unsafe and under the bill the secretary of state is given reserve powers to ensure that that is so he will do nothing under the bill to make the transmission of gas by pipe-line unsafe <e>", "<cs> that was a rather fast ball because as the noble lord lord ross reminded us we shall be dealing with that later <e> <s> the meaning of all this is contained in clause <e> <s> lord ross asked among other things about modifications <e> <s> the answer is that in clause the definition clause modifications is defined as including additions omissions and alterations <e> <s> the amendment provides that <e>", "<cs> yes and the noble lord referred to that <e> <s> i should have thought that if what i hope will become the will of parliament expressed by approval of the bill the royal assent to it and the true competition in the gas supply industry which the bill outlines comes to pass it must be sensible to build a pipe-line of the right capacity in the first place <e> <s> in other words the secretary of state must be able to know what is going on as indeed must anybody else so that the pipe-line does not have to be modified later on <e> <s> without the common carrier provisions i cannot see that there would be any competition in the gas supply industry <e>", "<cs> this has almost been a second reading debate on the general principles of the bill <e> <s> may i say straight away that the general principle on which this bill is based is that nobody knows and i am not prepared to damn anybody for this how efficient the gas corporation is unless competition is introduced into the gas industry <e>", "<cs> yes really <e> <s> i have been asked various questions on planning and various things <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher asked about the number of pipe-lines spanning the country from coast to coast from north to south and everywhere you can think of <e> <s> why does she think that we are going to enormous trouble in these clauses to make a common carrier provision <e>", "<cs> we are talking about additions to the bgc mains in the next clause we shall be discussing <e> <s> i accept that this is a very technical subject <e>", "<cs> we are talking about two different things <e> <s> i was talking about the costs which would give rise to rental charges <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross is talking about charges as i understand it for civil servants time <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i can tell him that applicants will not be charged for this <e> <s> this has received consideration naturally and we recognise that if such a charge were made it would firstly disadvantage the potential private supplier compared to the bgc and our objective is not to disadvantage anybody in this respect it is to treat the two sides in an even-handed manner <e> <s> as indeed was asked for by the front bench opposite on tuesday of last week <e>", "<cs> before this goes any further may i make two points on what the noble lord lord bishopston has just said <e> <s> first he said that the secretary of state will not have any time left to do anything else on energy <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what he has just said if the gas provisions and the direction-making powers go ahead as they are currently stated in the bill <e> <s> but has it not occurred to the noble lord that those arguments suggest that there is such an overflowing demand for private gas that there will be all these numerous applications and that therefore all these numerous decisions will have to be taken by the secretary of state <e> <s> i really cannot see the force of that argument <e>", "<cs> there was nothing incompatible if i may use the word between the two statements i made last week which the noble lord mentioned just now and the statement which i made earlier this afternoon <e> <s> let me start from the beginning <e> <s> i think that i said originally to the noble lord lord somers that where two supplies of gas go into the same pipe-line it is quite obvious that there can be no distinction when they come out of that pipe-line whether it is a private cubic foot of gas or whether it is a corporation cubic foot of gas <e>", "<cs> yes exactly <e> <s> in that case the private sector gas has to meet the specification of the bgc otherwise the bgc will be in clear breach of its own statutory duties and this will not be allowed to happen <e> <s> it may be that a private pipe-line is laid for the purpose of supplying a particular piece of machinery in a particular factory which will be allowed under the terms of the bill <e> <s> there is nothing to say that so long as both the pipe-line and the machinery are adapted to take the gas which is being supplied it should not be allowed <e> <s> this is why i say that one might have different purities for example or different calorific values of gas in different pipe-lines <e> <s> but where they are mixed in a bgc pipe-line the private gas has to meet the bgc specification <e> <s> i do not see any incompatibility between what i have just said and what i said on the earlier occasion <e>", "<cs> it is not so much a question of bgc gas <e> <s> the capacity will be used so i do not see that the noble baroness can laugh at this explanation <e>", "<cs> the pressure yes but not necessarily the amount of gas <e> <s> there is no question of the british gas corporation having to drop the pressure of its supplies if this would prejudice the conveyance of gas which the british gas corporation requires to perform its statutory duties and contractual obligations <e> <s> this is to be found in clause <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee should come to some decision upon this <e> <s> when the noble baroness lady phillips cross-questions me on the price of gas generally i really do think it is way outside the scope of the debate on this clause <e>", "<cs> on the other hand the noble lord lord wells-pestell asked me a very direct question on this clause <e> <s> he asked me what the price would be of each individual unit of gas coming out of the end of the pipe-line <e> <s> obviously both suppliers know what they put into the pipe-line because this will be metered <e> <s> bgc will charge its own price for the gas that it supplies and the private sector will charge its own price to the consumer for the gas that it supplies <e> <s> therefore there will be a true differential and we will know exactly who is competitive with whom <e>", "<cs> no certainly not <e> <s> the meters would be on the input end and not the output end of the pipe-line <e>", "<cs> not at this precise moment no <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness asks in essence a question concerning a point raised originally by the noble lord lord ross of marnock why interfere with the <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will accept that i am doing my best to answer questions put by noble lords but i accept the criticism made by my chief whip that is that this is taking a rather long time <e> <s> one of the questions asked of me by the noble lord lord beswick was will the government impose a gas levy on private suppliers as they have on the british gas corporation <e> <s> the answer to this is no <e> <s> the gas levy imposed on the british gas corporation reflects the fact that the british gas corporation receives substantial supplies of gas under contracts which have been in existence for some time <e> <s> the prices under these contracts were fixed prior to the oil price rises and the british gas corporation alone has the benefit of such contracts <e> <s> so a gas levy would be inappropriate in the case of the private sector <e>", "<cs> before i answer the substantive points of the noble lord lord ross he introduced his amendment by making a most astounding statement about statutory supplies and the ability of this bill to interfere with the corporations statutory supplies <e> <s> may i ask him to clear in my own mind exactly what he was talking about <e> <s> with which statutory supplies does the noble lord think the bill interferes <e> <s> in other words which statute are we talking about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seems to be modifying his tone <e> <s> he now says could originally he said did <e>", "<cs> he did <e> <s> we shall all be able to read it tomorrow and perhaps be able to settle this argument out of court as it were <e>", "<cs> clause says <e>", "<cs> yes my noble friend is absolutely correct on that point <e>", "<cs> because as i sought to explain it is already in the bill <e> <s> we prefer our wording to the wording in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the logic extends that far at all <e> <s> it is already in the bill <e> <s> therefore why alter it to change it <e> <s> but i would be perfectly prepared to accept the advice of my noble friend lord lauderdale to the extent that we shall carefully look at this again but i am totally unable to give any commitment on the outcome whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate that the intention of the noble lord lord ross of marnock in moving the amendment is that private gas transmitted through the corporations pipe-lines should be compatible with the corporations own gas <e> <s> a similar if not identical amendment was discussed for some time during the commons committee stage and i think that i can reassure the committee that the bill as at present drafted meets the concern of noble lords <e> <s> for private sector gas to be acceptable for transmission by one of the gas corporations own pipe-lines it is important that the gas should be of a type that the pipe-line is designed to convey otherwise the safety of the pipe-line system could be prejudiced and i accept that in extreme cases it would be prejudiced <e> <s> that point is already covered in clause which ensures that applications for a direction by the secretary of state to secure a right of conveyance for private gas through a corporation pipe-line must be in respect of gas that is of or is of a kind similar to the kind which the pipe-line is designed to convey <e>", "<cs> as i sought to explain the government have already considered the point because of the questions which were raised in another place and i have reported to the committee the results of the governments further deliberation <e> <s> i cannot go any further than that <e>", "<cs> the question of safety of the gas corporation line is related to the point raised in the last amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord has said <e> <s> however i would say that it is not a close connection it is a separate point <e> <s> it would help me and perhaps other members of the committee if we could direct our remarks on each amendment to that amendment <e> <s> this is meant as a mild criticism <e> <s> i will not push the point <e>", "<cs> i promised at the beginning of this afternoons proceedings that i would listen and have listened to the advice from all round the committee <e> <s> most certainly in this case i am prepared to be flexible <e> <s> we will certainly reconsider this amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will recognise the experience of my noble friend lord lauderdale <e> <s> he has put his finger squarely on the intentions of the clause <e> <s> clause provides that a person may apply to the secretary of state for directions securing to the applicant the right to use a pipe-line owned by the corporation and regulating the charges the corporation may levy for use of the line <e> <s> as i have stressed before the secretary of state may only give the corporation directions where he is satisfied that this will not prejudice the conveyance of gas required by the corporation or <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i misheard <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was talking about interruptible supplies <e> <s> this does not happen <e> <s> but interruptible supplies are part of the original contract between the consumer and the british gas corporation <e> <s> there would be a clause in the contract which stated upon what conditions the interruptibility would apply <e> <s> i cannot see that this should enter into the argument at all <e>", "<cs> we are here concerned with the national and regional gas consumers councils which were established by sections to of the gas act to consider the interests of gas consumers and represent those interests to the british gas corporation and where appropriate to the government <e> <s> i think few would doubt that the gas consumers councils have fulfilled a valuable function since their inception and i wish to pay tribute to the unstinting devotion to the consumers cause by successive chairmen and members of these councils including the work of the noble baroness lady macleod of borve who has been present throughout most of the committees discussions <e> <s> the very <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to this late hour and i was rather surprised to have this sprung on me <e> <s> nevertheless i make no complaint about it <e> <s> the effect of paragraph to which the noble lord draws attention is to refer to the element of clause which now defines relevant activities offshore and to enable the employment protection act to be applied by order in council in the foreign sectors of cross-boundary fields <e> <s> we are not making any more amendments than would give effect to that desire <e> <s> i hope that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords the house should be grateful to the noble lord lord kearton and the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment he appears to forget that we are now in the process of report stage <e> <s> i think i am correct in saying that the noble lord has spoken before to this amendment and so if he can phrase his remarks as questions i am sure that the house will he extremely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps this might be an appropriate hour to adjourn for dinner i suggest that we return at eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord ended his peroration with that particular phrase <e> <s> i had a horrible feeling he was asking me to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps after that intervention tempers may cool just slightly and i may be allowed to get on with my speech <e> <s> i was endeavouring to explain that although obviously the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the house agrees but it seems to me that this is an appropriate point at which to stop in order to allow tempers to revert to their customarily level course <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now adjourn <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick in moving this amendment described it as a very simple one <e> <s> in fact i think it is but the effects are not quite as simple as he would like us to believe <e> <s> he also said that this amendment is very similar to one rejected in committee <e> <s> what he did not say was that it was rejected on a division <e> <s> the argument then and now revolves around reimbursement for the british gas corporation of additional costs arising as a result of a direction and whether provision for reimbursement should be a permissive feature as the bill currently provides or mandatory as this amendment proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to answer what has been said <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware this clause makes such payments permissive and if it seems reasonable to the secretary of state they will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords before i reply in full to these amendments i should like to mention that we have not forgotten the discussion that we had in relation to two similar amendments at committee stage <e> <s> at the end of that discussion i promised to have another look at these amendments to see if they would add anything useful to the bill but made it clear that we could not promise any particular outcome <e> <s> since then we have carefully re-examined these suggestions but have reached the same conclusion that these amendments would serve no useful purpose <e> <s> moreover for reasons i shall explain shortly i think that the amendments suggested could jeopardise the purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i get the impression that i was being damned before i uttered <e> <s> perhaps could be allowed to utter and noble lords will then have the opportunity to damn me <e> <s> i recognise that this amendment reflects the governments repeated assurances which are firmly on the record that it is no part of our proposals that the gas corporation should run the common carrier service on anything other than a commercial basis <e> <s> while i have considerable sympathy with the noble lords reasons for moving this amendment i am bound to say that it is not desirable that such a provision should he written into the bill <e>", "<cs> gasps of horror my lords <e> <s> i knew they would come <e> <s> furthermore the objective of crystal clarity which the noble lord lord lovell-davis mentioned has resulted in stygian darkness <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i was about to answer points when the noble lord interrupted <e> <s> first i have been asked whether the gas corporation will disclose to all and sundry and to the secretary of state their method of working out tariffs based on the private sector <e> <s> i would hope so but they would not under the bill be obliged to <e> <s> if they do not however they can hardly blame the secretary of state if he comes down on the side of the applicant <e> <s> as far as the gas levy is concerned noble lords will remember that in committee--and i do not have the reference i said that the private supplier would not be bound by the gas levy <e> <s> the gas levy is applied solely to the corporations purchases of prt exempt gas under pre- contracts <e> <s> the corporation purchases a substantial proportion of its gas from untapped sources in the southern basin at prices which are very low in todays conditions and as a result was making large windfall profits <e>", "<cs> my lords that was going it a hit i felt <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether the british gas corporation prices would be more expensive due to the levy <e> <s> he knows full well that the gas which the gas corporation supplies to its consumers is from old existing fields in the north sea <e> <s> this means that all the existing discoveries of gas are contracted for to the bgc and therefore new supplies of gas will have to come from new discoveries and it will not make any difference whether the discoveries are sold to the gas corporation or to the private sector it will be the same gas <e>", "<cs> my lords i was also asked about the secretary of states adjudication role <e> <s> the effect of the existing sub-paragraph would require the secretary of state to adjudicate between the parties on the basis of sound commercial principles <e> <s> he could not depend on other factors such as government policy social or philanthropic principles or anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the answer is because it would not stand up in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords distortion of trade - is the actual eec wording and it seems that it has gone into parliamentary folklore <e> <s> when i used just now the phrase distortion of competition the noble lord pointed out that i used it twice it was in connection with straight distortion of competition between the british gas corporation on the one hand and potential private suppliers on the other <e> <s> there are no eec implications <e>", "<cs> on the specific and technical questions regarding rates which the noble lord lord bishopston asked i am afraid that at the moment i do not have the answers <e> <s> if i may be allowed to write to him because the questions are somewhat technical apart from anything else i shall make sure that i get my answers right <e> <s> i hope that covers the points which the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> i cannot envisage that there would not be consultations especially with my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for scotland <e> <s> if there are not to be consultations i shall let the noble lord know in the same letter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that certain countries in the region have suffered irregular rainfall and that crop prospects this year are poor <e> <s> we have responded either bilaterally or by supporting international action to appeals for assistance from mozambique zambia and zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware that this was the worst drought in that part of the world for years <e> <s> but would say that this area has irregular rainfall to say the least <e> <s> for example last year in most of the countries to which the noble lord has referred there were bumper crops especially in zimbabwe which still i understand has an export surplus <e> <s> so far as the food and agricultural organisation is concerned no it has not and indeed i do not know whether it will yet declared the region a disaster area but of course her majestys government are in full and constant touch with the fao on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding that my understanding is that there is still sufficient grain in zimbabwe to feed its people for the next year <e> <s> the problem as i am sure the noble baroness will be aware is transport <e> <s> the government have indeed given bilateral aid to zimbabwe for transport for the distribution of maize which i underline zimbabwe still has <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the international action includes support for the eec action which is principally the supply of dried skimmed milk powder and grain and also our contribution to the world food programme and the international emergency food reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem with irrigation is that it tends to be rather high cost <e> <s> i agree that there are low-cost forms for example surface irrigation but on the whole irrigation requires water pipes pumps and governments in developing countries are generally somewhat reluctant to commit funds to such schemes because the cost cannot be recouped from increased yields <e> <s> i agree however that it would indeed mitigate the effects of drought such as we are discussing at the moment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary <e> <s> i most certainly agree <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about shortage of water for cereal production cotton production and indeed for the feeding of animals <e> <s> there is as yet no problem with water consumption for humans <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly do that though i would point out that very expensive storage facilities are not necessarily appropriate to the areas of the world we are currently discussing <e> <s> for example as the noble lord knows the traditional method of storage of maize is in bags and governments in that part of the world are extremely reluctant to get away from that because the capital expense does not justify the return <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not our practice nor has it been that of previous governments to keep records of ethnic minorities within the diplomatic service <e> <s> there are women currently working <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the noble lords supplementary questions in order i would say first that i think that the house will accept that diplomats must be seen to represent britain and because of that fact in some countries neither women nor the ethnic minorities would be acceptable as ambassadors or high commissioners the moslem world for example readily springs to mind <e> <s> with regard to women in senior positions in the diplomatic service to the best of my knowledge there are no women high commissioners and currently there are three women ambassadors in post in oslo copenhagen and montevideo <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe in integration of all sorts and i would not accept that the scottish nation is an ethnic minority <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i quite agree <e> <s> i do not approve of statutory women in any activity <e>", "<cs> my lords recently the position in the diplomatic service has changed and there is now no restriction at all on married women <e> <s> so i would say no her prospects are not now affected <e>", "<cs> my lords it would include any member of society who is of a creed and a racial origin different from that of the general population <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord took my point <e> <s> perhaps i may give him a further illustration in that it would not at any rate in my view be appropriate to have a senior diplomat of the jewish faith in a moslem country or indeed perhaps vice versa in israel a diplomat of the moslem faith whether the diplomat be a man or woman and that i would include as i told my noble friend among the ethnic minorities <e> <s> further to that i can say with authority that there is absolutely no discrimination of any kind within the diplomatic service <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we have much appreciated the strong support given by the overwhelming majority of commonwealth governments and the secretary-general throughout the falklands crisis <e> <s> mr ramphal has offered help in any way possible and we remain in close touch with him <e> <s> however the important responsibility for defence and for the restoration of normal conditions must be primarily our own though we shall naturally be very willing to consider any further offers of support from our commonwealth partners <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly willing for other friendly governments to be associated in some way with the security arrangements for the falkland islands <e> <s> if my noble friend has some particular arrangement in mind we shall of course be <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is trying to draw parallels where none exist <e> <s> the two institutions are completely different <e> <s> for one thing the open university is paid for as i am sure she knows by a direct grant from the department of education and science whereas the grant for birk-beck being part of the university of london is paid for by the university grants committee <e> <s> further than that the point about birkbeck is that the colleges charter allows it to admit different kinds of students but specifically and principally persons engaged in earning their livelihood during the day so as i have said no parallels exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the government obviously accept the view put forward by the noble <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will certainly bring that to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i accept that my lords but the problem is that in order to take account of this particular situation it would be necessary to change the colleges charter <e>", "<cs> my lords i will also put that point to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking on behalf of the government on this occasion we are extremely grateful for those few words from the noble lord lord mishcon in my previous employment the letters ddt stood for something rather different from their meaning in my mind now ddt now <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of a -hour clock i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> this seems an appropriate moment for your lordships to move on to other business but before moving that the house be resumed i should tell your lordships that it has been agreed through the usual channels that we shall not be continuing with our current business the employment bill until <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> none my lords <e> <s> following the release on th july yesterday of flight lieutenant glover there are no british servicemen being held by argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have noted this and other statements but do not consider that at this stage a united kingdom request to the united nations security council would be fruitful <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the taped interview with mr arafat reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of her majestys government as expressed in the venice declaration which we all know was that there should be recognition of each other by both sides <e> <s> this has not changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the negotiations if such they are are of course secret and it would be dangerous to expose any particular lines of such negotiations in advance of their being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will know this government believe in open government <e> <s> however the situation is as i described it in my answer to the last supplementary question should it be appropriate to reveal the details of discussions with my right honourable friend at the foreign office in downing street or anywhere else i shall make certain that that is done and the house will be informed <e>", "<cs> again my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it springs to mind that the situation in the middle east dates back at least to and i do not think it will be cleared up overnight <e>", "<cs> i was not aware of it my lords but i shall certainly look into the point <e>", "<cs> my lords since taking up my appointment i have said to the noble lord lord brockway from this dispatch box on at least one occasion that i have learnt considerably from the questions he has posed to her majestys government and i am well aware of his desire to be constructive in this as in all other matters <e> <s> as to a united nations security council meeting today the answer is yes but i do not know whether it would be appropriate for such discussions to take place at that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i always try to be helpful and i must say on this occasion that i really do not know the answer to the question <e> <s> i shall do my best to ascertain it and if i may write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon i did not quite get the drift of the question <e> <s> of course i share the general hope <e> <s> but it is a fact that the palestinian liberation organisations leaders are somewhat amorphous no perhaps that is the wrong word distinct would be a better word and they do not always put forward the same views <e>", "<cs> my lords the office of the united nations disaster relief co-ordinator is the focal point for international disaster relief co-ordination <e> <s> in addition to our direct humanitarian help the government are working closely with this organisation as are many other governments the european community and the relief agencies to relieve the suffering of the lebanese people <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that supplementary my lords <e> <s> nearly million in unilateral aid has been given in the lebanese situation and we are contributing about million to the <e>", "<cs> both my lords <e> <s> the initial response by the government was for which was a cash grant to the lebanon red cross which was telegraphed on th june only six days after the incident to our embassy there <e> <s> the rest has been paying for such things as blankets and tents and air freight for other peoples blankets <e>", "<cs> although that is rather a different question my lords i would say that until the situation becomes clearer and the constant military action de-escalates it will be impossible for the government to come to a decision on the matter <e>", "<cs> not in answer to this question my lords <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a question on the subject i should of course be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> indeed i am able to say my lords <e> <s> there has previously been some reference in the house to the problems of the access of the international red cross to the area <e> <s> i am glad to say that those have now been resolved and that there are now teams on the ground in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> yes my lords without the faintest shadow of doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom representatives at the world bank supported an million dollar loan in for a study of possible hydro-electric schemes in the region <e> <s> this is currently taking place and is expected to be completed by the end of october this year <e> <s> no other proposals have come before the banks board <e> <s> any proposals arising from the study will be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see absolutely no parallel between the falklands situation and the venezuelan-guyanan situation <e> <s> the venezuelan government have made it clear both in public statements and to british ministers that they intend to follow the provisions of the geneva agreement in order to reach a peaceful settlement of the controversy <e> <s> since the argentine invasion of the falklands there has been no evidence that the venezuelan government have changed their resolve to settle the dispute by peaceful negotiation <e> <s> with regard to the reference made by the noble lord lord northfield to a war of nerves i should like to say that the venezuelan government and the venezuelan representative at the world bank have absolutely no power to veto <e> <s> the decision is taken by a majority of the banks directors <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble baronesss supplementary question yes i would agree most certainly that the guyanan government and of course the secretary-general of the commonwealth mr ramphal who is guyanan were among the first to give their support to us in our endeavour over the falklands <e> <s> regarding the second part of the supplementary question we shall of course have to await the results of the study <e> <s> so may i say to the noble baroness that her question is first hypothetical and secondly a little premature <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not precisely sure as to that but i can say that there is no garrison in guyana <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord lord northfield when he talks about a war of nerves <e> <s> this was a political act and it has failed to come off <e>", "<cs> my lords aid is never specifically tied to human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that that is another question <e> <s> i am not prepared at this time to get into arguments about the state of oil fields in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords as the conclusions are rather long i have placed a copy in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> the council examined in turn the pursuit of national food policies and strategies in developing countries direct national and international measures to help eradicate hunger the african food problem and the role of international agencies and issues of world food security and trade <e> <s> britain is not this year a member of the council but our representative was present as an observer and took part in formulating the common community position both for general debate and for the preparation of the conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am satisfied with the conclusions of the conference mentioned in the noble lords question <e> <s> however i would point out that the object of the conference which was set up in following the world food conference was to provide a political forum where agriculture ministers could and should meet annually to review the world food situation <e> <s> both of the points to which the noble lord has drawn attention find expression in the communiqu concerning the conclusions and recommendations to which the question refers <e> <s> i most certainly agree with the noble lord that these are the two most serious problems facing the world today <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be a fact but i do not think it is the reason here <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords i accept that there is currently a snarl-up in world interest rates but i think that the most important thing is to give sufficient aid and instruction to enable the countries to grow their own food <e> <s> this is probably the key to the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the governments and countries concerned <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly the government attach great importance to our multilateral forms of aid whether they be of grain or anything else through our membership of the economic community <e> <s> regarding the special grain reserves to which the noble lord referred in the first part of his supplementary question i would say that this idea was noted with appreciation but many questions were then raised and have since been raised about its economic and technical feasibility <e> <s> the conclusions of the conference asked the director to do more work on it with other agencies concerned and to bear in mind the related questions involved <e> <s> in fact it was agreed that there was a case for building up grain reserves in developing countries as part of their own stocks and production policies as well as for protection against market fluctuations <e> <s> the united kingdom governments view is that another thing which should go hand in hand with this is the solving of transport difficulties which tend to preclude regional stores <e>", "<cs> my lords i must note with some measure of approval what the noble lord lord brockway has said and point out that the world food council was set up to serve as a co-ordinating mechanism to provide overall integrated and continuing attention for the successful co-ordination and follow-up of policies concerning food production <e>", "<cs> my lords many of these countries about which we are talking this afternoon have enormous potential but without help they are unable to realise this potential <e> <s> that i think probably answers the noble lords question

co-operation funds and under unesco fao and united nations education and training programme for southern africa arrangements <e> <s> we will continue to keep our programmes of educational and training assistance for namibians under careful review <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the world university services paper on the subject where they complained that her majestys government are at present contributing only a quarter of a million pounds a year to the education and training of namibians <e> <s> only is a word which i would have left out of that paper <e> <s> to me it is a considerable sum of money <e> <s> i know that the house is particularly concerned about the cost of training and how training is arrived at for commonwealth students and prospective commonwealth students in this country <e> <s> i would say that all namibian students are here on scholarships which are directly funded from the british aid programme or that of international agencies <e> <s> the noble lord is correct in that english has been selected as the official language after independence <e> <s> it is for this reason that we are putting great emphasis on a primary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about that <e> <s> to the best of my belief there is one in windhoek <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already explained that the charging of full costs fees does not affect the namibians because they are already under scholarship arrangements <e> <s> nor will it affect future namibian students unless they come privately to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first supplementary question is concerned the british government contribute multilaterally to the united nations for educational purposes and it is the united nations which to a great extent fund their own organisation which is the so-called union the united nations institute for namibia and which as the noble lord knows is centred at lusaka <e> <s> as to how the students and the scholarships are organised i can say that we are ready to consider and do consider applications for training awards from namibians nominated by organisations inside and outside namibia which would include union <e> <s> however we do not acknowledge the status of the institutions set up within namibia as part of the internal settlement resulting from the elections in december <e> <s> we grant awards on the basis of educational and developmental criteria and regardless of applicants political affiliation <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not mean that <e> <s> all i said was that the students currently in this country come under scholarship arrangements therefore the arguments on charging or not charging for university and technical education in this country do not apply <e>", "<cs> that might be the case but as i have indicated all this is conditional upon namibia reaching full independence <e>", "<cs> my lords although that is a somewhat different question we are discussing the namibians in this question i would say that the sole responsibility for a peaceful democratic world is not on the shoulders of the united kingdom government <e> <s> secondly the government are absolutely right in expecting students of those countries who are able to be educated in this country under non-subsidised arrangements to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not consider it inopportune for me to congratulate you upon the speed succinctness and lucidity that you have displayed in regard to the complicated subject which has just been debated <e> <s> having said that i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until <e>", "<cs> this seems to be an appropriate moment after <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the

exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord george-brown has picked up my point on authoritative statements and with his experience i had no doubt that he would <e> <s> i should like to make a remark which in fact i should have made to the noble lord lord brockway but i regret that in my answer to his list of questions i omitted this one <e> <s> we have of course long pressed

the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in total agreement with the views just expressed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has very much more experience in these matters than i

prime minister in another place on th july we reserve the right to claim compensation from argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords we were wronged by the argentines in their aggression and would certainly be entitled to claim compensation as my noble friend says <e> <s> however there would be formidable practical difficulties in our securing payment <e> <s> our objective throughout the conflict was to restore the rights of the islanders <e> <s> while we reserve the right to claim compensation we do not believe that it would serve any useful purpose at this stage to put in such a claim <e>", "<cs> we seem to have got beyond that point my lords because there are no argentine forces on the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that is a little wide of this question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of the point which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords there is absolutely no question of our behaving as though we had been defeated <e> <s> what matters in all this is the rights and future lives of the islanders <e> <s> whatever we do and whatever policies we pursue we will put them in the forefront of our minds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elystan-morgan misunderstood me <e> <s> i certainly did not say a claim was in the process of being consulted upon in london or anywhere else and i am not prepared to speculate on when and whether such a claim may

forces <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble lords second supplementary question these views are still under discussion and i am not yet in a position to give the noble lord the information he wants <e> <s> as far as the soviet peace committee is concerned i agree with the noble lord that it is a loose organ of the state but i cannot draw from that the same conclusions that he does because there are other peace movements which are under what i can only describe as subjection in the soviet union at the moment <e> <s> for example the noble lord will know well the case of mr sakharov whose dissenting views are certainly not tolerated <e> <s> there is also the fact mentioned by the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich in his letter to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly that is the intention of her majestys government and further we are absolutely determined to seek an agreement on the very difficult problem of verification which will still take a long time to clear up i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a lot of sympathy with that view because i noticed that in mr gromykos recent speech to the united nations he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the noble lords involvement in all this although of course i did know that he was a member of the delegation to the soviet peace committee <e> <s> however i accept that there is good reason for looking at

moment but certainly the current multilateral negotiations going on between the eec both as a collective organisation and as individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a little thrown by the noble lord lord jenkins supplementary question in that i would have thought it was an argument against proposals coming from the peace committee rather than for them <e>", "<cs> my lords to make the world a more peaceful place is quite definitely the objective of us all wherever we sit and wherever we may reside <e> <s> however the information imparted to the house by the noble lord lord brockway on his

purpose of such a scheme would be transhipment of norwegian gas to european markets it is clear that norwegian participation is essential before the idea can be pursued <e> <s> on a number of recent occasions we have indicated to the norwegian government that her majestys government would be willing to consider any specific proposals for such a pipeline <e> <s> so far it is true no such proposals have come forward but we shall he ready to examine them positively if and when they do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the parties concerned to resolve any differences <e> <s> in the start talks this

how could i possibly forget that the noble lord lord brockway went to moscow recently on a peace mission <e> <s> all proposals for neutralising blockages should be examined carefully and on their merits but i am afraid i am bound to say that i see this as a well-intentioned idea but a non-starter <e> <s> it is very difficult to see how a group could be assembled which was both genuinely independent and sufficiently experienced to resolve an inevitably complex matter <e> <s> furthermore it is difficult to see that the eastern <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think these things are irrelevant at all <e> <s> what i would say however is that the more the numbers of conventional forces are in balance the less likelihood and the less need there would be for nuclear forces <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think i misunderstood the supplementary question put by the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> what i was saying is that this is not the right way to go about resolving the difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure but i note that cuba is currently at the head of the non-aligned nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have caused confusion to the man in the street or indeed to noble lords it certainly was not my intention so to do <e> <s> there are of course three main negotiations going on one is the start talks which are about nuclear forces another is the mbfr talks which are specifically about non-nuclear forces and the third is the inf so-called which is a nato allies nuclear talk <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the united kindom could be possibly involved in this discussion - this committee of experts - simply because by the very nature of our geographical position and our nuclear forces we are an involved party <e> <s> i apologise for using the expression non-starter which may or may not he a parliamentary expression but none the less it is a symptom of what i feel in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble and learned lord but the great problem is to find these experts who are non-aligned <e> <s> if they could be agreed by both sides as being non-aligned experts we would be a great

<e>", "<cs> the report does <e> <s> as regards the notice given the report fails to distinguish between the awareness that the settlement was to close and notice of the exact date of arrival of the vessel that was to transport the settlers <e> <s> the mauritius government drew up a resettlement plan for the ilois <e> <s> this was costed at and in her majestys government paid this sum to the mauritius government <e> <s> they did not quibble about the figure or try to beat it down <e> <s> in the mauritius prime minister acknowledged its receipt in full and final settlement of any claim upon us by the mauritius government in respect of resettlement <e> <s> but the ilois themselves found the plan unattractive <e> <s> by agreement with the mauritius government we provided specialist advice in an attempt to break the impass and i should add in passing that this advice provided by mr russell prosser was not kept secret as the minority rights group report asserts <e> <s> but the mauritius government were unable to secure the agreement of the ilois to the resettlement programme <e> <s> eventually in they decided to distribute the grant plus interest in cash in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the ilois <e>", "<cs> my lords the next statement is not yet cleared from another place <e> <s> and so perhaps the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington would be good enough to speak on the second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state

might have made reference to an element of crowing but of course we will not do that sort of thing will we <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think it is a wise procedure to butter toasts on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the yo-yo of industrial politics in this respect is not good for anybody but if the other side did not have such an idealistic approach to all these matters there would be no need for it <e> <s> the noble lord also asked where the proceeds are going <e> <s> as with all other privatisation exercises they will go into general treasury funds and the government will make such use of them as they see fit at a particular time to meet a particular contingency <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government do not agree with the main thrust of the noble lords argument <e> <s> his reading of the papers over the weekend must have been a tiny bit selective because if you include monday i managed to obtain a

must tell your lordships that i rather resent the remark of the noble baroness lady gaitskell who called my colleagues amateurs <e> <s> the secretary of state was a leading financial journalist and one of his junior ministers was a leading merchant banker <e> <s> i could not agree less with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did hear me correctly <e> <s> i said that the money would go to the treasury <e> <s> that was a slight euphemism because the money goes of course into the national exchequer <e> <s> as far as i know but if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord there has been no commitment to spend this money in any particular direction <e> <s> the other question which the noble lord asked me was about the total cost was it not <e>", "<cs> my lords the free shares were held up so in effect there is no cost <e> <s> i do not understand the point which the noble lord is making <e>", "<cs> those shares my lords will of course have a value but they will not have a cost <e> <s> that is the distinction <e> <s> i have no idea what will be the value of britoil shares on the london stock exchange in three years time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord

measures which i have described is quite impossible to quantify nor is it possible to put on them a figure of million as did my noble friend as to a great extent they depend on the uptake by the energy concerns <e> <s> however energy costs are a significant proportion of many industries costs and their reduction can only help to make them more competitive-something that we would all wish to see <e>", "<cs> my lords help over energy prices is always considered by all governments on its merits and is given to particular industries at particular times when the need arises <e> <s> so fas as electricity is concerned as i said in my original answer special electricity load management arrangements are designed to help large users who in return can offer the electricity supply industry some control of their electricity demands <e> <s> over of the largest electricity consumers are able to benefit from the latest load management arrangements which can produce price reductions of up to per cent <e> <s> the noble lord must surely agree that this is a great help <e>", "<cs> my lords large consumers of coal are generally speaking under long-term contractual arrangements so it is not always the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether it applies to the steel industry directly but certainly as a large user of electricity it would apply to them <e> <s> however the specific measure

up-to-date news on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any special provision over and above the measures that i have outlined relating to those two industries <e> <s> however my original

absolutely true <e> <s> as i said we have changed the emphasis to making sure that such services as there are should be heard in as many places as possible rather than concentrate as our predecessors did on having as many languages as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the second part of the noble lords supplementary question does i suggest go slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s>

development policy <e> <s> we supported those ideas aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of community aid but expressed reservations about certain ideas principally those which implied a substantial shift in the balance of aid expenditure from bilateral aid to the community aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord oram is referring to a small article which appeared a few days ago in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unfortunately not the case that the various surpluses to which the noble lord referred are the most cost effective way of giving food aid <e> <s>

effect by spending money upon buying food from one neighbouring country in order to supply another which is actually in need <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it would be discussed well into the new

my lords i made the point earlier that the old vulcanised india rubber wiring is absolutely safe provided it is not disturbed <e> <s> i recommend the noble lord not to disturb his wiring <e> <s> having remade that point the noble lord is course quite correct and the sensible thing to do is to consult the area electricity board <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some experience of direct mail advertising and while it is a very good method of bringing services to the attention of the public in this case a consumer of a nationalised industry it is not necessarily very effective <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i ask whether he meant my noble friend lord trefgarne or my noble friend lord mansfield <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to use an unparliamentary expression wow <e> <s> some months ago i let it be known selectively that i regarded a debate on the fast reactor long overdue <e> <s> it is appropriate therefore that i should be the person responsible for giving the governments reply to this spectacular debate <e> <s> i am not a ducker of debates but when and on what subject is of course a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> noble lords have referred to a possible future statement i am unable to make any <e>", "<cs> ah my lords that is rather different <e> <s> had i been asked that question i might have given a different answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i was certainly here for the introduction of the noble viscounts remarks <e> <s> what he said was that the country had had little commercially from nuclear power <e> <s> those were his words <e> <s> we may or may not disagree on the subject <e> <s> perhaps we can both apologise to each other if appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i was even more dense when listening to the noble viscount than i expected <e> <s> perhaps when we have both read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure but i believe there is one on stream going to india in the near future so all is not yet lost <e> <s> the noble duke the duke of portland with his vast experience of the european nuclear scene referred especially to collaboration with a view to saving the public exchequer <e> <s> the more we <e>", "<cs> no my lords i will not retract or reconsider the statement i have just made <e> <s> what i said was on nuclear waste not production there are no technical reasons to prevent safety from being achieved and i stick by that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to i shall come back to that but i shall try to answer the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i agree that it should be on the record <e> <s> the noble lord lord energlyn took us on if i may so call it a slight flight of scientific fancy into the future <e> <s> the commercial fusion power is a much longer-term prospect than the fast reactor <e> <s> the government fully recognise that fusion is a potential energy source of great importance <e> <s> however the costs and time-scales involved in developing a commercial reactor are enormous <e> <s> therefore the best way to proceed is on the basis of the widest possible international collaboration <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi mentioned culham and this is of course exactly what i am talking about <e> <s> this has the twin merits of pooling resources and the wide dissemination of research results <e> <s> the other scientific suggestions for producing electricity in the future that the noble lord mentioned may well come about but i should stress in the future <e> <s> they are inevitably even further off than fusion power <e>", "<cs> my lords the conference resumed on th november <e> <s> together with our partners and allies we have drawn attention to violations of the helsinki final act particularly by the soviet union and poland and have stressed the need for a balanced and substantive concluding document covering all areas of the final act <e> <s> to this end we have jointly put forward amendments to the draft concluding document tabled by the neutral and non-aligned countries <e>", "<cs> my lords we have continually pressed the soviet union and its allies on human rights and <e> <s> of course csce is concerned largely but not exclusively with that subject <e> <s> i would agree with my noble friend that there are considerably greater human rights in the western part of europe than in the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say that that was exactly the point of a conference such as is currently being held in madrid <e> <s> talks cannot be anything but good <e> <s> the question is whether what the noble lord called unofficial talks will have the desired effect and will effectively do better than the official talks <e> <s> i rather doubt it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an undeniable human right in this country and i think i am right in saying in the whole of western europe that people should be allowed to make their views known with all the force at their command <e> <s> it is possible of course to go off at a slight tangent <e> <s> so i would agree with my noble friend at least as far as he goes that one should think very carefully before demonstrating or whatever for or against a particular point of view <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot answer the noble lords specific point but i shall of course take the opportunity to write to him <e> <s> as regards the amendments which are still required to the draft final document there are in fact five of them four of which concern human rights <e> <s> amendments are required first on human contacts secondly on experts meeting on human rights in the future thirdly on the position of trade unions and fourthly on official monitoring groups for the helsinki final act <e> <s> last but by no means least there is a conference on disarmament proposed in the draft final act and one of our objectives is to seek a real mandate for this and also agreement on the zone of its application <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord broekway that without the non-aligned nations the current draft document would not be on the table and the government are extremely grateful to them for that <e> <s> however it is also true to say that both sides need an amplification of it and want to make changes to it <e> <s> i am afraid i have lost the other point that the noble lord raised <e> <s> perhaps he would care to repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords the possibility is always there <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the experience to which my noble friend refers i was not in her place at the time <e> <s> however i should think that on balance she is probably right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question and i am grateful to the noble lord lord broekway for repeating his own we very much take the point that it should be there but with the provisos that i mentioned earlier namely that there must be a real mandate and there must be agreement on the zone of application before it can become effective <e>", "<cs> my lords quite certainly i agree with the noble lord that this request by the lebanese government shows great confidence in the abilities that we have in this country to perform such a role <e> <s> my admiration for my noble friends work in the field of foreign affairs is second to none and i am very happy to be joined in this by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords to a certain extent i would agree with my noble friend <e> <s> one thing that is always of vital importance in foreign affairs is that one must be seen to be and one must actually be even-handed in every respect <e> <s> i agree that this applies to the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is exactly what the multinational force is designed to achieve <e>", "<cs> no my lords i could not disagree with the noble lord more <e> <s> i believe that my noble friends unique ability in the field of foreign affairs was to get on with both sides while understanding the position of the minorities <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> again this is exactly the reason for the multinational force which of course is to fill the vacuum and to aid the lebanese army in their general policing role within that very troubled country <e> <s> i am afraid to say that it will remain troubled for some considerable time to come <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the matters to which i referred earlier as being urgently considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather doubt in this day and age that that were possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree that there are grounds for very gentle optimism but a lot of water has to flow under the bridge before we see a settled lebanon again <e>", "<cs> my lords the area of reductions has been agreed that all participants with forces stationed there will share in the reductions and that the first reductions should be made by united states and soviet forces with reductions in the latter being greater <e> <s> it has also been agreed that the end result should be for each sides combined ground and air forces in the area to be limited to around up to of whom could be ground forces <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two obstacles <e> <s> first there is not yet base data agreement by which i mean that the eastern side dispute the wests figures for the eastern forces <e> <s> secondly as i have told the house many times before there is no agreement on effective verification measures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and the house will well know that the mbfr talks have nothing whatever to do with nuclear weapons <e> <s> however there is no doubt in my mind at least that one of the objects of the soviet government and their allies is to confuse the strategy of the opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords the allies are constantly reviewing the size shape and concept of their operations and equipment including anti-tank weapons and their forces and have not been inhibited in so doing by the existence of these negotiations <e> <s> that does not in any way detract from the need to seek to preserve security at lower and equal force levels <e> <s> that is the approach which the alliance is supporting in all the current negotiations including these talks to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> he is of course absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> as i have said already my lords a nuclear test ban treaty is rather wide of the question <e> <s> on the substantive point raised by the noble lord after long negotiations such as these it is often forgotten why they originated in the first place <e> <s> the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think talking about avoiding war should be considered in terms of cost it is vital to all our lives <e> <s> while the noble lord lord shinwell has much more experience of government that i have i do not recommend the strategy when in doubt change the team <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is precisely what the eastern <e>", "<cs> on the principle that that was a question my lords this is the answer <e> <s> one of natures most effective beasts of prey is the spider yet it spends per cent <e> <s> of its life sitting absolutely still <e> <s> in this as in so many other cases i believe in following the example of the true professional <e>", "<cs> alas <e> <s> my lords i am informed that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> we now know after the speeches we have just listened to that we have been allotted only this dinner hour a maximum of one hour to discuss the bill and another piece of business and that by agreement through the usual channels we are to get this bill through all its stages in that time <e> <s> i hope i can rely on the co-operation of noble lords to achieve this worthy objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the business of the house is precluding us from discussing the affairs of the commonwealth development corporation more fully <e> <s> however without offering a debate on the subject it is possible that the house may decide to debate the whole subject of overseas aid of which the corporation as has been said is an important and successful part and in my view to <e>", "<cs> my lords i take that point as does my chief whip but i still think that the time given to speeches does not necessarily reflect either the time spent on generating those speeches or the importance of a particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords in no way did i think or i hope suggest that the noble lord was critical <e> <s> i thought he was eliciting information which i was glad to give and i hope he will accept my reply in that light <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> my information is that the rise in cash to provide for example million in represents an increase in the commonwealth development corporations share of the aid programme <e> <s> i anticipate that the noble lord will not be very happy with that answer and if i may i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords with my renewed thanks to the house i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> on that happy note of amity perhaps i may now move that we break for the dinner recess and resume the house <e> <s> the committee stage of the national heritage bill will not be resumed until five minutes past eight at the earliest <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real pleasure for me to have been asked to reply to this unstarred question from the noble lord lord oram on behalf of the government not only because i enjoy listening to and sometimes profiting from his wide experience of overseas aid matters but also because for once in my political life i am able to address the house upon a subject about which i know a little from first-hand experience <e> <s> so that speaking for the government i welcome this opportunity to make absolutely clear that the government appreciate as much as i do personally the contribution that the societies which are members of the british volunteer aid programme have made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should contain his soul in patience just a little longer <e> <s> he made the point very concisely not quite as concisely as now in his original speech and there really was not any need for him to repeat it <e>", "<cs> when the time comes i will answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i have been trying to make is that no project has come to an end through these cuts <e> <s> the fact that they are operated differently and that some have gone up and some down is i contend very much a matter for the organisations themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will realise that this is a fast-moving situation <e> <s> following <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid it was impossible to catch all the points made in the supplementary question put by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> however i can agree with him on his second point <e> <s> so far as his first point is concerned in which he accused me of making an ambiguous statement i suggest that the statement means exactly what is says <e> <s> we are dealing with the moroccan government on this matter and it is for them to decide when the time is right to make an announcement <e>", "<cs> my lords on several occasions we have explained the kind of step which would make such a meeting possible a clear statement from the plo accepting israels right to exist if necessary on condition that israel accepted legitimate palestinian rights and confirming that they had renounced terrorism <e> <s> i stick by that <e>", "<cs> my lords the delegation about which we are talking is a collective arab delegation of the arab league <e> <s> nobody in this country has ever said and i do not believe it has ever been suggested before the noble lords supplementary question that the plo should be a member of such a delegation <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with my noble friend my lords but i will add to his comment that it is absolutely essential that this voice is not accompanied by threats of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because the king of morocco is to lead the delegation and it is for him to say who are to be members of the delegation or otherwise <e>", "<cs> the plo may have won its position by assassination my lords but we are all concerned to make very clear that it will not keep it by that method <e> <s> further than that this question is not about the plo but about the delegation i have described <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of the facts behind the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> i do not believe that it is a one-sided position we have bent over backwards to be eminently fair and eminently reasonable to all the parties to this dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord hankey and this is exactly what we have been trying to do since before this question was put down in december <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is an indication but i do not believe that it is an acceptable indication to any other party until one of the leaders of the plo makes this assertion in public <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully expect a very early announcement on the delegation to this country from the arab league which will include visits to her majesty the queen the prime minister and the foreign office <e> <s> further to that i believe that all of us in this area should work to fulfil the prophecy in isaiah that the wolf shall dwell with the lamb <e>", "<cs> my lords the six-monthly returns for the end of december are currently being analysed but at the count on st july last local authorities owned acres nearly two-thirds of the total of all publicly owned land on the registers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may correct my noble friend on one point not all of this land is in the remit of the councils <e> <s> quite a lot of other public land is included <e> <s> so far as directions are concerned my right honourable friend is actively considering this matter in respect of a number of sites on the registers <e> <s> the procedure would be to invite the owning public body to state whether there is any reason why a <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the last point is concerned <e> <s> i should have thought that the land in question there would be privately owned <e> <s> i agree however that there are advance sites factory sites for which local councils and others would have the responsibility <e> <s> so far as the capital allocation and so on goes with the rate support grant or the gre as i understand it is now called my understanding is that there is a capital underspend by councils <e> <s> i do not believe therefore that this can be a reason <e> <s> however i agree with the noble baroness that there may be good reasons why some sites should be retained and put to use in the public sector <e> <s> naturally the secretary of state cannot properly make directions without considering the merits of each case <e>", "<cs> my lords as a general tenet i should think that if they are able to use that land they should use it <e> <s> if not they should allow somebody else to make use of it <e> <s> however as i have already said my right honourable friend cannot do anything without considering each case on its merits <e> <s> if the noble baroness has in mind any particular area of land to which she would like to draw my attention naturally <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is an invitation i shall be most grateful to accept it <e> <s> however i would point out that this has not happened during the lifetime of this government only <e> <s> some of these sites have been derelict for very many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the information requested is not readily available <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord misunderstood my answer <e> <s> the present clerical statistics system is designed to show the overall performance of the planning appeals system <e> <s> statistics are published quarterly and annually which indicate the number of decisions issued both by inspectors and the secretary of state with the median processing times for the four categories of appeal that is transferred inquiry and written representations cases and secretary of state inquiry and written representations cases and the success rate for each category of appeal <e> <s> we now have a computer-based statistical system being developed which will provide such <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not in all cases an appropriate way of discovering the facts which the noble lord wishes to press me on which is one of the reasons why the computer-based system will be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be an appropriate moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i think it has been agreed through the usual channels that the house will not reassemble until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the government regard this as a serious and unwarranted charge <e> <s> had i been inaccurate in my answers i would have followed the time-honoured precedent of making a personal statement to the house <e> <s> in short my lords the answer to the noble lords question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords on st december last i understood that the noble lords original question was fuelled by a report by one of the members of another place who had visited the falklands late last summer under the auspices of the ministry of defence claiming that a large number of british maps of the falklands were left behind by the argentines <e> <s> the maps referred to by the member in question have since been identified <e> <s> it is a small map of the kind used to illustrate booklets i hope the noble lord lord shackleton who i see sitting on the front bench opposite will excuse me when i tell him and the house that the map in question is bound into his report which i obtained from the library this morning or alternatively which tourists might purchase as a souvenir <e> <s> two thousand copies of it were sent to the falkland islands government secretariat in june <e> <s> it is possible that the argentines found some there after the invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that this was a most unfortunate incident from which neither i nor i do not think anybody else on st december can claim any credit whatsoever <e> <s> but on mature reflection and the noble lord lord jenkins has given me plenty of time nearly two months for mature reflection i think that the worst charge i can face is that my answers on that occasion were unclear <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i still do not think that we are talking about admiralty charts <e> <s> we are talking about the land-based maps which were published as the noble lord lord shackleton said and as i said originally by the directorate of overseas surveys and were printed by the ordnance survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand but i am subject to correction on this that the maps are available only in england and in the falkland islands <e> <s> i do not think they are available anywhere in the world <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i said that as far as i knew they were on sale only in this country and in the falkland islands <e> <s> whether as i suspect my noble friend was suggesting they could be bought in france or anywhere else as i say i doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords the normal course of events if a noble lord is unsatisfied with an answer he gets from the government is to approach the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords at st january the registers contained details of sites of one acre or more amounting to acres of unused and under-used land owned by public bodies <e> <s> by the same date some acres of registered land had been disposed of or brought into use <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> it is estimated from a special study that about per cent <e> <s> of the land on the first registered appeared to be suitable for housing development <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that housebuilding depends on demand <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble lord would have his own views on that subject <e> <s> the housebuilding federation also conducted a study and found that per cent <e> <s> of the land on a sample of registers was both suitable for housing and and this is the differential is available to private builders <e> <s> there is no conflict there with my departments estimate <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot say how long this land would last at the current rate of housebuilding <e> <s> if i may <e> <s> i shall take the opportunity to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have details on that <e> <s> however i would point out as i pointed out when i was answering a similar question on th january <e> <s> that we are not entirely talking about local authorities <e> <s> although the counties and districts between them make up acres that is per cent <e> <s> of the total nationalised industries and statutory undertakers have declared acres government departments and other crown bodies and other public bodies such as new towns housing corporations and so on a further acres <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> no one should run away with the idea that local authorities are entirely to blame in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the land falls as i understand it into three categories <e> <s> i have already identified the per cent <e> <s> which is thought to be suitable for housebuilding <e> <s> there is a small amount of agricultural land and i would assume that the rest is suitable for factory sites and roads car parks or perhaps extensions to stations and such things <e>", "<cs> my lords when your lordships discussed this question at the last stage my noble friend lord avon agreed to consider all the ideas and points put forward in that debate <e> <s> the government were open to suggestion and continue to be so about this important and rather difficult matter <e> <s> if i may put in a plug for the team on the bill so far <e> <s> perhaps i might say that the difficult we manage to do at once the impossible takes consultation <e> <s> however having considered everything that was said before and is now being said i am still not convinced that any of the ideas that your lordships have come up with is better than the title we have now <e> <s> but i agree that it is by no means perfect <e> <s> it is rather long and rather solemn my noble friend lord montagu made that point hut it has the most unusual virtue of being accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house just to answer the noble earl lord perth i hope i made it clear that the governments mind is entirely open on this matter <e> <s> therefore there is no pressing case for him to vote with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to cross swords with my noble friend on a point of this nature but i think that perhaps the question should be put before we discuss it <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will allow me to say so we appear to be getting into the most terrible procedural muddle <e> <s> i am not sure whether in fact the noble baroness is moving her amendment or not but since we are now discussing matters on the basis that the amendment has been moved perhaps she should do so <e>", "<cs> but the question has not been put my lords that is my point <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be an appropriate moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report on this bill be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the brevity with which he has moved this the first in a series of amendments designed to extend the responsibilities of the commission and the secretary of state to include parks designed landscapes and other land of outstanding architectural and artistic rather than just historic interest <e> <s> although specific points in the amendments vary their general principle is the same and therefore i would like to direct my remarks to the principle behind them all <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important to consider once again the commissions major and priority task which the government are convinced must be to fulfil its main duties in respect of buildings and monuments <e> <s> within that task it is right and sensible that gardens should be included and that land associated with an historic building or ancient monument perhaps itself long disappeared should also be included <e>", "<cs> my lords this gun is obviously rather modern having considerably more than two barrels but let us see how we get on with it as we proceed <e> <s> these amendments seek to extend the commissions and the secretary of states power to make grants to the national trust as we have already heard towards the cost of acquiring property <e> <s> the current powers cover only buildings of outstanding historic and architectural interest <e> <s> the amendments would also cover parks and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to no <e> <s> i too should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the first part of the first two of these amendments is concerned to ensure that endowments can be accepted in respect of both monuments and buildings and that the present wording of the relevant section of the historic buildings and ancient monuments act does not preclude associated land <e> <s> i am happy to say that these amendments are not necessary <e> <s> they are already covered by the existing wording of the legislation <e> <s> there is however one gap which my noble friend identified in paragraph of schedule where the new section of the act does not presently cover endowments in respect of monuments or buildings in the commissions guardianship <e> <s> a government amendment will be brought forward to cover that point <e> <s> i cannot guarantee that it will be in this house it could well be in another place <e> <s> but i give the assurance that one will come forward <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another but rather more complicated amendment based on the principle that the commission should be responsible in some way for protecting important gardens parks and other landscapes although it represents a change from a similar amendment which was discussed in committee <e> <s> as my noble friend lord avon said at that stage and possibly earlier even though this amendment provides no enforcement procedure to assist the protection of these gardens such a procedure the mandatory requirement to produce a register would potentially form a major distraction for the new commission in their early years from what the government see as their major tasks a point which i have already made this evening <e> <s> in particular the government would not want to see anything slow up the programme of the accelerated listing resurvey which is now getting well into its stride <e> <s> the amendment envisages that the commission will have a major consultative role to play but the wide range of notification requirements would lead to a very considerable if not impossible practical difficulty for the commission and a very considerable extra burden on limited resources <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i gree with most of what has been said by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> i do not see any conflict nor do the countryside commission with whom i have discussed this matter <e> <s> it may be that they will come to an agreed designation system between themselves which would draw attention to the problems of those gardens on the list <e> <s> but surely this is a matter for interaction between them and not something we should make statutory as a leading responsibility and duty on a new commission from the outset <e>", "<cs> my lords circular / gives advice to local authorities on how the government expect them to handle planning applications <e> <s> it asks local authorities to look sympathetically at applications for the reuse of redundant buildings including farm buildings by small-scale businesses <e> <s> it is our understanding in general that local authorities are reponding positively to this advice <e> <s> in cases where this does not appear to he so there is of course the right of appeal <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the development commission has a redundant farm buildings scheme under which cosira will in worse off rural areas provide grants of up to per cent <e> <s> of the cost of conversion for craft and light industrial use but i am afraid that i must tell the house that take-up so far has been disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would accept what the noble lord says that there is a certain amount of short-term use of this sort of building-but i am afraid i can give him no answer on what alleviation in the rates for these purposes we might consider <e> <s> so far as i know this is a problem which has not been considered up to now but i certainly take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of my noble friends supplementary is th november <e> <s> may i ask him to repeat the second part <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that and if it is true i would regard it as most deplorable <e>", "<cs> the government are not responsible for the tabling of questions my lords only for answering them <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have no idea my lords but i will find out and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and that is exactly the purpose of the circular we are discussing <e> <s> as for the question of reversal it is of course within the applicants rights to apply to the secretary of state first if the planning permission has not been decided within eight weeks and secondly if it is turned down <e>", "<cs> my lords local planning authorities have statutory responsibility for the day-to-day control of development within their areas <e> <s> the policy of the government is that individual applications for planning permission should be taken out of the hands of a local authority only in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> these usually involve matters of national or regional significance <e> <s> the issues related to the redevelopment of the kensington town hall site are of local significance only and call-in of any planning application is not therefore justified <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation in this case is that the borough of kensington and chelsea <e>", "<cs> my lords this is exactly the kind of moral argument which i said i was not prepared to be drawn into <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the least idea why they undertook the action that they did <e> <s> all i know is that the action has happened <e> <s> the town hall which i visited this morning is in a totally unsatisfactory state <e> <s> therefore my own

acted in any way differently from the way he would have done in the circumstances i apologise <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords <e> <s> as i sought to explain in my original answer this is a local problem

important and fundamental of mans needs and therefore it is of no surprise to me that so many of your lordships have chosen to enter the fray on the second reading of this bill and that this debate has attracted not one but two maiden speeches <e> <s> the noble baroness lady nicol who was introduced to your lordships only the other day is as we have heard a lady of wide experience as regards local authorities and research into job satisfaction <e> <s> her speech of course bore out that experience <e> <s> the noble lord lord hemingford also brought his experience of the press to bear on this matter of the water bill <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear from them again on a wide range of subjects both soon and often and with the exceptional brevity with which they have both spoken to us today <e> <s> i must compliment them on their models of uncontroversiality on what has become as the noble lord lord winstanley has said a very controversial subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise it was a third <e> <s> but i am sure the noble baroness will take the point <e> <s> this bill is aimed at a completely different subject <e> <s> we are not dismantling the water industry carrying out further reorganisation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but like other noble lords i have listened to the noble baroness for a considerable amount of time and perhaps she will bear with me a little longer <e>

"<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness will bear with me a fraction longer because i am indeed going to answer the very points which have been raised but i must be allowed to put them into my own context <e> <s> as i was saying we are not interfering with those arrangements <e> <s> the purpose of our bill is to reduce the burden of central bureaucracy to improve methods of decision-making and to improve arrangements at the local level for the <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of lengthening my speech even more unduly than it has been lengthened already by interruptions perhaps this is a point to which we might return in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i am unable to give my noble friend that information at the moment but i shall write to him <e> <s> the role of exports has been mentioned by my noble friends lord montgomery and lord sandford and others <e> <s> water authorities and water companies have operational management and technical expertise which is in demand in developing countries <e> <s> meeting this demand can draw in british firms who can also use this expertise to strengthen and complement their bids for overseas business <e> <s> the aim is to win a larger share of the export market where the scope for expansion is very large indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> i had a note on it <e> <s> i certainly agree with my noble friend on the effects of the strike on the <e>", "<cs> my lords sir ralph verney has had a long and distinguished career of public service <e> <s> he has given dedicated service to the nature conservancy council in a difficult three years during which the wildlife and countryside act was passed <e> <s> the nature conservancy council has a monumental task ahead of it in the implementation of the wildlife provisions in the act <e> <s> we feel that it is necessary to appoint a younger chairman who we hope will be able to see us through the whole of this period <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hoped to indicate in my original answer i subscribe to every word which my noble friend has said about sir ralphs occupancy of the job of chairman of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> however i was glad to note that my noble friend used the expression decision not to reappoint and not other more emotive words which have been used recently in the press <e> <s> sir ralph verney was appointed as chairman of the nature conservancy council for three years commencing on st may <e> <s> the previous chairmen of the nature <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last few weeks i have seen many press reports and letters on this subject <e> <s> they are as distressing to me as i know they are to sir ralph himself <e> <s> he will indeed be a most difficult man to follow <e> <s> i should like to put it on record now that the person we are looking for should not only be young enough to serve at least a second term but should also have the qualities which will enable him to carry with him the whole of the conservation movement including the farmers and the other bodies with which a chairman in such a position has to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it is proper for me to engage in a discussion of any sort on the subject of venerability <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it was a coincidence but i can say quite categorically that it had no bearing whatsoever on the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i can speak for the government <e> <s> i cannot speak for back-benchers either here or in another place <e> <s> that is the answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary <e> <s> as to the second part of his supplementary question the noble lord will very well know that there was an open meeting at the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords that is a totally different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is now a convenient moment for your lordships if i repeat the statement currently being made in another place on the subject of prefabricated reinforced concrete houses <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord hooson for their general welcome to the statement <e> <s> i am prepared to agree straight away that a disturbing state of affairs has arisen with these particular houses <e> <s> the first point i wish to make particularly to the noble baroness is that the problem that has become evident with the orlit houses is totally different from that which she mentioned in relation to airey houses <e> <s> with airey houses as i understand it the problem is that the reinforcement tubes are deteriorating whereas in this case it is the concrete itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the list to which the noble lord lord kennet has referred does not mean to me that in the light of scientific knowledge at the time and that phrase is important because we are talking about houses which were built originally between the wars the justification for going ahead with these particular building programmes was quite self-evidently there <e> <s> over the period which is well over years there has been a considerable improvement in both research and the practical effects of research into building all kinds of houses including the prefabricated ones that we are discussing this afternoon <e> <s> naturally ministers in successive governments and i have no doubt that this will apply in future governments were able to consider the advice that they were given at a particular time bearing in mind that in the future subsequent scientific development might make the advice invalid <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords questions tempt me into doing something which i know is an unforgivable sin in this house passing off <e> <s> the noble lord knows far more about the scottish situation than i can ever hope to know <e> <s> however <e> <s> i can tell him that of the houses were built in scotland <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot without notice tell the noble lord when the last one was built but my understanding is that it was probably in <e> <s> if there is any difference about that i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would say that it was quite analogous with dry rot in timber because it involves a progressive failure of the concrete caused by chlorides <e> <s> as to how far and how long it will go i am afraid that at the moment in the light of the scientific evidence i am not able to tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house would agree with the noble lord lord winstanley that there is still scope for improvement but possibly not today and not now <e> <s> this suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house to my noble friends second point i agree <e> <s> to his first point however i am certainly not shilly-shallying around <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said this is a further amendment on the subject upon which we had considerable discussions during previous stages of the bill <e> <s> as has been said this particular amendment seeks only discretionary power to <e>", "<cs> my lords there are such orders <e>", "<cs> my lords each organisation when it is decided to have members here or to grant immunities in this country to that organisation is discussed with her majestys government on its merits <e> <s> the noble lord gave a whole list of things to which immunities and privileges could apply <e> <s> there are two things to which they certainly do not apply one is car tax and the other is parking fines <e>", "<cs> my lords i must take issue with the noble lord about such matters passing into law by way of statutory instruments without debate <e> <s> i myself conducted three such orders through your lordships house on rd february when the noble lord lord oram spoke from the opposition front bench so they were certainly discussed <e> <s> generally speaking it has been the policy of successive governments to welcome the establishment of international organisations in the united kingdom <e> <s> in recent years especially since the establishment of the united nations in an increasing volume of very important work is done by these organisations and we should be proud grateful and willing to have them here <e>", "<cs> my lords i completely agree with the noble and learned lord who i am sure will remember as i do that there was some discussion recently about having the european parliament in victoria station <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the numbers of representatives and the number of organisations are both agreed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords absolutely <e> <s> that is why each organisation has its particular immunities and privilages examined on their merits and they vary considerably between the various organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords in england and wales there are some water meters in domestic premises and about water meters in non-household premises <e> <s> separate figures for commercial premises are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not yet clear how many people nationwide would benefit from a metering scheme such as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> a survey conducted by severn trent water authority suggests that only about per cent <e> <s> of households in their area would be likely to benefit from the metering option <e> <s> however the government have made a policy that all domestic consumers wherever they live in either england or wales shall have the option of securing water meters if they so want <e>", "<cs> my lords the that the noble baroness refers to is the approximate maximum cost and refers to outside water meters <e> <s> of course many of these meters could well be inside the house and could be fixed for example by do-it-yourself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly do that <e> <s> i am afraid not now but in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it could be done by do-it-yourself enthusiasts but also it could be done under contract with a local plumber which of course would involve a slightly higher charge because you would have to pay the plumber <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking on this question about a general subject not a specific one of this particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord nathan for asking this question <e> <s> that so much of this brief debate has been well-informed is due in no small measure to the efforts of the noble lord himself <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady white has made clear there is widespread interest in this subject following almost a decade of intense debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord nathan has gathered about him a whole galaxy of noble lords who are both knowledgeable and if i dare say so impressive in their experience and expertise <e> <s> their views will of course continue to be very carefully considered by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the current plan is that this will be a joint project but as i say discussions are still continuing and i am unable to make any definitive announcement at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the minister for sport reconvened last november the liaison group of representatives from the government the football association and representative bodies originally set up to oversee arrangements for the world cup finals in spain <e> <s> this group

clubs are in what are currently deprived inner city areas <e> <s> the government are going a long way to improve these areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the policemen inside the ground are there at the invitation of the club concerned <e> <s> i assume from this that the club pay for their time while the policemen are on duty <e> <s> i must confess that i am not sure about this answer and i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but this question on the order paper relates specifically to football hooliganism and to neither cricket nor australia <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have first-hand experience of this but i take the word of the noble baroness for it and i shall most certainly take it up with my right honourable and honourable friends in the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends whether one takes ones mind off it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords research is going on <e> <s> i am happy to be able to say that the government currently have a research contract with leicester university on the causes of football hooliganism <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept the noble lords word on that <e> <s> i am sure that he is right <e> <s> regarding whether it is the supporters or the supporters club which is involved i think that on very very rare occasions it could be a small minority of people in the supporters club but almost entirely it would be outsiders as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is why we are taking the subject so seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that it is not the policemen on the beat who are involved in this but british transport police <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord todd for raising this question today <e> <s> as he remarked or almost remarked it gives me the opportunity to expand on the written answer given in another place on nd december of last year <e> <s> even if i was not before tonights brief debate has made me fully aware of the concern expressed by your lordships select committee over the adequacy of the research effort available to the forestry industry something which my noble friend lord dulverton referred to as the natural fears which have arisen over the move of the princes risborough laboratory from princes risborough to garston <e> <s> it might be appropriate if i commented at this point on what was said by my noble friend lord inglewood <e> <s> nobody who has spoken tonight would deny the tremendous expertise and international following of the laboratory itself <e> <s> but this is not a geographical fact <e> <s> it stands uniquely on its own as a research establishment due to its own efforts and those of its staff over the years wherever it happened to be situated <e>", "<cs> it falls to my lot for the third time this week in your lordships house to return to the subject of research <e> <s> all that i can say tonight is that it has been well worth waiting in the wings <e> <s> at this time of night i am unable to answer this very important amendment which as we have heard comes from the deliberations of your lordships select committee on science and technology quite as fully as i would had we been at an earlier stage in the afternoon <e> <s> nonetheless i have listened with very great interest to the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord sherfield in support of his amendment in connection with research <e> <s> they speak with all the authority of your lordships select committee on science and technology <e> <s> the department will of course in due course and in the usual way be making a full reply to that committees recent and let me say meaty report on the water industry which was presented on th december last <e> <s> it raises a wide range of important issues but the present debate is concerned only with research as such and is the subject of its sixth chapter <e> <s> i shall confine myself to this subject <e> <s> i should say straightaway to both the noble earl lord shannon and my noble friend lord cranbrook who both supported the concept of the amendment that so do the government <e>", "<cs> much of what i said on the last amendment is relevant also to this amendment which as the noble lord lord sherfield has just said moves from the general to the particular <e> <s> this second new clause would require water authorities in england and wales and scotland and also water companies to belong to a water research association such as the water research centre <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord one second <e> <s> although the power exists i did not say that it was a theoretical power <e> <s> i said that its use was probably theoretical because it would not be required <e>", "<cs> my lords the current stabilisation work on the terrace is due for completion in july <e> <s> in his press announcement of th august my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment said that the main development of the richmond yard site which includes the restoration of richmond terrace will commence in <e> <s> the property services agency is considering arrangements for the handling of the development with a view to completing it no later

as the removable fixtures and fittings are concerned if that is not a contradiction in terms i can confirm that these were surveyed and that the important items which will be relevant to the history of the house have been put in store and are being properly looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords looking over the old home might be more appropriate when it is completely restored and rebuilt <e> <s> however i shall certainly look into the matter and advise the noble viscount <e> <s> so far as viewing the artefacts is concerned if the noble viscount wishes to burrow into packing cases in the south midlands i am sure that can be arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords the identification and notification of sssis is a duty which parliament has placed upon the nature conservancy council <e> <s> it is not for the government to agree or disagree with the councils individual decisions provided they are satisfied that they are properly exercising the duty placed upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am totally dismayed by the attitude which is being taken by some people and i deplore the kind of demonstration to which the noble lord lord melchett has just referred <e> <s> however i believe that these actions are based on unjustified fears and misunderstandings about the effects of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> now that all the provisions of the act are in force and financial guidance is available i hope that matters can be brought back into reasonable perspective <e> <s> further to that i have to announce that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is this saturday to make his postponed visit together with the parliamentary under-secretary at the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food and the chairman of the nature conservancy council to talk to the farmers on west sedgemoor <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we covered this point very well in the question and answer session that we had the other day <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords i can repeat the second half of my original answer <e> <s> it is not for the government to agree or disagree with the councils individual decisions provided and this is the important point that should strike home to the noble lord lord melchett the government are satisfied that the council are properly exercising the duty placed upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords responsibility for assisting homeless people rests with local authorities under the housing homeless persons act <e> <s> this act gives priority to certain defined categories of people including single people if they are considered to be vulnerable <e> <s> the impact of homelessness is one of the factors taken into account in determining local authorities capital expenditure allocations <e> <s> it is for individual authorities themselves to decide how much they should spend on meeting the needs of single homeless people <e> <s> the single homeless will also benefit from the substantial provision for hostels and other forms of shared housing in the housing corporations approved development programme <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the general duty of the department of health and social security as reflected by the act the noble lord mentioned he is of course quite right for those people who come within the meaning of that act which does not completely overlap with the homeless persons act to which i referred in my original answer <e> <s> none the less the housing stock as such is the responsibility of the local authorities so to that extent i hope he will agree with the substance of my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the government regard this problem with the greatest seriousness as i know the noble baroness knows <e> <s> i hope i have done nothing in answering this question to detract from that seriousness <e> <s> of course we are fully aware of the problems of single people who are homeless and we are taking action in the ways that i have already suggested in answering the supplementary questions of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i said that decisions are going to be made shortly and i cannot at this moment go further than this <e> <s> with regard to the allowances to which the noble baroness refers this is a new one to me but i will certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords again i take the serious purport of the noble lords question <e> <s> the government make grants to local authorities this is related specifically to the housing grants and also to the grants related expenditure what one might call the supplementary rates for ease of argument <e> <s> so the government are financially helping local authorities to do what should be done <e> <s> the fact is that this particular housing problem is on a scale which i and the noble lord most certainly deplore <e> <s> if the local authorities take money from one part of the housing budget to put into another part the first part of the housing budget necessarily suffers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it clear that the government are already providing grant money to the local authorities and to the housing associations to fulfil this particular need <e> <s> so far as housebuilding generally is concerned it is my understanding that the figures of new building have risen consistently over the last three periods for which figures have been reported <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as evenness goes i must point out to my noble friend that the grant is not evenly spread either <e> <s> the grant goes in a large proportion to those areas and to those local authorities which are seen to need it <e> <s> as regards going to a particular station or area of the country yes i most certainly would readily do that <e> <s> i remember some years ago not having been prompted but off my own bat going very late at about oclock in the morning to waterloo station <e> <s> as long ago as that i was very conscious of the problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly and i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my right honourable friend to whom i have already referred in answering this question and also my right honourable friend the minister for housing will most certainly consider all the points that have arisen in the supplementaries to the question of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> as far as the social security act goes it is my understanding that should the absolute disaster threaten hostels that the noble lord i am not sure whether he anticipates or fears but i rather hope the latter there would be no question but that the residents would be rehoused <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to parliamentary approval the united kingdom will contribute million to unicefs general resources this year <e> <s> it is impossible to say how much british firms will earn from unicef orders but in recent years the figure has consistently been in excess of million united states dollars <e> <s> such orders are placed by unicef of course on the basis of their own estimate of the best value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether i ought to answer the questions in the reverse order as the noble lord did in dealing with my first answer <e> <s> however i can tell him that whether or not we make a profit out of this deal is in fact a happy accident <e> <s> there is no planned relationship between the level of united kingdom contribution and the amount unicef spends here on procurement <e> <s> the latter figure depends on a number of variable factors such as the level of united kingdom prices and the rates of exchange between the pound and other currencies <e> <s> over the five years to unicef procurement in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think she has <e> <s> at the meeting with mr james grant to which the noble lord referred my right honourable friend the prime minister reaffirmed her strong support for unicef and said that we would maintain our contribution at a good level as in the past <e> <s> if this figure of million for is approved by parliament it will be the largest ever british contribution to unicefs general resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is in danger of not comparing like with like <e> <s> i specifically referred to unicefs general resources <e> <s> in the past the figures have very often included special one-off projects <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously as is so often the case there is a lot of force in what the noble lord lord brockway says <e> <s> certainly i have noted the report indeed i have it in front of me <e> <s> unicef has identified four areas of work which are vitally needed for the aid of children these are oral rehydration therapy the universal immunisation of children the promotion of breast feeding and the widespread use of infant growth charts <e> <s> the government very much approve of all these projects <e>", "<cs> my lords when i described the profit as a happy accident i meant exactly what i said <e> <s> there is no guarantee that by spending extra money in this particular area of our aid budget we would continue to have the satisfactory procurement arrangements which have so far held in regard to unicef <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the second part of the noble lords question we are proposing to parliament that we should make an allocation of million which will to a large extent go into the four projects to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a reduction because as i said to the noble lord lord oram in previous years the money included special projects which were one-off affairs <e> <s> this year we are talking about unicefs general resources <e> <s> they are two different things <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid not <e> <s> i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i fail to see the relevance between the finances of unicef and the general aid budget which may or may not reflect upon the defence policy of either her majestys government or other governments overseas <e> <s> so far as my complacency goes that is not for me to judge <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom national committee last year raised slightly over <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have with me last years figure for our direct contribution to unicef

iran of course the government are well aware of this <e> <s> i would like to refer the noble lord to the speech that my noble friend lord colville of culross made the other day during the human rights debate of the united nations in which he pressed the very points to which the noble lord has alluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that fact but if it is so most certainly the government would support just such a move <e> <s> i should point out that iran has subscribed to united nations covenants on human rights and i would say that it is only reasonable for the world community to encourage countries to observe the undertakings which they sign <e>", "<cs> my lords an iranian who is a member of the bahai faith would qualify for recognition as a refugee in this country and would therefore be protected from return to iran <e> <s> so the answer to the noble lords question is yes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the speech of my noble friend lord colville to which i referred earlier included these points <e> <s> it is exactly for the reason that the noble and learned lord has adduced that this international pressure is being put on the iranian government at the moment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords absolutely but in this respect we are acting as i said in my original answer through the good offices of the ten <e>", "<cs> my lords human rights are human rights wherever they occur <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord nugent spoke also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> with permission i should like to do the same <e> <s> as the first chairman of the national water council there is no one in this committee who speaks more knowledgeably than my noble friend on matters relating to the water industry pension fund which is at present a responsibility of the council

for discussion <e> <s> the noble baroness is quite right when she says that the yorkshire water authority would be appropriate but that has not been decided <e> <s> the reason that it is appropriate is that most of the pension staff are employed in sheffield which is within the area of the yorkshire water authority <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships committee will accept that i am second to none inside or outside the chamber in my determination to see the principles of conservation prosper <e> <s> i hope that the committee will also accept the fact that i appreciate the concern which the government most definitely share that land should not be taken either unnecessarily or arbitrarily for the purpose of reservoir construction <e> <s> it is therefore with sincere regret that i must tell the committee that the effect of the proposed new clause would be damaging to the interests which quite naturally its sponsors wish to protect <e> <s> it would succeed in ensuring neither that certain kinds of land are taken for a reservoir only when absolutely necessary nor as the noble lord lord melchett has said he requires that a reservoir is built only if water from existing resources is used to the utmost <e> <s> the planning legislation as it stands together with section of the water act do that better and i hope that your lordships committee will agree not to disturb it <e>", "<cs> i think that i should have to consider that point and return to it if i may <e>", "<cs> yes but i would suggest that that is rather off the basic point of the argument in that the reservoir has already been built <e> <s> there is a perfectly good argument which i have a feeling the noble lord lord melchett might well accept that in the reduction of the amount of water in the particular reservoir to which my noble friend and the noble lord lord winstanley have been referring there is increased opportunity for conservation of wildlife and plant life <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i had indeed entirely missed the point of what he had been saying and i am obliged for that elaboration <e>", "<cs> yes i did understand that noble lord correctly the reduction of demand by the use of conservation measures if i may put it that way within a particular industry or a particular domestic user <e> <s> i am not able to give an off-the-cuff answer to that tonight but i will write to the noble lord <e> <s> i have spoken of the worthy objectives of this amendment <e> <s> that they are worthy has been evidenced by the general support received from all quarters of the committee <e> <s> as i have said without further thought i believe that the amendment does not achieve its stated objectives and that existing legislation is adequate to achieve them <e> <s> i hope the committee will agree with that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is confusing two situations <e> <s> what he is looking at at the moment is past reservoir building in todays conditions <e> <s> what i am saying is that the planning law was perfectly adequate at the time to give the necessary safeguards safeguards which the noble lord lord melchett and my noble friend who put his name to this amendment genuinely and sincerely desired <e> <s> i must say that i agree with them <e>", "<cs> perhaps on this amendment particularly i can produce yet another thatcherite argument for not accepting it <e> <s> i would refer the committee to the actual wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid it would not get over my basic hurdle of what the nature conservancy council is to do with this information once it has it <e> <s> considerable delays could well be caused by opponents of sensitive schemes requiring detailed discussion of what is as i have said several times in my reply to this short debate no more than a basic test of economic viability <e> <s> on all these counts i would ask the noble lord to reconsider this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with this amendment he has not commented very carefully upon my statement that the land drainage matters are currently subject to review by the inter-departmental committee upon which ministers intend shortly to publish a discussion paper <e> <s> will not the noble lord therefore agree with me that it will be inappropriate to write this into the bill either at the committee stage or at the next stage before the matter can be considered by that review committee and a discussion paper published upon it <e>", "<cs> the review began at the end of last year and it is impossible for me to be definitive as to when the discussion paper might be published <e> <s> the review is not yet finished <e> <s> the report stage is due to take place i believe at about the beginning of april <e> <s> i very much doubt whether the discussion paper will have been published by then <e> <s> if however the committee is beginning to be swayed by this part of my argument the normal way of conducting these affairs would be to allow the inter-departmental committee to report to have discussions on the document to have proposals submitted to my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture and subsequently to legislate if it is agreed so to do <e> <s> that i should have thought would be the reasonable procedure to follow in this case <e>", "<cs> i thought that i was going to start by being grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for his acute observations because i was going to make a rather different point that amendments nos <e> <s> to also have the same defence although there are other specific defences which i shall make to those amendments if they are moved <e> <s> it is rather difficult to stand here and answer hypothetical questions from the noble lord lord melchett about what may or may not be in a review which is being conducted at the moment <e> <s> to suggest that the committee will have a sharp edge only if it has treasury approval and has treasury representatives upon it is going a little far <e> <s> so often have i heard the noble lord use exactly the opposite argument <e> <s> however i can assure him that even if they were not going to do so before todays debate the interdepartmental committee will most certainly look at every word which has been said in this short debate on the subject of cost-benefit appraisals <e> <s> what i cannot do is to prejudice the outcome of their investigation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i do not have quite the same respect for governments as the noble lord lord melchett but i cannot see any good reason whatever why the inter-departmental committee should not examine my words just as they might examine his words or those of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> with regard to his general point about the interdepartmental committee i did not say it was a committee looking at cost-benefit appraisals <e> <s> what i said was that the committee was looking at the whole field of land drainage and i would now make sure that it also looked at the cost-benefit appraisals <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether it will be the review or the subsequent consultation that will bring up the noble lords points but i am convinced that by whatever method they will be looked at both objectively and fairly <e>", "<cs> i must be in an unduly cynical frame of mind this evening <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept that even if other parties do not the government speak with one voice at any one time <e> <s> the decision to hold a public inquiry is made by a minister on behalf of the entire government <e> <s> it is very difficult for me to see the practical advantage in increasing the number of ministers involved <e> <s> government policy in regard to potential conflicts between the interests concerned with or likely to be affected by a land drainage scheme is to encourage maximum consultation between the different interests in order to secure a solution acceptable to all <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that yet again i must disagree with the noble lord lord melchett on the subject of this amendment <e> <s> he must i feel be prepared to distinguish between two different things one is the membership of the water authorities themselves and the second is the membership of the regional land drainage committees <e> <s> they are two completely separate entities <e>", "<cs> perhaps we should not preempt the discussion on a subsequent amendment <e> <s> what i meant was that the noble lord announced his remarks by saying that we now come rather closer to the main purport of the bill or words to that effect <e> <s> i was merely pointing out that i disagreed slightly with him <e>", "<cs> i take the point of the noble lord lord howie of troon that to him and his colleagues in the civil engineering field the conservationists are tiresome people but without entering into an argument on the subject perhaps he will accept that in the conservationists eyes the boot is on the other foot <e>", "<cs> land drainage is one of the fundamental duties of the water authorities and conservtion is also a duty but that is one i am told which is incidental to their functions <e> <s> but i do very much take the point of the noble baroness lady white and i have absolutely no doubt that that will be considered at some stage during the consultation process to which we have already referred on numerous occasions <e>", "<cs> with such a tutor as my noble friend lord bellwin sitting beside me on this bench most certainly i shall take every opportunity to reconsider both what i have said and what the noble lord lord melchett and others have said during the course of this short debate <e> <s> i shall certainly take it away and look at the whole thing but i must in all fairness and honesty say that as far as i can see at the moment the prognosis is not particularly good <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett has just said that he has not had very much luck with me as regards his previous amendments <e> <s> i must say that i am beginning to feel that i have an eel as my kinsman <e> <s> be that as it may i am afraid that i must tell the noble lord that in my view this particular amendment is rather akin to a house that is based on sand <e> <s> i appreciate the concern of the noble lord let us get that straight right away <e> <s> this amendment seeks to provide an exemption from liability to some of the drainage rates which are levied in respect of land which has been designated as a nature reserve and so on <e> <s> the amendment as drafted probably does not meet the noble lords intention as it only provides exemption in respect of drainage rates which are made to meet the costs of new and improvement works <e> <s> but even if that were not the case i would have <e>", "<cs> perhaps i was not enunciating clearly but in any case the noble lord did not let me finish my sentence <e> <s> i was saying that this amendment only provides an exemption in respect of the costs of new and improvement works <e> <s> even if that were not the case i would have reservations about the proposal <e>", "<cs> i must say that i really cannot agree with the noble lord lord melchett that the land value is high necessarily because of the nature conservation interest <e> <s> the noble lord says go to west sedgemoor <e> <s> the fact is that one simply cannot buy any large areas of west sedgemoor because it is split up into very small areas often owned independently by absentee landlords and because the almost napoleonic code has applied to that particular area of the country <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that the reason why land prices in west sedgemoor are so high is that the individual plots of land are so small <e> <s> it has nothing to do with conservation interests whatever <e> <s> however i accept that there is a problem here with which i have not been able to deal satisfactorily this evening i readily concede that <e> <s> i should like to take the matter away and look at it <e>", "<cs> at the risk of putting the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran totally off his stride would it be convenient to the committee to take the subsequent two amendments with this amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said the question raised by amendment no <e> <s> was fully debated in standing committee on the bill in another place on an amendment which he did not say was identical in phraseology to the one moved by the noble lord today <e> <s> he referred to the <e>", "<cs> what i was trying to point out was that although in certain respects the common-wealth development corporation is well within the public sector and of course comes within the remit of the public sector borrowing requirement the activity in which it is engaged in costa rica has a very private face <e>", "<cs> i rather think that the noble lord lord winstanley is in danger of putting the cart before the horse because he has reversed the argument i was trying to make <e> <s> this was not that one should be suspicious of the guidelines because they are not <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i said i was beginning to understand <e> <s> i did not say i had anything like the experience of the noble lord lord howie of troon <e>", "<cs> if we look at the guidelines and indeed clause of the bill which i have temporarily mislaid but i think i remember it correctly the secretary of state has to give his consent before the public sector is allowed to do anything in connection with clause <e> <s> what my honourable friend said the other day in another place and what i am saying now is that in cases of danger of competition between the public and private sectors this is something he would have very much in mind and he would see the public sector as being an adjunct to and not a competitor of the private sector <e> <s> i hope that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> that is the sort of thing which will be going through the secretary of states mind <e> <s> what i will have to take advice on if i may write to the noble lord is whether it ought to be specifically written down <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e>", "<cs> no i did not say anything of the sort <e> <s> what i said was that i was not sure whether the points raised by the noble lord would be more appropriate to be in the mind of the secretary of state or in the guidelines and that i will take advice which is very different <e>", "<cs> that remains to be seen <e> <s> it is exactly what we aim to discover <e>", "<cs> yes until this evening we did consider the guidelines as final but after todays short debate i will of course consider whether they are totally final <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether it is an appropriate subject for report because of course an amendment would need to be moved to do it but i shall certainly find out about this and at the very least write to the noble baroness <e> <s> perhaps it may be appropriate to put it in <e>", "<cs> although a vaguely similar provision for damage from water escapes is in the water act as my noble friend lord sandys has said the government are not able to accept this amendment <e> <s> i specifically use the word vaguely because there is some similarity here so far as the issue of principle goes but we do not believe that the two cases have any similarity as regards the practicalities of the matter <e>", "<cs> this amendment stands very definitely on its own <e> <s> it was never proposed either days ago or again today with the revamp of ideas from both opposition and the government that the noble lords amendment should be included in any block grouping <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley seems to be making a habit this evening of shooting my foxes before i even see them <e> <s> however we shall see how we get on with this one <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful as i know my noble friend the chief whip is to my noble friend lord sandys for speaking to both of his amendments together <e> <s> my noble friend has referred to the historical background of this matter and i therefore need not repeat it <e> <s> however i would add one very important point in case there should be any doubt on the matter <e> <s> the water authorities and their predecessors have always been obliged to compensate people for any damage they may have sustained in the course of their sewer or main-laying activities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might presage what i have to say by saying that no one has been casting what my five-year-old son calls nasturtions on the length of speeches of noble lords <e> <s> the first point i must make in all this is that clause imposes a clear duty on the water authorities to prepare a report on arrangements to represent the interests of consumers <e> <s> once that report is approved by the secretary of state it will be the duty of the water authority to implement the arrangements <e> <s> it is quite clear that this imposes an obligation that arrangements are to be established and must be arrangements to represent the interests of consumers or the water authority will be in breach of its statutory duty <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> this is very complicated <e> <s> there are three different sets of guidelines attached to this bill <e> <s> i am talking about those published on nd november last while the bill was in another place <e> <s> i have them in my hand at the moment <e> <s> they have been available since that time <e> <s> if any members of the committee have not got them it would perhaps be wise not to speak much more until they have had time to consider them <e> <s> i do not know what the committee feels on that score <e>", "<cs> yes that is what i meant by both sets <e>", "<cs> it has not as i understand it yet been decided whether automatically a member of the water authority would be on the committees at all <e> <s> but i understand that it would be totally within their power to co-opt a member of the water authorities to sit with them <e> <s> it would then be up to the committees themselves to decide whether that water authority member whether he was co-opted or not should be chairman <e> <s> i do not think it is desirable in all cases that the water authority appointee or member however he gets there should necessarily become chairman of the committee <e>", "<cs> i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge and belief copies are available or were available in the printed paper office <e> <s> if not i shall most certainly make it my business to make sure that they are available there from now on <e>", "<cs> i am advised that it would be quite improper not to say out of order in your lordships committee to have included in the <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes to both questions <e>", "<cs> we now get from the general i suppose in a sense to the specific although i have been at pains on the earlier amendments to point out that we are talking about two or possible more totally separate committees <e> <s> i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> the consumer consultative committees are designed to deal with the broad policy and as the noble baroness said the methods costings prices charged local authority interests and so on of the water authorities themselves however the recreation and conservation committees as i said and i repeat will be on a regional basis because we do not see that it is appropriate either to duplicate the water space amenity commission at the one end or to have them in such small units that they are sub-regional at the other end <e>", "<cs> in this connection it would indeed mean the water authorities chairmens association or one of the water authorities nominated by it whichever was appropriate <e> <s> however the point i seek to make is that whoever ends up doing it will not go out of existence if they are currently doing a useful job which that particular committee is most certainly doing <e>", "<cs> what i am trying to say to the noble baroness is that this standing technical advisory committee on water quality has no relevance to consumer consultative committees <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that it does not and there is no need for it to have such a relationship <e> <s> it will be continued but as a completely separate entity from the committees that we are discussing in this and previous amendments <e>", "<cs> yes i do agree that this is on the face of it confusing <e> <s> the point is that as my noble friend has just said clause deals with consumer consultative committees <e> <s> what i am saying and the government have been saying since i think the committee stage in another place is that there are various kinds of consumer and there are two sorts of consumers committee first what i call the general consumer consultative committees which i described just now to the noble baroness lady fisher and secondly the specific ones which are those on recreation and conservation which up to as recently as i think the beginning of last week it was intended should be rolled together as one body <e> <s> but i am now able to tell the committee that we are considering with some urgency the points that have already been put to us this evening on whether in fact the recreation amenity and conservation bodies are compatible <e>", "<cs> i am obviously not making myself in the least bit clear <e> <s> the consumer consultative committees are totally separate from those committees that we are discussing at the moment <e> <s> those that we are discussing now will be on a regional basis whereas the consumer consultative committees as my noble friend has just said will be in very much smaller local areas which one might call either districts sub-regional or whatever <e>", "<cs> yes fine <e> <s> as regards the point made by the noble lord lord melchett perhaps i could have phrased my remarks more felicitously and instead of saying if there are existing links between conservation bodies and water authorities that work currently the situation will not change i should have said where there are <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will accept that not every rose in this particular garden is quite as beautiful as every other rose <e> <s> in other words there are occasions when things are not working quite satisfactorily <e> <s> however the government do not propose to change things which are working well <e> <s> i hope that that makes the point absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the advice of the noble lord lord howie but i was i hope in the process of making it quite clear that there was nothing in clause to stop the existing arrangements <e> <s> i hope that this goes as far as even the noble lord lord melchett would like me to go <e> <s> they will continue <e> <s> having said that i will most certainly consider the point <e>", "<cs> i would not dream of taking it anything but seriously especially after the remarks of the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie of troon is about to provide the government with the opportunity to respond positively to the conclusion of your lordships select committee that the reservoirs act should not be left on the statute book unimplemented <e>", "<cs> we have already covered a good deal of the ground in this amendment on amendments nos <e> <s> to which seems a long time ago <e> <s> but nonetheless we did <e> <s> as my noble friend lord bellwin and i have explained on various occasions during the course of the evening the water authority chairmen have agreed to establish a water authorities association <e> <s> the purposes of this association are to be as follows <e>", "<cs> whether this would be appropriate generally as in the case of my noble friend lord nugent of guildford who is absent at this late <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly do my best <e> <s> we very much appreciate the concern expressed by these amendments and i hope that your lordships will agree that what i have to say will allay at least some of that concern <e> <s> however i am afraid that the government cannot accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> its purpose is to secure continuity of employment for all national water council employees <e> <s> we believe and this is important that some considerable economies in staff and resources will be made by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords since may local authority manpower in great britain has decreased by some full time equivalents of per cent <e> <s> the value of the economies made by manpower reductions cannot be separately calculated <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that praise of the government but i should point out that there is currently a hiccup in the reductions and we like my noble friend are trying extremely hard to continue with these <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the governments intention and never has been to reduce the local authorities manpower to unpalatable levels <e> <s> as we heard just now the manpower reductions have occurred in education as regards lecturers teachers and administrators because of the falling school population as regards refuse collection through contracting out and also in construction and miscellaneous services affecting mainly the town hall staff <e> <s> i am advised that manpower is not homogeneous it ranges from the low-paid manuals through to chief executives although to the best of my knowledge and belief no chief executives have been made redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords not unpalatable <e>", "<cs> my lords not at this early hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that we went through that subject on the previous question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the house last week it is for authorities themselves to decide within the total resources available to them how much to spend on accommodation for the single homeless <e> <s> housing investment programme resources are distributed in a single block and housing subsidy is not related to specific projects <e> <s> broadly per cent <e> <s> of the annual loan charges on the cost of projects will be reckonable expenditure and count towards authorities subsidy entitlement <e> <s> in addition as part of its hostels initiatives the government have since given an allocation to the housing corporation specifically for hostel provision <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the noble baronesss last point first as i told the house last week negotiations on the future of the rowton hostels are still in progress <e> <s> another meeting is to take place within the purlieus of my department today <e> <s> i understand of course the continuing concern of noble lords on this subject but i am afraid that i am not in a position to say anything further at the moment in view of current discussions <e> <s> on the question of rehousing if the worst comes to the worst it would be a matter for each local authority to decide into which particular category the inhabitants fall whether they are vulnerable or not vulnerable <e> <s> if they are vulnerable there would be a duty on the local authority to find them accommodation <e> <s> if not they would receive advice and assistance to help find that accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that current inhabitants of hostels are necessarily in the vulnerable category <e> <s> they were almost certainly in the vulnerable category when they were originally housed there which is rather a different matter <e> <s> as regards whether camden can afford this exercise as i said last week and i am quite happy to repeat it now obviously the grant goes more to those areas which require it than those areas such as the shire counties which very often do not <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot add anything further to what i said last week <e> <s> i do not think that i referred to a statement <e> <s> i said that my right honourable friend was considering the position and would report which is slightly different from a statement in your lordships house or in another place <e> <s> as regards control orders yes the councils have the statutory power to use them if they so require <e> <s> i should not like to be drawn any further on discussions of this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a definitive answer on that but i should think that it is extremely unlikely <e> <s> i am the last person to want to pressurise people into doing what they do not want to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the government as again i said last week share the deep concern felt in all parts of your lordships house and indeed up and down the country <e> <s> as to whether the answers i have given will have caused great distress and great concern in camden particularly no my lords i was not aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the falkland islands government are currently assessing the demand for land ownership in relation to the amount being offered for sale on the open market <e> <s> first indications are that this demand is relatively small <e>", "<cs> my lords in the autumn the falkland islands government sent a questionnaire to workers in the agricultural sector asking whether and where they would like to buy land on the islands <e> <s> by the closing date th february only islanders had replied all expressing interest in acquiring land <e> <s> currently two schemes are in being <e> <s> one which is being offered by a private landlord is at douglas station secondly the falkland islands company is currently offering for sale -acre plots of land bordering the road from port stanley to darwin <e> <s> the falkland islands government themselves are considering the purchase of a three-farm estate in west falkland owned by packe brothers <e> <s> so this matter is not exactly being swept under the carpet and action is taking place on this front <e>", "<cs> yes my lords naturally i take the point that the noble lord has just made <e> <s> with all due respect to the noble lord lord shackleton it is one thing to put a concrete idea in a report but it is quite another subsequently to discover whether in fact the islanders want it <e> <s> however on the possibility of immigrants i shall certainly take that point and refer it to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords relative to what <e> <s> is probably the response to that <e> <s> in a recent television programme in this country the suggestion was made that per cent <e> <s> of the islanders want to buy land <e> <s> but the results of the questionnaire do not currently bear this out <e> <s> so again i ask the noble lord relative to what <e>", "<cs> my lords again relative to what <e> <s> i agree that acres for the production of sheep would be totally useless but acres for horticulture for pigs or chickens might be extremely valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble earl is perfectly correct on that <e> <s> i understand that the refers to households and the panorama figure of per cent <e> <s> refers to islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that anybody who wants to farm anywhere deserves all the help he can get <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to make clear in my original supplementary answers to the noble lord this question is being actively pursued both by the falkland islands council themselves and by my right honourable friends the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and the minister of state with special responsibility for that part of the world <e> <s> the fact that there are three farm schemes on the go at the moment while it is too early yet to see whether there will be any call for any more i think speaks for itself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am fully aware of recent parliamentary delegations to the falkland islands and i have a feeling that the noble lord himself was a member of one of them <e> <s> i readily admit that they have much more immediate grass-roots experience to use the noble lords expression than i have and most certainly i would be willing to take advice <e>", "<cs> my lords emigration and immigration are part of the general government policy and we want to keep it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords in great britain the estimated increase from the end of march to the end of was about million a rise from approximately per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the housing stock <e>", "<cs> yes my lords both have been increased dramatically in recent years <e> <s> it is estimated that between st april and st september last a total of public sector dwellings were sold in great britain <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures to which my noble friend referred in his initial supplementary question but i can tell him that private house-building starts have increased by per cent <e> <s> in each of the last two years <e> <s> the house builders federation expect a further rise of per cent <e> <s> in a cumulative rise since of over per cent <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot but i can say that there are now up to about right-to-buy sales <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to say so i think the noble viscount is half right <e> <s> while i agree that there must be houses available in the total housing stock in various areas to assist with mobility of labour i cannot necessarily agree that these should be part of the rented stock <e> <s> i think it would be a good thing that a man who has exercised the right to buy in one area and who because of the labour situation wishes to move should be able then to sell his house and move to a private house in another area of the country <e> <s> having said that it is a fact that a lot of voluntary sales have been made and were initiated in the year before the housing and building control act got on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct grants for improvement are a very important part of government housing policy <e> <s> i am afraid i have no current figures in that respect but i would say that the increase in the mortgage ceiling in the budget two days ago will naturally make quite a big improvement to these particular figures <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> that is a totally different question <e> <s> the reason why buildings are unoccupied is not necessarily because of government action or because of the action of people on the waiting list who want to buy them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made clear that grants are available for home improvement not only the per cent <e> <s> grant to which the noble baroness refers but in certain cases the discretionary grant from the local authorities <e> <s> each particular case has to be looked at on its merits <e> <s> if there are problems specifically connected with old-age pensioners and their particular housing needs in the private sector i will make certain i look at them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords now that the noble baroness has drawn that to my attention most certainly i will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with anything of the sort <e> <s> what i would agree with is that it gives a useful amount of money which is in part tax deductible for furthering private improvement schemes on the same houses <e>", "<cs> my lords while that is a slightly different question i was very interested to listen this morning to the bbc checkpoint programme on which this subject was aired <e> <s> i must say to my noble friend that given another five years of conservative government i have no doubt that this is one of the subjects that will be considered and looked at <e>", "<cs> order <e> <s> this is report stage my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i feel not for the first time as though i am answering an examination paper set by the noble lord lord flowers after having completed five years of tutorial on sub-committee g by the noble lord lord ashby <e> <s> however i am delighted to have this opportunity to respond for the government to the important points made by various noble lords about the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but they have if you like a decentralised approach from a central body which is already in existence <e> <s> what i am still not convinced about is whether we need a new central body as well as the alkali inspectorate <e>", "<cs> my lords a total of people from south africa made short-term visits to the united kingdom in under the british councils sponsorship <e> <s> the british council do not select their visitors on the basis of their ethnic origin <e> <s> statistics on this point are therefore not available <e>", "<cs> my lords while the council does not record this information in its records i would certainly imagine that most of the visitors were nonwhite <e> <s> the british council representative in south africa selects visitors on the basis of their specialised interests and the potential benefits they may derive from observing at first hand the work of institutions and organisations in britain corresponding to their own fields of interest and activities <e> <s> i rely on the second part of my original answer that ethnic considerations do not enter into this particular field <e>", "<cs> surely my lords if they kept records but i understand they do not <e>", "<cs> my lords they are given the opportunity and they are certainly not deprived of it in this country <e> <s> as i have said i think now twice in my answers this afternoon ethnic considerations one way or the other do not enter into it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly they did and the discoveries are as i have reported them this afternoon to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the propriety of the latter suggestion of the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> nonetheless i have no doubt that the british council take great note of everything referring to them which is said in this house or in another place <e> <s> if they do not see the particular <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> local authorities commonly incur expenditure on activities which go beyond their strict statutory obligations <e> <s> if my noble friend has in mind activities which lie outside statutory powers any expenditure on such activities would be a matter for the authoritys auditors and ultimately for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i can neither confirm nor deny that <e> <s> all i know is what i have read in the press and what i suspect my noble friend has read <e> <s> for good or ill the greater london council exists and it is within its rights to spend money in accordance with statutory powers on any local project which seems to it fit <e> <s> any dissatisfied voter has a remedy in his or her own hands at the ballot box <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been pointed out many times from the government dispatch box the government are not responsible for the questions on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i can advise my noble friend as to which specific person to go to but i have no doubt there is within the greater london council a publicity officer of some sort who would doubtless be absolutely delighted to give my noble friend the information that she requires <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins is perfectly correct <e> <s> this is why in my first supplementary answer i referred to the ballot box <e>", "<cs> my lords statisticians will tell the noble lord that comparisons are always dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord underhill will give way for a moment he has in fact neither moved the amendment nor withdrawn it in the current state of play because my noble friend has not answered <e> <s> if the noble lord wants an answer he will have to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bishopston spent almost the whole of his speech on the subject of the lddc whereas what the order is about and what i understood the debate would be about it is whether the lddc is an appropriate organisation to develop this site <e>", "<cs> i shall come to that shortly my lords <e> <s> to be fair i should add that later in his speech the noble lord made that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall obviously have to go to docklands <e>", "<cs> and take the noble lord with me <e>", "<cs> of the housing to which i was referring my lords i should be very surprised indeed to find that the reason why most were empty was that they were being redeveloped improved or whatever rather i think we should find they were empty because people were not prepared to live in them or they were unsafe to live in and they were not being improved <e> <s> however as i said i shall take the point the noble lord made firmly on board and go and look for myself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords water authorities will be able to comply with the provisions of the ec directive relating to the quality of water for human consumption by july <e> <s> certain derogations and delays are specifically permitted in the directive <e> <s> the secretary of state will not allow such derogations or delays where is is thought that public health might be endangered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her supplementary question <e> <s> as i said in my original answer derogations are allowed under article of the directive <e> <s> there is no doubt that in various quarters concern has been expressed over rising nitrate levels <e> <s> these are treatable at a cost and the medical evidence that we have at present does not lead us to believe that there is any cause for concern <e> <s> but naturally we are watching very carefully indeed the progress of research in this particular respect <e> <s> the use of nitrate fertilisers of course dramatically increases crop yields but as yet it has not been shown to be a matter for serious concern in relation to water sources <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend with his great knowledge of water is absolutely correct <e> <s> in the eec directive that we are discussing the maximum permissible nitrate level is i understand milligrammes per litre whereas the maximum recommended by the world health organisation <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer that supplementary question without notice my lords <e> <s> however i would say that this particular directive is aimed not at water channels but at water which is actually consumed by humans the so-called potable water <e>", "<cs> no my lords my attention was not drawn to the particular article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather another question but i would assume that it depends entirely on what nitrate levels have already been added to the soil as well as the type of soil structure that one is considering at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i am completely stumped by that supplementary question from the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall certainly make inquiries and report to her what i discover <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft mines and quarries valuation order which was laid before this house on th march be approved <e> <s> the purpose of the order is to do away with the special provisions for the valuation of tin lead and copper mines for rating purposes <e> <s> these provisions were conceded to the mines in to take account of differences in the basis of royalty payments on which rateable values are based between these and other mines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to lord bishopston for his reception of the order which will bring about a change to one small aspect of the rating system and will affect only a small area of south-west cornwall <e> <s> nowhere else will be affected <e> <s> nevertheless it is of considerable importance to the tin mining industry <e> <s> the prosperity of that industry will have repercussions on the economy and the employment prospects of that part of cornwall <e> <s> i am satisfied that the benefits of the order for the area as a whole will far outweigh the costs to the local authorities concerned <e> <s> it will i fear not be possible to provide accurate figures until the valuation officer has been to the mines and assessed their rateable values on the new basis <e> <s> however the total of the current rate bills of the four mines amounts to only just over the product of a penny rate in each of the three district councils after including the cornwall county council precept <e> <s> the mines will of course still have to pay rates although i would expect that the rates that they have to pay will be slightly smaller <e> <s> i can confidently say that the cost to ratepayers generally will be minimal <e>", "<cs> my lords home-grown vegetables form only a small proportion of the diet of the average consumer <e> <s> research has shown that even in areas where there are high natural levels of lead in soil and above-average consumption of home-grown produce the total intake of lead from food is well within the limit set by the world health organisation <e> <s> there are of course stringent regulations about the lead content of vegetables and other food offered for sale which accounts for the major part of the average diet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord lord wallace of coslany found my reply unsatisfactory <e> <s> the fact is of course that lead pollution of vegetables is by no means a proven factor and even if it were what is important is the amount that is actually consumed by the people eating the vegetables <e> <s> the evidence as a whole suggests that petrol lead the noble lord referred to motorways is not the main contributor to total intake in the united kingdom <e> <s> the results of the recent european community blood lead survey show that the united kingdom blood lead levels even in areas of heavy traffic are generally low and are virtually indistinguishable from those in areas with less heavy traffic <e> <s> in the very few cases where high blood lead levels were found the cause was invariably either exposure to lead in drinking water or careless stripping of old leaded paint <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government are far from dodging the issue <e> <s> my right honourable friend knows full well as do i of the forthcoming report of the royal commission on environmental pollution and as is always the case the government will study it with great care and attention <e> <s> the government know that on this particular subject on which at the moment there is much public concern as evidenced by the noble lords series of questions the royal commission report will add greatly to the debate on the topic <e> <s> i should be the last to deny the critical level shall i say <e> <s> of expertise contained in reports issuing from the royal commission but it might interest the noble lord to know that over and above that report the ministry of agriculture has in hand two research projects on the uptake of lead in vegetables from lead in the air <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble viscount is absolutely right <e> <s> in the washing and culinary preparation of vegetables there is achieved a substantial reduction of the deposited lead in any event <e> <s> it has been estimated to be as high as per cent <e> <s> though that is by no means proven <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have no answer to the noble lords supplementary question but what i do know is that the press release is concerned with long-term studies at the university of birmingham the institute of psychiatry the institute of child health at great ormond street and the university of southampton <e> <s> i should imagine that the studies have been going on for some considerable time <e> <s> i should think they were going on while the arrangements for the publication of the study to which the noble lord referred were also being worked out <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not yet clear whether the studies in other parts of the world especially in the south-western united states were in fact comparable in that the conditions were different there were different amounts of traffic and different amounts of air movement <e>", "<cs> my lords this is slightly dangerous territory <e> <s> first the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran thanks me personally and my advisers for meeting him although in fact i did not meet him and his advisers on that occasion <e> <s> then my noble friend lord nugent of guildford who is not now in the chamber praised me <e> <s> i must be most careful not to make myself unworthy of those two accolades especially after recent debates <e> <s> i in turn am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the most constructive attitude that he has taken over this matter and for the way that he has very generously not moved his amendment to the government amendment <e> <s> i fully appreciate what he has done and also i hope his reasons for it <e>", "<cs> my lords my scribbling is not quite keeping up with my thoughts <e> <s> i apologise to noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran my noble friend lord montgomery of alamein and the noble lord lord howie of troon have all supported this amendment <e> <s> with respect i think that they have supported it on a slightly false premise <e> <s> i can confirm that the governments amendment no <e> <s> establishes for the water authorities and for the benefit of both them and the private sector so far as exports go guidance which has statutory force <e> <s> once guidance guidelines or whatever it may be is put into an act of parliament it has all the force that all our acts of parliament have <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to correct a slight impression that i certainly received and i do not know whether other noble lords received <e> <s> when two amendments hang together that is to say a schedule amendment and a substantive amendment as in this case the noble lord either has to move amendment no <e> <s> in which case they would naturally go together or i am afraid he is not allowed to move amendment no <e> <s> after dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> that was exactly the position that i was attempting to explain which means that the noble lord will not be able to move his amendment no <e> <s> either immediately or after dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house that cannot be done <e> <s> the point is that the noble lord has moved amendment no <e> <s> and has spoken also to amendment no <e> <s> to which i spoke <e> <s> he then has to decide what course he is going to pursue with regard to amendment no <e> <s> and the balance as regards amendment no <e> <s> hangs on the course he chooses to pursue <e> <s> that is within standing orders <e>", "<cs> no my lords with the leave of the house that was not what i was saying <e> <s> i was saying that the noble lord has two possible courses of action <e> <s> he can either not withdraw amendment no <e> <s> in which case we will discover what happens to it or he can withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if he withdraws amendment no <e> <s> he will be unable to speak further to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no precise figures but it is estimated that well over million afghans have fled their country <e> <s> according to pakistan government sources there are about million refugees in pakistan alone <e> <s> there are large numbers in iran <e> <s> the total exodus represents about one fifth of the afghan population <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> the united nations high commission for refugees is taking a very active part in all this <e> <s> of the million in cash and food aid from this country to afghan refugees in pakistan a large slice has gone to the united nations high commission <e> <s> as to whether other countries would be prepared to take in refugees i would say that there are of course refugees both in america and in western europe <e> <s> as to whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> this problem has caused enormous pressure on pakistan <e> <s> this is one of the two reasons why we have given such large amounts of aid to help relieve the problem <e> <s> we consider that the european council proposals of th june for a two stage international conference on afghanistan continue to offer a viable and realistic framework for implementing a settlement such as that to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> before this can start we await the results of the indirect talks that have only just started between pakistan and the babrak karmal rgime currently taking place under united nations auspices in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords the european council statement of the nd of march emphasised the urgent need to achieve the withdrawal of foreign forces from lebanon and the resumption of negotiations aimed at a comprehensive settlement <e> <s> we and our partners in the ten are continuing to do all we can on the principles of the venice declaration to encourage movement towards compromise and negotiated solutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said before from the dispatch box that what we must see in this particular situation in the middle east is evenhandedness <e> <s> i reaffirm that today <e> <s> while not going quite so far as the noble lord in recognising that this is a potential world war situation i agree that we have commercial historical cultural and of course strategic links with that part of the world which is why we find it so important <e> <s> i am grateful for the noble lords acknowledgement of the efforts that the government have made especially culminating in the enormous strides that my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has made in the past few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is not for me to comment on whether the council of the palestinian liberation organisation is a minority <e> <s> however what i can say in regard to the latest breakdown is that king hussein and yassir arafat agreed on a joint document <e> <s> yassir arafat then went to consult with the plo executive committee for four days who would only agree what mr arafat and the king had previously agreed to with amendments which king hussein regarded as unacceptable <e> <s> yes i would take that as supporting my noble friends view <e>", "<cs> my lords i still believe in president reagans initiative in which he spelt out the final arrangements for self-determination for the palestinians in association with jordan <e> <s> i am also coming slowly to the view which the noble lord holds that there is a great dichotomy between the plo and the rest of the palestinian people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> i would not actually go so far as to say why and by whom the murder was committed but as i sought to make clear in my original supplementary answer to the noble lord lord molloy we cannot take any steps forward without the equal recognition of both sides to live in amity <e>", "<cs> no my lords with respect it is one of the two main obstacles <e>", "<cs> my lords while there is neither agreement between the outside states nor agreement within the arab states i do not think that a worldwide conference would be useful in the current circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords when i referred in my last supplementary answer to the disunity between the outside states and the inside states i of course did not refer to the equal apparent disunity the one with the other <e> <s> yes i very much take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that that would certainly be the next step and i look forward to the arab states consulting together and producing their own proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can go anything like so far as the noble lord did in his second and third supplementaries <e> <s> but i will point out that partial rejection is no reason for not pursuing a policy as all governments of all complexions have discovered over the decades <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into a committee and i believe it is right on this occasion to break the cardinal rule of public speaking never begin with an apology <e> <s> however having studied the <e>", "<cs> not for the first time in your lordships committee i have been feeling for the past few moments a little like a fish slice <e> <s> the noble lord lord hemingford who moved this amendment has returned as he and other noble lords have done and acknowledged including the noble lord lord ardwick prompted by my noble friend lady trumpington to the subject of publicity to be given to water authority meetings and discussions and the rights of the press and public in this context <e> <s> they returned to the subject though at a different part of the bill and this is vitally important <e>", "<cs> after such an opening as that how could i possibly resist <e> <s> as my noble friend lord sandford said in introducing the amendment the main purpose of it is quite clear <e> <s> it is to provide in legislation for the detail of consumer consultative arrangements which the bill leaves to the guidelines to be issued by the secretary of state <e> <s> i can understand concern that what is not in legislation might disappear without trace <e> <s> nevertheless we do not believe that there is any real need for this concern <e> <s> in order to <e>", "<cs> i was comparing the future with what is currently going on in the wessex water authority where there is a consumer sub-committee of the water authority <e> <s> i was comparing for my noble friend and indeed the wessex water authority themselves what would be the difference between what is going on now and what will be going on in the future <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that without slightly longer notice than i have just had i cannot tell my noble friend how many divisions are involved <e> <s> i can say as in the original guidelines divisions are the natural operating units of water authorities and normally there should be one consumer consultative committee for each division <e>", "<cs> in this connection i should like to emphasise the rigidity of the approach adopted by my noble friend in writing in the details of consumer arrangements as he proposes without any mechanism short of legislation to make any changes <e> <s> by contrast the governments position is one of total flexibility and openness to suggestion not merely from your lordships but also from those many interests outside <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett backs up his noble friend lady fisher on his own front bench which one would expect <e> <s> i am going to get to that point in a minute <e> <s> when i was talking about the government proposing to accept in principle my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> i was going on to say that i have some confidence that your lordships will accept in agreeing to do this that we are taking a significant step in the direction noble lords would like us to move <e>", "<cs> there should be separate arrangements under clause to appoint a committee at the regional level to bring together representatives of the water authority and the sporting recreational amenity and conservation interests in the area <e> <s> she <e>", "<cs> if i may deal with that specific point i had obviously totally misunderstood the noble baroness <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> in the event i shall have to reconsider which i obviously cannot do today what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> on the more general point she may be interested to know that we cannot yet consider the whole question but i have no doubt that it will be considered before any of us are very much older i can go that far <e> <s> this gives me the opportunity to say to my noble friend lord sandford something which i should have said on the first amendment <e> <s> it is that the report stage of this recommitted portion will take place as i understand it has almost been agreed between the usual channels and i have no reason to suspect that it will be anything different on tuesday of next week <e>", "<cs> the original guidelines will be re-issued in draft form with the amendments that i have been speaking about <e> <s> there will be one document to peruse and one will not have to go back and forth between the old and the new ones <e>", "<cs> this is the case in the water authorities themselves but it is not yet the case in the consultative committees <e> <s> paragraph of the guidelines says <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a little confusion about exactly what i am accepting in principle so perhaps i should say at the beginning that i am pleased to be able to reiterate my assurance to my noble friend that the government accept the principle underlying the amendment <e> <s> we believe there would be advantage in providing formally for the guidelines to be laid before parliament as his amendment proposes <e> <s> this underlines the statutory significance of the guidelines <e> <s> as i have already indicated we attach importance to doing this and i am grateful to my noble friend for providing us with this opportunity <e> <s> there are one or two minor points in the drafting of the amendment and its location within clause which we should like to improve <e> <s> i would therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment on my commitment to introduce a government amendment to the same effect on third reading <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> in that case no resolution is involved which i think is the point that the noble lord lord underhill was making <e> <s> but of course the point of having such act papers as they are called in the green minute is to advertise their existence to individual members of your lordships house <e> <s> it is then up to your lordships to call attention to them by way maybe of the recently much-maligned question for written answer a debate in your lordships house an unstarred question or whatever course whichever of your lordships who are involved considers appropriate at the time <e>", "<cs> yes but the point is that when it gets on to the <e>", "<cs> obviously there is an element of confusion about this whole matter <e> <s> in view of the lateness of the hour it might be appropriate if my noble friend and i together with other members of the committee who would like to be in on such a discussion could thrash this out afterwards <e> <s> i do not feel that there is a great deal between us but i believe that there is a certain amount of explaining to be done on both sides which would only take up the time of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble baroness was here when i made the point but i most firmly stated that the draft guidelines would be in the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what he will do on this amendment may i tell the noble baroness lady white that such papers are in the pink paper so there will be a double opportunity to be reminded of their existence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for giving me this opportunity to clarify our intentions towards conservation under clause <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord should consider my recent parliamentary answer to have caused concern i think those were his words over the matter <e> <s> when we debated this subject in committee the noble lord asked me for a categorical undertaking that the existing arrangements between the conservation bodies and the water authorities would continue <e> <s> these arrangements for consultation were referred to in the guidance notes issued last october on procedures under section of the water act as amended by section of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> i understand that in some cases arrangements bringing together the water authorities and the conservation organisations have existed for much longer than that <e> <s> in fact the noble lord himself has told me privately that in many cases this has been built up over a period of some years <e> <s> my understanding like that of the noble lord is that these arrangements are working well <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that more than schemes were submitted for this competition which was organised by rural voice at the invitation of my right honourable friend the former secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> that was certainly the rationale behind the decision of my right honourable friend to part finance this scheme <e> <s> the object was to take an existing project a stage further <e> <s> since counties have participated by running their own competitions to encourage self-help projects in villages in order to enhance the quality of life and to improve the viability of rural communities <e> <s> these projects have been very wide-ranging for example a volunteer-run community shop and the rebuilding of a village hall in gloucestershire a television relay station for an isolated community in cumbria a social club in north yorkshire and a community swimming pool in dorset <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has correctly identified rural voice which when preparing for this question i found difficult to do <e> <s> the substantive part of her supplementary question was to ask whether the prizes would not have been better in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the noble lord is correct <e> <s> although the present scheme has come to an end i understand that rural voice hopes to continue it and the development commission has agreed to provide further financial assistance in the same way that my department did that is to say on a pound for pound basis <e>", "<cs> my lords our ambassador has been in close contact with the mozambican authorities about this sad case <e> <s> the mozambican authorities are continuing their investigations but have not as yet been able to establish who was responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it our embassy in maputo is in contact with the mozambican authorities who are pursuing their investigations as to how why and by whom this dastardly act was committed <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord any more details than that <e>", "<cs> my lords if that were so i should agree with the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> but i would emphasise his word allegations <e> <s> nothing has so far been proved and it could very well turn out that there was another reason for this sad act <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of that although i have no doubt that the noble lords information is correct and this was a published fact <e> <s> however in the event i do not believe that any useful purpose would be served by setting up an inquiry in this country thus cutting across the official mozambique investigation <e> <s> and of course the reason for such an inquiry stems from events which took place in mozambique <e>", "<cs> my lords we can only protect british subjects when we know of their existence in other words in this particular case miss first was i am informed not registered at the embassy in maputo and nobody knew that she was in fact a british citizen <e> <s> contrary to what the noble lord has said miss first was born in south africa and she acquired british nationality not because she was in a gaol but when she was resident in the united kingdom in the s working among other things as a lecturer in sociology at durham <e> <s> as the noble lord says she was very deeply involved in south african liberation politics <e> <s> but i must repeat we do not know who was responsible for her death <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure about the propriety of making a statement at a later date but as regards the first part of the noble lords supplementary question most certainly i shall do that <e>", "<cs> no my lords she acquired british citizenship because she was here in this country working for a long enough period to fulfil that particular criterion <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is a totally different question <e>", "<cs> my lords with our partners in the five we are continuing efforts to achieve a settlement in accordance with security council resolution <e> <s> progress still depends on separate discussions on regional security issues which continue between the parties concerned <e> <s> we welcome the direct discussions taking place between the angolan and south african governments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course important to note that negotiations are continuing and that this can do nothing but good <e> <s> the americans and the angolans have met twice this year <e> <s> the south africans and the angolans met in late february <e> <s> it is unrealistic to expect rapid progress when the issues at stake touch on the vital interests of all concerned <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway referred to what is now known as linkage <e> <s> it is not part of her majestys governments position that an agreement on the withdrawal of cuban forces from angola is a precondition for a namibia settlement but we accept the political reality that an agreement on this issue is necessary for a settlement and would also contribute more widely to the stability of the region as a whole <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i accept much of what the noble lord lord hatch has just said <e> <s> however the american negotiators are well aware of the british governments position in all this and of course we are observers <e> <s> these bilateral talks are confidential to the parties concerned and we only know what has gone on in any particular set of negotiations when we are told about them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have no doubt that that is why our advice on the subject is frequently sought <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that that is rather wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are rumours of such things but we have no direct evidence that this in fact will happen <e> <s> we would not recognise the outcome of such elections if they were held and we would not regard such a development as affecting the prospects for an international settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i have to tell the noble lord lord brockway that this is something which is currently under consideration <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that there is anything inconsistent or strange about the supplementary answer that i gave to the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> bilateral negotiations are exactly what they say and no matter what rights a third party might have as a result of being a member of a group with one of the parties involved the third party knows only what it has been told about the discussions that have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords the falkland islands government have decided to buy a three farm estate on west falkland owned by packe bros <e> <s> this will be subdivided in due course <e> <s> they are now considering in detail the requirements of those falkland islanders who have expressed an interest in acquiring land <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree entirely that there is an urgent need for the government to consider a leak of a draft report which even the chairman of the committee involved said he has not yet seen <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the last time we discussed this matter the government believe that it is right to have a gradualist approach to land reformation and redistribution on the falkland islands <e> <s> so far as the non-falkland islands government estates are concerned and the offers of land which have been made by private people and private companies of course it is for prospective buyers to evaluate the particular scheme and to decide for themselves whether it is economically viable to take up the offers that have been made <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am grateful for that support for my supplementary answer <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various absentee landlords of which i believe the greatest is the falkland islands company <e>", "<cs> my lords no i did not see the panorama programme i believe it was to which the noble lord lord hatch referred which i understand was on th february <e> <s> however i have had details reported to me <e> <s> i am endeavouring to get hold of a script of the programme and of course will study it most closely <e> <s> regarding the land issue which was described in that programme it is my understanding that there are very few islanders as i said in my original answer only who have expressed an interest in buying land <e> <s> of course we now have to find out whether the finance is available and indeed what particular land each particular person of the wishes to buy <e> <s> it could be that they are all after three or four particular pieces of land on the falklands which of course would not help in the slightest <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pursuing this with great thoroughness otherwise there would have been no questionnaire sent out to islanders of which replied positively <e> <s> yes i most certainly recognise the correspondence to which the noble lord has just referred <e> <s> i think now i have had three letters and an annotated copy of an article from the gentlemen concerned and of course replies have been made to them <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i had heard that the falkland islands company was now a subsidiary of coalite <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his suggestion but as i was at pains to point out both today and the last time we discussed this question the falkland islands company is currently offering plots of land situated along the stanley to darwin road <e>", "<cs> my lords the falkland islands land ordnance gives the civil commissioner power to acquire compulsorily any land for a public purpose which includes any purpose and i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has rather run away with itself but i return to my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> with an offer like that how could i possibly refuse <e> <s> when we debated this matter the other day i made it clear that government objections to amendment no <e> <s> moved by my noble friend existed and exactly what they were <e> <s> my noble friend as he has explained has taken note of my objections as set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case one comment can be answered by another <e> <s> it is by no means clear that water meters save money <e> <s> it depends <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to consider that <e> <s> i can see that it might if i were going to accept this amendment but i am not <e> <s> i explained to your lordships on an earlier occasion that if you wished to have a debate when the guidelines were issued and laid before parliament it would be

very grateful to the house for the reception of this amendment <e> <s> most certainly the government will not publish final guidelines without the greatest possible measure of agreement <e> <s> that i can certainly confirm <e> <s> the noble baroness lady white was correct in saying that there are two different documents <e> <s> as i said on a previous occasion i will make arrangements for the draft guidelines before they are decided upon to be put in the printed paper office but i am afraid it will not be possible to have them covered by this amendment <e> <s> if that assurance will satisfy the

the house i ought to answer some of these very serious questions <e> <s> perhaps the house will permit me to begin by quoting from section of the local government act which set up the local ombudsmen

to amend the local government act so as to include the water authorities in order that they may come under the jurisdiction of the local ombudsman <e> <s> if i am wrong on that point i shall of course inform the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must make one point on this amendment which i have not made so far because <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to a stimulating debate <e> <s> it is a tribute to the excellence of the report that noble lords should have been moved to speak <e> <s> half of them i think i am right in saying are members of the select committee while one my noble friend lord nugent i think that i paraphrase him accurately said that he was semi-detached <e> <s> in this connection if the definition of an expert really is a drip under pressure then the last time we discussed this subject i was halfway there <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is pre-empting me a little on further remarks that i intend to make in my speech <e> <s> i shall return to that point a little later on if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i am about to say that they have <e> <s> the noble lord is also pre-empting me <e> <s> i shall reach that point later <e> <s> specifically on sewers as a result of the water research centres work water authorities are moving towards a strategy which concentrates upon those places where the risk of failure is high and the consequences of failure are greatest <e> <s> the strategy will take some time to develop fully as it depends upon the progress of survey work but that will not prevent water authorities from continuing to make repairs and renovate or renew sewers in the normal way as they have done in the past <e> <s> we shall be discussing their annual plans with them shortly and will be looking at this aspect of their plans particularly closely <e> <s> we shall urge a vigorous approach and we shall continue to seek to ensure that our public expenditure decisions make available sufficient external finance to enable the water authorities to carry out the investment that is needed and which can feasibly be implemented <e> <s> we shall encourage maximum use of private sector design and engineering contractors to ensure a satisfactory rate of progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the select committee report says that the water industry should pay attention to the case for broadening the expertise of water engineers with particular emphasis on process and systems engineering <e> <s> the department is currently seeking a view from the industry on this issue but will encourage the water industry to pay regard to the recommendation for itself and seek to maintain the appropriate education and training of chartered water engineers <e> <s> this general premise also covers the other points on training which were identified particularly by the noble lord himself and by the noble baroness lady white which are what i would define as junior training day release and so on <e> <s> the government intend to continue to press the water industry on this subject but of course it is for the water industry to identify their own needs <e>", "<cs> my lords provisional estimates show that dwellings were started in great britain in the three months from december to february <e> <s> house building starts in the months march to february were which is a per cent <e> <s> increase on the previous months <e>", "<cs> my lords my figures included february but my understanding is that the powers-that-be expect a per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> increase over and above the figures i have given in the next months <e>", "<cs> my lords in the figures were houses in houses in houses hardly the lowest on record <e>", "<cs> my lords my figures do not go back as far as or years ago <e> <s> what i can say is that the trend under the last government in respect of new house building starts was down between and and that from to as i have shown the trend has been up <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill may draw his own conclusions from that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as housing for the disabled is concerned we have to consider two points not only house building but also house conversion <e> <s> it is not therefore a matter of providing new specially designed accommodation <e> <s> more and more local authorities have been making provision for the needs of the disabled by adaptations to their own housing stock <e> <s> authorities are also increasingly making improvement grants available to disabled people wishing to adapt their houses <e> <s> i am glad to be able to tell your lordships that nearly five times as many adaptations and improvements were carried out last year as were made in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the breakdown which the noble lord requests <e> <s> with permission i shall write to the noble lord on this aspect but i take the point he has made <e>", "<cs> yes my lords housing starts are bound to vary greatly in different areas of the country <e> <s> this is because different areas of the country have different needs one has only to look at the rural as compared with the metropolitan areas and also because there is a political reason in particular places <e> <s> i am not trying to cast aspersions in any particular direction but i regret that that is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the annual figures but i do have the percentages <e> <s> the public sector starts were up per cent <e> <s> and the private sector starts were up per cent <e>", "<cs> the anti-climactic feeling referred to by the noble baroness lady seear in moving this amendment does not by the number of speeches we have had on it seem to have carried through <e> <s> the government are not out of sympathy <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that there are local authorities up and down the country who make the sort of arrangements with their tenants that the noble baroness has referred to <e> <s> but i must point out that it is for the local authority to manage its housing stock in its own way <e> <s> they are the funders the builders and the landlords <e> <s> the landlord and tenant argument applies to them just as much as in other circumstances it might apply to the private sector tenant and the private sector landlord <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher spoke about the right to buy as such comparing the right to buy and the circumstances surrounding that with the in a sense right to tenancy and the circumstances surrounding that <e> <s> i should have thought that the inquiry was not so much the right to buy as in the disablement of people not to have the right to buy <e>", "<cs> at the moment as i said just now where the tenant exercises or seeks to exercise his right to a mortgage he pays a fee of <e> <s> where the mortgage agreement is subsequently entered into that of course counts as part of the mortgage but this amendment applies to where it does not and ensures that the tenant has the mortgage option money refunded which i think the noble baroness will agree is the right course to pursue <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be useful if we could now consider amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it will then become clear why the government wish to delete the existing clause <e> <s> the first new clause in amendment no <e> <s> provides a limited but useful extension of the powers of local authorities and the housing corporations to guarantee repayment of mortgage loans <e> <s> the present powers in section of the act permit these authorities to idemnify only building societies <e> <s> since that provision was enacted a greater share of mortgage lending has been provided by other financial bodies particularly the banks <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i am in order but i shall of course respond to any questions on <e>", "<cs> it was with the long and rather complicated speech on the question to leave out clause <e>", "<cs> yes it is <e>", "<cs> the lines we are leaving out apply to the revamping of clause under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> those lines become unnecessary <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has got me totally at sea <e> <s> perhaps i could have a word with her afterwards if that is agreeable to the committee <e>", "<cs> i understand that it is also covered by amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the government fully appreciate the intention behind the new clause <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the attempt to resolve difficult and emotional family situations is readily understandable <e> <s> but the issues are complex and cannot simply be thought of within the context of public sector housing management <e> <s> after all public sector housing management is what schedule of the act is all about <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i can confirm that this matter is under constant consideration between officials of my department and the department of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> i shall most certainly take it away and think about it but i think it is only right that i should give my preliminary views on this block of amendments <e> <s> if these amendments are accepted the very real and positive right to repair which the government propose would be an illusion <e> <s> that is because the word agree is introduced by the first amendment <e> <s> if the landlord does not agree there is no <e>", "<cs> no i said that consultations are taking place with the representatives of the landlords not with the representatives of the tenants <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i will consider this whole matter so of course i will <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness and to my noble friend <e> <s> yes of course i will bring this within the ambit of my consideration <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness who moved this amendment in fact read the account in <e>", "<cs> of course i take the noble baronesss point on this <e> <s> what the noble baroness lady denington asked me was how the government envisaged this working <e> <s> that is slightly different from the consideration point and perhaps i may answer the noble baroness as to how we consider it is likely to work certainly at the moment before i have taken my own considered view of the operation <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is exactly right <e> <s> all this will be in regulations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both my noble friends for pointing out the difficulty and of course i will take up the opportunity afforded by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway to write about which proviso hangs on the other or whether neither does which i am not able to answer at this moment <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend lord renton and also slightly my noble friend lord campbell i must say that recognised bodies are far from being creatures of the secretary of state or the treasury <e> <s> your lordships will know that the mortgage market which is what this clause is all about is in a state of fluidity at the moment and it is not just the building societies which comprise it <e> <s> we envisage initially that the main mortgage lending institutions other than building societies would be specified in the order and would thus include for example banks insurance companies and friendly societies <e> <s> in five years time there might well be another financial institution offering mortgages in which case it would be appropriate to add it to the list by a future order <e> <s> this is why the middle part of subsection is drafted in this rather peculiar way <e>", "<cs> yes most certainly it is and i will do so <e>", "<cs> in the consideration which always goes on before writing a letter one of the points is consultation as to whether the clause needs redrafting in the way that my noble friend lord renton has suggested and of course i undertake to carry out this consultation <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is essentially a repeat of the existing clause of this bill <e> <s> the noble baroness has had plenty of opportunity to study clause <e> <s> if she wanted to register the kind of complaint she has just made she might have done so when we discussed clause the other evening which we did if my memory serves me right i do not have <e>", "<cs> clause will allow certain bodies to relax some of the requirements of building regulations that is those that are prescribed following consultation for their own works where they consider that that particular requirement would be unreasonable in the circumstances <e> <s> these bodies will be identical to the ones we have just discussed under clause namely local authorities county councils and prescribed public bodies which act under an enactment for public purposes and not for their own profit <e>", "<cs> everything that i said on the earlier amendments including the safeguards applies to this amendment <e> <s> our intention is that the bodies empowered to relax under clause should be the same as those which would be exempt from the <e>", "<cs> surely that is the point if they were responsible there would be no need to lay an order before parliament in order to take these particular self-certification powers away from them <e>", "<cs> despite the admirable way in which my noble friend has moved this enormous series of amendments i am afraid that it is going to take a little time to explain the answer <e> <s> at present the building regulations not only say what must be done <e> <s> in many cases they also say how it should be done <e> <s> the regulations contain a table six pages long listing the relevant british standards <e> <s> this is very useful for the builder but the inclusion of technical matter in such detail within the statutory instrument itself produces a very unwieldy document and it means that revisions or updatings of the standards concerned cannot be brought into the regulations without a further amending statutory instrument <e> <s> yet these standards have been developed in the british standards institution by committees of experts drawn from all relevant interests the professions manufacturers and contractors building owners and users local authorities and government departments <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure whether i have misled the noble viscount lord hanworth in what i said or whether perhaps he has slightly <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong of course i shall write and inform members of the committee who have spoken on this particular point but so far as i can see at the moment i am probably correct <e> <s> however if i am not as i say i will inform those of your lordships who are concerned <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble viscount <e> <s> i have not seen the letter to which he referred <e> <s> i do not know when he wrote it or when he sent it but if there has been a slip up in my department i can only apologise most sincerely <e> <s> i assure him that that is the position <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble viscount although trying to be helpful and with the best will in the world has confused me totally and completely <e> <s> i have checked with my officials and they have no knowledge even of receiving such a letter <e> <s> i hope that my reply will be a partial answer but obviously it will not be anything like as considered as it would have been had we been in different circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the problems of londons homeless and have under way a major programme for the provision of modern hostels funds are being made available specifically for this purpose through the housing corporation <e> <s> the future of the hostels in london owned by rowton hotels plc is primarily a matter between the company and the local authorities concerned the london boroughs of camden lambeth and tower hamlets and the greater london council <e> <s> an independent valuer has been appointed by those councils and the company jointly to determine the value of the hostels <e> <s> negotiations are at a delicate stage and i am sure the house would not wish me to prejudice them by saying more about the rowton hostels at this juncture <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> although i appreciate the concern on all sides of the house on the future of the rowton hostels i cannot agree that this is a national problem <e> <s> after all they are situated in local authorities areas <e> <s> local authorities have responsibility for the housing of people in special need <e> <s> the negotiations are being conducted between the local authorities concerned and rowton hotels plc <e> <s> so far as the governments estimate is concerned i am afraid that i have no figures on the number of people who will be sleeping out rough tonight but i have no doubt that the figure of people mentioned in the recent <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards empty houses this is again a matter for local authorities <e> <s> i have noticed that there are various places thoughout the country where local authorities are not using the money provided for them by government and through their own rating system for the occupation of those houses <e> <s> that is an absolute scandal when the money is available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the case that my noble friend brings to your lordships attention <e> <s> however if her facts are correct and i have no means of either proving or disproving them this is another scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made the point that the money is available <e> <s> as regards the report to which the noble lord lord soper refers this has been published only in the last few days <e> <s> the government are considering it very carefully and will report in due course <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and this puts them in a special category of homelessness for which local authorities are bound to find beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i made it clear in my original answer that as regards the rowton hostels anything is possible and i do not want to do anything which would prejudice the outcome of talks which are now going on <e> <s> as regards whether or not westminster council have vast amounts of empty properties i simply do not know the answer <e> <s> if they have there are normally very good and very valid reasons why some houses are vacant in other words when they are being repaired or rebuilt when there is a change of occupancy and other such reasons <e> <s> it is not all black on the housing scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mention the voluntary bodies in this connection <e> <s> i have already said that i have no estimates of homelessness in london in any of the various categories <e> <s> however to pad out my original answer to the noble baroness lady jeger in the housing corporation has made a specific allocation for association hostel housing and shared housing schemes of over million <e> <s> something like a third of this sum will be available for schemes in the london area <e> <s> under this government the housing corporation had up to the end of march approved schemes providing bed spaces over two-thirds of which are for single homeless people including the elderly <e> <s> the number of bed spaces approved in the last financial year was three times greater than in / <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition has put his finger squarely on the point which is that this is a growing problem in our great cities <e> <s> it does not apply only to london it also applies to birmingham manchester and to a lesser extent cities in the north-east of the country <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that young people particularly are not made aware which i feel that they should be through the school system that the streets of our great cities are not paved with gold <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect i think that that question is rather wide of the original question on the order paper even though i did widen my last answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord referring to empty houses generally or is he referring to the use of them by homeless people <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as employment and registering for unemployment goes i am afraid that i cannot answer my noble friend <e> <s> but i can tell her that since st april this year the rules for claiming benefits have been amended to make it clear that people resident for days or longer in such places are entitled to housing benefits <e> <s> it would be logical to assume that the same rules would apply to unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities should be very careful as to their attitude to this campaign <e> <s> it is quite wrong that political considerations of this kind should affect decisions on contracts <e> <s> authorities taking such a course would lay themselves open to action in the courts for acting unreasonably by taking into account irrelevant or improper considerations <e> <s> the government will keep in view the question whether the remedies available to firms that are discriminated against are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords that was rather a mouthful of supplementary questions <e> <s> perhaps i can best answer three of them by saying that in my view it is clearly wrong that local authorities should spend money on propaganda exercises which have nothing to do with the proper functions of local government <e> <s> local councillors should remember that they are elected to serve all the residents and ratepayers in their area and they have a responsibility to them for the proper stewardship of ratepayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to my noble friend i am not myself a court of law <e> <s> however i can confirm that court action could be taken by a firm affected by the decision or by a ratepayer or a councillor for the area if that were deemed to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that goes very much wider than the general terms of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i most readily undertake to inform the associations of local authorities as to the exchanges in your lordships house this morning but i must make the point that it would be quite inappropriate for the government to legislate because of a particular case <e> <s> it would be wrong also to rush into new legislation without evidence that the existing remedies failed to work <e>", "<cs> my lords no member of the supreme soviet of the ussr nor of the supreme soviet of the russian soviet federal socialist republic visited the united kingdom in the past year in his capacity as a deputy of either of these bodies <e> <s> however several soviet visitors to the united kingdom during the past months have been members of these institutions <e> <s> members of the ussr supreme soviet will visit the united kingdom later this month at the invitation of the great britain-ussr association <e>", "<cs> my lords i can of course confirm to my noble friend that there is no discrimination in any sense <e> <s> my noble friend rightly criticises the soviet union for refusing visas on general political grounds <e> <s> we would not wish to follow the soviet example by refusing a soviet applicant solely in retaliation for their prior refusal of a british applicant <e> <s> our practice is that visas are refused only when there is clear evidence that the individual concerned is personally unacceptable to us <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many things in heaven and earth that are remarkable <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that any visitor to this country would immediately recognise what the country as a whole feels about human rights <e> <s> as regards the other part of the noble lords supplementary question i do not think that the duties of a member of the supreme soviet can be compared with the duties of a british parliamentarian <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no closing of dialogue with the soviet union at ministerial level <e> <s> the house will be aware that my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary was in russia last week or possibly the week before and as i said in my original answer the great britain-ussr association has arranged for members of the ussr supreme soviet to visit the united kingdom later this month <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i have no information on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say that the boot is equally on the other foot for members of this parliament can pick and choose whom they see in the soviet republic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful and i am sure that the government and people of st kitts-nevis will be that three noble lords have felt sufficiently moved by this order to speak on it in your lordships house today <e> <s> i must however begin my reply with a general observation <e> <s> st kitts and nevis have had internal self-government since <e> <s> that is for over years <e> <s> in this time governments of two political persuasions have ruled both conscientiously and well <e> <s> that is not supposed to sound patronising <e> <s> it is something that i feel <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that clarification my lords <e> <s> when the constitutional conference was held the fact that both parties were there represented was an indication of this <e> <s> however in my book the real acceptance or perception of the acceptance came in the debate in the legislative assembly in march this year when both parties spoke and there was a vote at the end <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt gave me the impression that he had asked but since he has now confirmed that he did not i shall not answer <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of opinion which i do not particularly want to get drawn into at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords about local authorities throughout the united kingdom receive assistance under the governments urban programmes which are aimed at the alleviation of urban problems <e> <s> the bulk of the resources which stands at a record million for is concentrated in the districts designated under the inner urban areas act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in my book the function of government is first to identify the problem and secondly to do something about it <e> <s> this we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords the role of the multinational force in lebanon is to help the lebanese government and armed forces in the beirut area <e> <s> the present strength of the british contingent is men <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course a united nations force and the united nations commander is in control of the various contingents which include united states forces italian forces and french forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the role of our contingent is to patrol undesignated routes and to report any trouble it finds to the lebanese armed forces who will of course deal with it as appropriate it being in the lebanon <e> <s> as regards training i am afraid that i have no information for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the security council resolution number in front of me but as far as i am aware the facts that i have just given are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that there is an overall commander but i do not know of what nationality he is <e>", "<cs> my lords this contingent has been in beirut since th february <e> <s> the original request was for it to be deployed in the lebanon for three months <e> <s> in response to a recent request we agreed to extend this deployment by up to a further three months that is up to th august <e> <s> we have no plans to extend the deployment beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords from the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a great credit to this country and to our armed forces that we have been asked to participate in such a force <e> <s> of course we were delighted to do so in the same way as we were delighted to accede to the recent request from the lebanese government to extend this deployment for a further three months <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the british troops are serving under a non-british command <e> <s> i said that i thought it likely that there is an overall commander for the multinational force which is rather different <e> <s> but i can confirm that the men are from the queens dragoon guards <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think that i am confused but if i am naturally i shall apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to press the angolan government at the highest level on the early release of the prisoners and we shall maintain our efforts as a matter of high priority <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i cannot say whether a deal is in prospect <e> <s> if it is of course this would be confidential information <e> <s> so far as our pressure goes our ambassador last made representations direct to the president when he had his last private audience on th february <e> <s> but his normal channel of communication with the angolan government is through the minister of external relations to whom he has frequently put the case for the prisoners early

visit the prisoners monthly <e> <s> when they were last visited on th april the men were reported to be in reasonable health <e> <s> so far as the international red cross is concerned i regret that i have no information <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever our nationals have done abroad this government believe in making the greatest efforts not to endanger bilateral relations between two particular countries and i can certainly confirm that to the noble lord <e> <s> so far as his original question is concerned yes i can confirm that my right honourable friend when he met his opposite number in london recently raised the subject of these prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords on reading <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a serious matter <e> <s> no request to receive this waste has been made to the united kingdom government by the italian government or anyone else <e> <s> in principle it would be an unwelcome import <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully aware of the concern evidenced by the noble lord in his taking up the substance of an article which i must say at this stage appears to be a little speculative in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble baroness will know in this respect the control of pollution act operates under a system of licences and the government are convinced that this system of licences is adequate <e> <s> powers to ban or restrict imports exist but whether they would apply would depend upon the actual material its condition packaging and what was proposed to be done with it and indeed whether a licence was in force which would cover the particular chemical and the proposed action with regard to it <e>", "<cs> my lords any containers which could possibly contain this waste will be examined at all ports of entry into this country whoever may accompany them or drive them <e>", "<cs> my lords this is exactly the problem <e> <s> nobody knows what is to be done with it eventually because the transport of hazardous waste <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that although this is a hazardous poison it is necessarily a deadly one because as i have said before we do not know exactly what this waste is <e> <s> an international treaty covering the disposal or transport of such waste does not exist so far as i am aware but i certainly agree that this is likely to become a worldwide problem and should be dealt with on a worldwide scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> my information is that there are firms both in this country and on the continent which have the capability of neutrifying this very dangerous substance by using temperatures of enormous magnitude <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are greatly concerned at the residential properties which were reported on st april as having been empty for more than one year <e> <s> among many government initiatives the most recent is to ask councils in their housing investment programme returns for to indicate their specific intentions for bringing back into use dwellings empty for more than one year and the proposed expenditure if any involved <e>", "<cs> my lords in the hip returns to which i referred the regular quarterly up-date is to be found in your lordships library <e> <s> i regret to say that included among the figures is a list of what i can only describe as the good the bad and the ugly in this respect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i seem to remember describing this particular problem last week as a scandal <e> <s> certainly i would stick by that and so i am sure would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that is true at all <e> <s> the noble baroness says yes it is <e> <s> we shall get to that in a moment <e> <s> the figures to which i am referring and which i said were in your <e>", "<cs> my lords in the time available i am afraid that i have not been able to correlate the two sets of figures <e> <s> however if there is a very short waiting list in other words virtually instantaneous housing which my noble friend will know far better than i whether or not is a comparatively rare occurrence it would presuppose that the councils have no need for the buildings and therefore are perfectly entitled to sell them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of whole streets not very far from here one in particular which i am absolutely determined shall not become vacant in the near future <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> there was rather more laughter than i expected at that question <e> <s> therefore i did not get the full purport of it <e>", "<cs> alas not my lords <e> <s> it is a very serious table and it refers to the housing investment programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to report that the restoration of the ceiling of this chamber has continued to progress well in the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the second of my noble friends supplementary questions first no fibre glass has been used in the restoration work nor in any other part of the repairs to the ceiling which have been carried out almost entirely with original materials with the exception of some stainless steel hanging brackets <e> <s> because of course it is a hanging ceiling <e> <s> as to the number of staff i am afraid that i cannot tell my noble friend especially as a lot of the work has been carried out outside the building <e>", "<cs> my lords the interest of the noble lord lord shinwell although he was not in his place when the original accident occurred is of course very well known and very well appreciated <e> <s> i note that his hundredth birthday comes up at roughly the same time as when it should be possible to reveal the ceiling in its full glory <e>", "<cs> my lords a complete record is being kept as has been seen in the recent exhibition on the work on the ceiling <e> <s> i also understand that paintings are being carried out as appropriate from time to time by lady henderson <e>", "<cs> my lords the bosses are not yet refixed into place but it is considered appropriate that they should be bolted into place so that no such recurrence takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision has been taken on that but i agree with my noble friend that it may well be appropriate to retone certain parts of the chamber because otherwise the new ceiling will outshine the rest of this beautiful part of the building <e>", "<cs> my lords the building is still in a potentially dangerous condition but westminster city council have shored it up with temporary scaffolding <e> <s> the council have not served a repairs notice they arc awaiting detailed proposals from the government of iran for the reconstruction of the building <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that westminster city council should be commended on their prompt action in this matter <e> <s> a dangerous structure notice was served by the district surveyor after the unfortunate incidents in <e> <s> the iranian government chose to ignore it and so the city council went in and erected the scaffolding <e> <s> i understand although this is subject to confirmation that permission was neither sought nor obtained <e> <s> as regards my noble friends last supplementary question i am not sure that this would be the appropriate action to take as of course there is something of an analogous situation with british government property in iran at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that on the face of it this might be regarded as an ultimate sanction <e> <s> of course the section notice could require the iranians to carry out basic minimum repairs or alternatively a section notice could require more extensive repairs <e> <s> but in that event the only sanction would be compulsory purchase <e> <s> but given the vulnerability of our diplomatic compound in tehran to which i have already referred the sensitivity of diplomatic relations and the united kingdoms counter-claim of damage to the tehran embassy <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a hypothetical question <e> <s> there is no dramatic need for action to render the building safe or anything else until it becomes distinctly unsafe which as i said in my original answer has not yet occurred <e> <s> however i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> if it were not a diplomatic immunity situation there would be recourse to the courts but regretfully that avenue is not open to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as i remember i answered a question at some length on the kensington town hall within the past three months or so and i refer the noble baroness to the answers i gave then <e>", "<cs> my lords for shorthold tenancies in greater london a fair rent must be registered by the rent officer within days of the tenancy being granted <e> <s> for shortholds outside greater london which began after st december this initial registration of a fair rent is not compulsory <e> <s> instead the rent may be freely agreed between landlord and tenant although either party may apply at any time to the rent officer for a fair rent to be fixed <e> <s> we have no plans at present to change these arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this subject is part of a whole range of opportunities which were freed by the housing act and indeed it has made a good start with some registrations that we know about but i feel that with a little bit of political uncertainty since and the labour partys pledge to repeal this activity it could hardly have been expected up to now to have had a mammoth impact on the private rented sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend that the rent acts generally from onwards have contributed to the structured decline of the private rented sector <e> <s> but i do not think that that is the only reason for the decline because as we know there is a confessed wish of a majority of people to live not in rented accommodation at all but in owner occupation <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various sorts of tenancies available in what i might loosely describe but not i hasten to say in any legal way as controlled tenancies <e> <s> there is also of course the open-ended private rented sector both in london and outside in the provinces <e>", "<cs> my lords i have recently been down to the docklands where the policy of her majestys government is being carried through to the letter <e> <s> there buildings are available to let at reasonable rents and low cost home ownership schemes are being pursued with the utmost vigour <e> <s> in other parts of london properties would be rented first if landlords were assured that they would get fairness and secondly if prospective tenants could afford to pay the rent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally different question but i make the general point that thoughts are thoughts and i should not like to put any limit on them <e>", "<cs> my lords this has never been implemented but i shall certainly take up my noble friends suggestion with my honourable friend the minister for housing and construction <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for housing as in anything else is for a mix both socially and businesswise and indeed in any other way <e> <s> i think it is right and proper that both ends of the price spectrum should be present in a particular area of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords if a person owned a house rent would not come into it <e> <s> i believe that after a certain period it is possible to receive rate relief on an empty property but i shall have to write to the noble lord with the details <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are anxious to ensure that all leisure centres are managed in the most efficient way including the use of private sector expertise where appropriate <e> <s> the sports <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the third part of my noble friends supplementary question is concerned <e> <s> i have no information on the eec grant but i shall write to him <e> <s> i should like to make the general point that sport is important to the whole community and local authorities must continue to play a major part in the provision of local leisure facilities <e> <s> however having said that i hope that all local authorities will look at their facilities carefully and will always ensure that they are managed efficiently <e> <s> this may mean opening such centres for rather longer hours than they would normally wish to do it may mean attracting grants for refurbishment for example from the sports council or it may mean doing the same thing with a mix of private enterprise and other parts of the public sector for example longer use of sports facilities in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the district auditors report a document which is still not completed let alone published <e> <s> on my noble friends second point yes certainly if he would like to put down a question for written answer i should be delighted to answer it as fully as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is rather a different question because leisure centres entail buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble viscount for a moment i would point out that i think he is in danger of breaching the <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the information is not readily available in the terms requested but i can inform the house that between april and march the proceeds from sales of government new town and water authority land amounted to million <e> <s> as to the second part of my noble friends question the information for england is to be found in the registers of unused and under-used land published under the local government planning and land act <e> <s> these contain nearly sites covering about acres including land surplus to requirements <e> <s> six similar registers are being compiled for wales <e> <s> the provisions do not extend to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords an analysis of a sample of registers suggests that about one-sixth of the total is specifically suitable for house-building <e> <s> this means sites and recurring acres <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first instance the owners of the land decide requirements <e> <s> it could be that there are very valid reasons for land being under-used or totally unused for example buffer zones round mental hospitals or prisons or rather wide embankments along railway lines <e> <s> in the second instance should my right honourable friend the secretary of state decide that these reasons are not valid he has the power to direct disposal but only after first informing the owner that he intends so to do <e>", "<cs> no my lords i regret that i have not <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> this was so up to june but that scheme was abandoned in favour of the current scheme which we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords planning restrictions obviously apply to the use of this land <e> <s> it is just the fact that it is unused or under-used which is currently concerning my department <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect it is normal for the minister to answer the first speeches from the opposition front benches before other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness she is absolutely correct <e> <s> i was getting confused with the statements which we dealt with earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a steady and welcome improvement <e> <s> the latest statistics for january-march this year show per cent <e> <s> of planning applications in england being determined in eight weeks as against per cent <e> <s> three years ago <e> <s> this represents a considerable and sustained effort by most planning authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not differentiated quite as much as no doubt my noble friend would wish but i can tell her that during the period to which i referred in my original answer for housing generally decisions were made in england and of those were on householder developments and on developments of new dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble baroness that the only good decision is the right decision <e> <s> but i would take issue with her on the subject of speed because i believe that that has to do with efficiency rather than quality <e> <s> the credibility of the planning system depends on good decisions being reached quickly <e> <s> slow decisions are neither better nor worse <e>", "<cs> my lords yes as far as i know there is a full complement of inspectors but as i am sure the noble lord also knows more and more appeals are being referred to inspectors <e> <s> the department has introduced a system to help speed up planning appeals <e> <s> in particular we have issued a circular upon the subject <e> <s> we have streamlined the internal procedures and we have introduced a computer to assist in the managment of case work and the collection of statistics <e> <s> but we are by no means satisfied with the situation and i do not think that this is a subject upon which one can ever be satisfied until every planning authority turns up per cent <e> <s> i do not see that happening not within my lifetime anyway <e> <s> but i should like to assure the house that we are continuing to do everything we can to process these appeals speedily <e>", "<cs> my lords the tiers of government do not always affect the matter <e> <s> for example i notice that in the isles of scilly in the last six months they have improved from per cent <e> <s> of applications settled within eight weeks to per cent <e> <s> i do not think that that has anything at all to do with tiers of government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i absolutely agree with the noble baroness and of course this is one of the points that was in the circular to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i will give the house that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> in my reply to my noble friends first supplementary question i said that the categories were not as well defined as she or i would like <e> <s> but i have no reason to suppose that planning applications in these particular cases should take longer to deal with <e> <s> if my noble friend or indeed any member of your lordships house has any specific case to which they would like to bring my attention i shall of course be delighted to take it up <e>", "<cs> my lords the royal commission on environmental pollution thinks that it should be possible for unleaded petrol to be introduced for new cars throughout the european community by <e> <s> this target date seems a reasonable one to aim at although we shall try to improve on it if possible <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it has been an excellent one <e> <s> further to my original answer our object is to secure the introduction of unleaded petrol as soon as is practicable <e> <s> but i should point out to the house that from the end of petrol will contain a smaller amount of lead per cent <e> <s> less that it does at present <e> <s> we are intent upon removing the remainder as a matter of general prudence <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the last point we are certainly doing everything we can <e> <s> we had a very successful environment ministers council in june this year and discussions are continuing on this <e> <s> i hope to be able to publish the discussions if not the results of the discussions by christmas <e> <s> some united kingdom refineries can produce limited amounts of high octane unleaded petrol but the oil industry as a whole would need quite a long time and considerable additional investment before that could be generally available <e> <s> the present generation of cars also need lead as an engine lubricant <e> <s> finally we must have a european agreement on octane ratings so unfortunately there is no easy overnight solution <e> <s> but i reiterate what i said earlier we shall if at all possible bring the target date forward but of course with agreement <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as i understand it germany has not made a unilateral declaration but has announced an intention which is rather different <e> <s> on the more general point the car industry in this country is part of a europe-wide car industry and therefore it would be totally counter-productive for a small proportion of the cars which are bought in this country to run on unleaded petrol whereas the great majority which come in from other eec countries would still have to run on leaded petrol <e> <s> this is why we say that we need agreement in the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords whoever is answering from this bench will i am sure be able to give the noble lord an accurate and responsible reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i do know that the dust-lead route as it is called is still in some doubt as to what exactly is the effect of lead in dust <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to repeat advice that i think i gave to the house some three or four months ago all vegetables and fruit whether from high-lead areas or not should as a matter of course be washed before they are consumed and also in the case of leaf vegetables the outer leaves should he removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go quite so far as that this afternoon but i would say that from our studies of the available medical evidence the government feel that at the very least the medical evidence is equivocal <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the comments on cost benefit methodology of the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley i do not think that this is a subject to go into at great length at this stage of the bill and if i may i will reserve my position and write to the noble lord <e> <s> so far as the inter <e>", "<cs> my lords by the end of september this year moves had been reported as having taken place under arrangements operating within london and other moves under the scheme had been reported by the same date <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> this on the whole voluntary scheme was set up in order to facilitate moves of especially council house tenants and it was set up both for social reasons and for job purposes <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that in the year per cent <e> <s> of the households who moved between councils in different counties that is the national level of the scheme did so for job reasons <e> <s> the equivalent figure for was a little over per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to introduce a bill to confer leasing powers on the crown in respect of the fine rooms and other parts of somerset house with a view to their use for artistic cultural or other purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords and to the noble baroness who have spoken today <e> <s> i must say that it was an exciting opportunity for me to hear the maiden speech of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton from the <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was trying to point out in answer to the second part of the noble lords intervention was that all these things are being looked at and nothing can be regarded as sacrosanct <e> <s> that is as far as i was going at that moment <e> <s> as far as the first part of his intervention goes he has forgotten what i might call the opportunity cost which is that if the application finally goes through and is a partially-charged-for application there will be some saving in time <e> <s> this will be balanced to some extent although i take the noble lords point that it may well be that we have not got it right by the fact that a preliminary investigation causes the potential applicant not to apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some embarrassment at the end of this debate not because of what the noble lord lord george-brown has just said but because two hours ago or thereabouts i made a speech in your lordships house in which i said that the principle was not at issue <e> <s> we were talking about details <e> <s> here with the greatest respect it is the other way round and i hope that i do not get myself too muddled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that what i am about to say might sound patronising <e> <s> it is not intended to be but taking risks is by virtue of it part of my job <e> <s> to say that the report that we are discussing is the most thorough and understandable report to come from your lordships select committee for a long time is no overstatement <e> <s> i am encouraged in this belief by the remarks of noble lords during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the world governing body of football fifa has asked national football associations to bid for the world cup <e> <s> it is understood that england greece italy and the ussr are in the running and it is for the english football association to pursue with fifa its bid to host the world cup <e> <s> fifa regulations determine that the finals must be held in one member country and therefore the term great britain is inappropriate as the tournament cannot be staged in more than one of the home countries <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> indeed the world cup the finals of which were played here gave english soccer a great boost <e> <s> i should remind the house that we won that competition as well as hosting it <e> <s> of course this boost would come to all the various industries involved including tourism <e> <s> but i should point out to <e>", "<cs> my lords regretfully speaking as a member of the government i can only say that the full force of the law will he brought to bear upon them if they misbehave but i am afraid i cannot give the assurance sought much as i should like to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i quite agree <e> <s> but i think i am right in saying that so far as the world cup was concerned these guarantees were given after the successful application to fifa <e> <s> this is exactly what we intend to follow should our application be successful in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered the noble lord lord graham on the point that he raised and i have said that should we be successful i do not see any difficulty on the governments side in giving guarantees on matters like transportation immigration and security <e> <s> in my original answer i pointed out that it is for one of the home countries to apply in which case it is either england scotland or wales i am told there is also a national body representing football in northern ireland <e> <s> nevertheless obviously all true fans are always welcome at football matches wherever they are held <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> the real problem is not that the grounds are not there not that the very excellent teams are not there not that transportation is not there but that there is a mammoth crowd control problem in this country <e> <s> there is no problem with reputable fans but it is with what i might describe as the outsiders who very often do not even bother to go to matches themselves <e> <s> they are the ones who cause the problem and cause us all concern <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally different question but of course we regularly take great interest in the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is a slightly different question but as i have been at pains to stress throughout my answers this afternoon we are absolutely determined that where law breaking occurs the law breakers should face the full panoply of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence at present that woodlands in the united kingdom are being adversely affected by acid deposition but the government are keeping a close watch on the situation <e> <s> there is regular monitoring of the health and growth of many tree species by the forestry commission <e> <s> the potential effects of acid deposition on woodlands are being investigated in a number of government funded research projects by the forestry commission the natural environment research council and the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord taylor for the topicality of his question <e> <s> i have not seen the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in the south west of scotland the prevailing winds are westerly but it is not necessarily the wind-borne deposition that is in question it is quite possible that the rain could come from the united states or wherever <e> <s> the important point is that it is not the direct rainfall that is in question but the effect of the rainfall on the soil <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the forestry commission are already undertaking a study of this matter <e> <s> when it is completed they will of course inform the department and i have no doubt that there will be an opportunity to report the results of that study to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord from the opposition front bench <e> <s> of course we must keep the matter in perspective <e> <s> one of the interesting facts that i have come to learn in studying this question is that although the united kingdom emissions of sulphur dioxide have fallen by about per cent <e> <s> since no corresponding reduction has been observed in the acidity of rainfall <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last point raised in the noble ladys supplementary i of course agree that it is impossible to identify which particular countrys acid is in the deposition that affects a particular area of the country <e> <s> but as i said a short time ago there is no evidence that acid rain <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the factors of acid rain is that it is particularly damaging in certain geological areas where the soil is already acid in other words it will make more acid <e> <s> however if the acid rain falls for example on the south downs the natural alkalinity of the soil will neutralise the effect of the rain <e> <s> so it is particularly serious in those parts of the country which my noble friend knows so well <e> <s> i am well aware that in these particular sensitive areas it has led to fish losses <e> <s> it is one thing to establish the fact that it has happened it is quite another thing to estabish how best to deal with it <e> <s> i am advised that liming for example which to my laymans mind would seem to be the logical answer in fact does not work <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that would be appropriate <e> <s> perhaps aluminium rain from your lordships ceiling might have a more devastating effect <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> if i have been complacent in my answers today i can only apologise <e> <s> i was at pains but perhaps i failed to point out that the government do view this matter with great seriousness and have asked for a report which is partially government-funded from the warren springs laboratory <e> <s> moreover we are of course fully committed to working with other signatories in the united nations economic commission for europe convention on long-range trans-boundary air pollution in tackling this problem <e> <s> but as i said earlier it is one thing to identify the problem and to get the exact scientific reasons for it it is regretfully quite another thing then to decide on further scientific evidence on how you cope with the problem <e> <s> this of course will also have to be studied <e> <s> preliminary studies are already taking place towards this end <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps just to prove that i have been listening to my noble friend lord teviot i should say my cushions i am most grateful to my noble friend for raising this question this evening <e> <s> it touches on a subject which i know to be of great concern to this house and to many outside <e> <s> energy and environment issues invariably arouse strong interest even passion not least among your lordships <e> <s> i must in this connection restrain my natural impulse to blow a kiss across the dispatch box in welcoming the noble baroness lady nicol to the opposition front bench <e> <s> i am delighted to see her in her new position and to welcome her as environment co-spokesman on the front bench opposite <e> <s> i have no doubt that she will bring a lightness of touch which is on occasion so needed in countryside matters <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness was here when we had the wide-ranging and informative debate earlier this year on the future of the commission on energy and environment but i can tell her that tonights debate has definitely been in that tradition <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i had proved my point <e> <s> i certainly was not going to read any more from my list <e> <s> in all those applications i have not noticed the enormous public or local outcry which has been occasioned by the particular application perhaps i might better call it a series of applications as we are now

noble friend before he leaves the chamber is prepared to correct me <e> <s> is there not a quotation from the old testament which goes along the lines <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not in the bill for the simple reason that the word lease is not in the bill in the context of what we are discussing <e> <s> not for the first time the noble baroness has pre-empted me <e> <s> i was about to answer her question <e>", "<cs> the lease is only at the heads of agreement stage <e> <s> discussions are still taking place <e> <s> if the courtauld institute agree with the noble baroness that or years is not

thursday that provision for housing investment by local authorities in england in will be million <e> <s> authorities were also <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all local authorities have to identify the need which it is my understanding they have not yet done <e> <s> specifically the noble lords question refers to prefabricated reinforced concrete houses <e> <s> as authorities have not yet assessed the need for early expenditure or indeed exactly discovered how great is the problem in their particular area it is at the earliest a matter for rather than for <e> <s> so far as the reduction in the hip is concerned there is quite a lot of unallocated expenditure from previous years in the system <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that one should not look at the direct government grant but the total amount available for spending to local authorities which brings the figure up to billion <e>", "<cs> my lords if a house a building or whatever is unsafe to live in and cannot be reasonably repaired then obviously the only course is to demolish it <e> <s> however on the more general point the needs for repair were borne in mind throughout our discussions of the provision which should be made for housing public expenditure <e> <s> but the problem should not be exaggerated either in scale or by suggesting that defects which will not arise for many years must be dealt with immediately at the cost of vast sums of money <e>", "<cs> my lords on the quality of housing stock generally i have no doubt that we shall discuss this matter at great length on wednesday when we debate the motion of the noble baronesss noble friend lord pitt <e> <s> but so far as the non-traditional houses are concerned the government are looking at the totality of the money that local authorities have to spend for this coming year as i understand it without whatever the noble lord lord dean of beswick may say the full determination of the scale of the problem <e> <s> there is enough money to cope with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords before i could answer that question i should be extremely interested to know first how many accumulated capital receipts there are in the leeds housing budget and secondly how many council houses they have sold recently <e>", "<cs> after those generous gestures all round the committee this might be an appropriate moment for us to adjourn for dinner and for me to resume the house <e> <s> i should tell the committee that it has been agreed through the usual channels that we shall not return to this committee stage until at least pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the topic which the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has chosen for <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have given the impression of being snide i would say that that was certainly not my intention at least not quite at that point in my speech <e> <s> but as i understand it in the past when the right-to-buy legislation was first promoted the labour opposition were dead set against it as a concept whereas now i believe they are perhaps breaking ranks is the wrong expression coming to an acceptance that there is a logic to it and quite a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords right so we have got that straight <e> <s> i still do not think i agree with it but nonetheless <e>", "<cs> well my lords perhaps there is a lot in the housing field that we should all come round to and over which we should start to accommodate each other <e> <s> i was talking about the increase in owner-occupation <e> <s> there is no doubt that this trend reflects a deep-seated preference on the part of the people <e> <s> it also has important implications for the repair and maintenance of the stock the primary responsibility for which rests increasingly on the owner-occupier <e> <s> if home-ownership is one great aspiration there has also been a steady social pressure for improvements in the standard of housing <e>", "<cs> my lords how can it be <e> <s> there is certainly a growing problem of disrepair and i will try in a few moments to describe how the government propose to tackle it but first i want to put into proportion the contribution which the public sector makes towards maintaining the private sector stock <e> <s> with respect i do not seem to be doing very well at the moment because there seems to be constant barracking and opposition though in view of the subject perhaps i should say i am not surprised <e>", "<cs> my lords the national trust have indicated that they would require approximately million to provide a capital fund and an endowment if they were to take on calke abbey <e> <s> the government would be willing in principle to accept calke abbey together with its contents and essential adjoining land in lieu of tax at a cost of about million <e> <s> however they could not agree in addition to provide the million or so requested by the national trust whether directly or through the acceptance of other non-heritage property offered in lieu of tax by the trustees of the estate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is some years now since hardwick was accepted by the government <e> <s> in that case the noble lord is quite right non-heritage land was involved <e> <s> but since that time the history of our care as a nation of heritage properties has moved on and we have the national heritage memorial fund which was created as a body to provide support for important heritage causes together with much improved fiscal arrangements since this government came into office <e> <s> i must be the first to congratulate them because they are doing a magnificent job but i should point out that the fund is an independent body and there is no guarantee that the trustees even if they had the money would come to the conclusion that this was the right way to spend it <e> <s> neither the government nor anybody else in the house could put that obligation upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most unfair charge <e> <s> the parliamentary under-secretary in charge of these matters has been in constant touch both through officials and on his own behalf with the harpur-crewe trustees <e> <s> he and they have constructively explored every avenue that has been put to us but the avenues that have been put to us have been made on the assumption that the government will continue to fund these heritage estates out of their own pocket though many other people and indeed your lordships who have great expertise in this matter have managed through their own efforts with government help to make provision for their estates <e> <s> i cannot see any good reason why that should not happen in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords all sorts of things might persuade them that they had had enough and as i have said the government are fully open to all reasonable approaches <e> <s> so far as the goes that is an estimate but it is a statutory duty of the inland revenue to recover unpaid tax and so long as the tax is unpaid there is no way of varying this interest charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the sand and gravel of the goodwins is crown property managed by the crown estate commissioners who can grant licences to dredge it <e> <s> licence applications are very carefully scrutinised to ensure that there would be no significant adverse effects on other interests <e> <s> licences are not granted if dredging would increase the risk of coast erosion <e> <s> local fishing interests have been consulted about investigations into the effects of dredging on the goodwins <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with all of the points made by my noble friend especially on the historical importance of the goodwins <e> <s> however i should tell the house that in the current application only per cent <e> <s> of the goodwins is likely to be extracted <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend knows the goodwins are formed by a continuing process so that it will not be very many years before that per cent <e> <s> is replaced <e>", "<cs> my lords regretfully although i am all for using colliery spoil the ncb have advised that it would not be suitable in this particular case for the east docks extension of the dover docks <e> <s> as far as both coast erosion and fisheries are concerned the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i have said the goodwins are in state of flux and they will continue to be so as long as we have those particular tidal movements in that particular

departments involved that is to say the department of agriculture and in this case the minister of agriculture and the local planning authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords they were consulted and as i understand it having been consulted they were unable to show that there would be a substantial reduction in the crabs or the sole which were indigenous or in other fish on the goodwins <e> <s> equally

only the land but also the hospitals themselves which are being sold as a unit and i cannot see any objection to that in cases where the hospitals are no longer required for their original purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said i think on two previous occasions that i am not sure of the correctness of the answer i gave to the noble lord lord wallace <e> <s> i said that if i was wrong i would write to him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i confirm that in producing the bill and introducing it into another place we acted with some speed once the problem had been identified <e> <s> i should

<e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that would certainly be a way of doing it <e> <s> perhaps if i can have private discussions with the noble lord lord wallace afterwards we can come to a suitable arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most useful and informative discussion of a practice which is almost as old as mankind hut which in our modern communities is now a subject of considerable technical complexity <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships would wish to join me in congratulating my noble friend lord cranbrook and his colleagues on the subcommittee which produced the report on their work not forgetting that admirable servant of all such committees their clerk <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is addressing a question to my noble friend before he sits down

happen <e> <s> quite honestly i am not in a position to answer that at the moment but i should have thought it was perfectly proper for a secretary of state as he does all the time to announce such a decision to parliament by means of written answer <e> <s> i will certainly investigate that possibility <e>", "<cs> i do not think i am supposed to refer to that but the noble baroness i am sure knows perfectly well how the secretary of state would deal with such a situation <e>", "<cs> for once i am well briefed on this amendment <e> <s> i am very well aware of the roles which both members of the committee played in this very lengthy but absorbing subject over a considerable period of years <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness spoke eloquently at second reading about the need for a longer lease to the university of london of the north block of somerset house for use by the courtauld institute <e> <s> the answer i gave at the time and i do not want to repeat it now bore almost immediate fruit <e> <s> a letter came whistling into the department from the university of london taking up my suggestion that if they wanted it we could of course have discussions about the matter <e> <s> i confirm that readily this evening <e> <s> but it should be remembered when considering leases for parts of somerset house that we are dealing with a building that is already old <e> <s> it cannot be considered in the same light as say the hamptons site to which the noble baroness referred where a lease of years has been agreed but for the erection of a new building <e> <s> that is quite a different kettle of fish from somerset house which as we all know is a building that is already venerable <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> yes years is in mind but i cannot say at this point in time what will be actually incorporated in the lease <e> <s> one thing we cannot do across the dispatch box is to negotiate a lease which is still only at heads of agreement stage <e>", "<cs> i believe there is a noel coward song in which there is the line <e>", "<cs> there was a sting in the tail of that remark <e> <s> the noble baroness refers to desirability <e> <s> what is desirable at the present time in other words concerning the lease that we are discussing or rather that we are trying hard not to discuss but have ended up discussing may very well not be desirable in or years time <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows full well this is an enabling bill <e> <s> i remind her that on another bill we discussed recently she became fairly irate practically thumped the dispatch box it was certainly in her mind even if the action did not flow from her hand and said my lords we are discussing the bill that is before us tonight <e> <s> noble lords will remember that that was the bill of my noble friend lord vaizey <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement on sellafield being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for recognising both the serious informative purpose of this statement and also for recognising that it is an interim one and that i or my noble friend will be reporting to the house at a later date <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart asked when that later date would be <e> <s> obviously it cannot be until after the report to which i referred has been received by ministers but as the statement makes clear the intention is to publish it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord mean unique in this country or unique worldwide <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the drift of the noble lords question <e> <s> is he asking whether there are any other incidents from other plants situated in this country or situated anywhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> no it is totally unique to sellafield <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> he must chalk it up to my inexperience in these matters <e> <s> so far as possible prosecutions are involved while they are in the domain however loosely of the director of public prosecutions he will understand that i am unable to give him very full details <e> <s> the plant is allowed to discharge low-level radioactive discharges to the sea under authorisation from the department of the environment <e> <s> as the statement says these should be as low as is reasonably achievable which seems to be unlikely i would not put it higher than that as a result of this particular incident <e>", "<cs> my lords unless a particular part of it pertains to possible prosecutions yes the report will appear in full when it is published <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sorry <e> <s> my understanding is that the department of health and social security are proposing to issue special advice to doctors in cumbria <e> <s> if people are in any doubt that they might have been in contact with any of the flotsam or seaweed their local doctor would be the first person to contact <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly give further consideration to that point <e> <s> i referred earlier to parental responsibility and parents can read press notices <e> <s> the advice is widely circulated in the area <e> <s> fortunately at this time of the year

their parents neighbours or guardians or whoever could be tempted to use the beaches for example for recreation at this time of year <e> <s> further i am advised that british nuclear fuels limited are in touch with local communities <e> <s> they are playing their part responsibly in circulating the information that i have given to the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for giving me the opportunity to expand on my necessarily brief answer to the recent starred question in the name of the noble lord lord kennet on the future of calke abbey <e> <s> in spite of the terms of the question i am answering now there is no doubt but that this is primarily a matter for my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> it does not have nearly the treasury implications that the terms of the noble lords question would imply <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i misheard <e> <s> we can look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord houghton for the spirit in which he has moved the first of his five amendments <e> <s> i readily appreciate that he has softened his approach and although he might feel that some of my answers this evening are rather negative i hope he will feel that i am also rather less abrasive tonight than i was on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i most certainly agree with the thoughts uttered in committee on the civil service rifles war memorial in that this is an artistic monument in its own right <e> <s> it was designed by lutyens and erected in <e> <s> however it is but one feature of somerset house and its courtyard <e> <s> in committee i said that it was entirely fitting for this memorial to be sited there and that there had been no intention of moving it <e> <s> i assured your lordships that the governments whole aim was to preserve somerset house in its entirety and that it did not seem appropriate therefore to single out this or any other feature for special mention in the bill <e> <s> that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the minister will be able to give the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby something that will reassure him on this point <e> <s> in committee the noble lord explained that his amendment which would require a statutory instrument was designed to alert parliament to any intention which the secretary of state might have to grant a lease of any part of somerset house <e> <s> i thought then that he accepted my explanation that a statutory instrument was an inappropriate way of securing that objective <e> <s> indeed i received an intimation of that same feeling this <e>", "<cs> my lords as both amendments nos <e> <s> and reflect the long title i had <e>", "<cs> my lords the title of the bill reflects its contents and the contents of the bill before you make no reference to educational purposes or similar purposes to the artistic or cultural ones <e> <s> nor does the noble lord lord houghton suggest that the body of the bill be amended in such a way <e> <s> therefore my general point on the two amendments is that they are defective <e> <s> but even without this i should not like them very much <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hoped by easter to issue a revised schedule to the dangerous wild animals act <e> <s> the schedule already includes all the old world monkeys and consultations with leading animal experts are nearing completion on the inclusion of other primates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the concern of the public and interested members of the zoo world the pet world and of course the rspca in all these matters <e> <s> however i am afraid it is still premature to say that any particular monkey will or will not be licensed <e> <s> my own feeling at the moment is that it is not appropriate to license all primates irrespectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to confirm that to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there are primates and most reverend primates and i agree that the two should not be confused <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in response to speculation in the media over a so-called radiation leak at the national physical laboratory i shall repeat a statement now being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state at the department of trade and industry <e> <s> the statement is as follows

between the time when these events were discovered on th december and today <e> <s> the answer is quite emphatically no <e> <s> on th december all staff individually and contractors working on the site were notified that the building would be closed as aprecautionary measure until further notice and were told the reasons for that <e> <s> notices were also posted within the building <e> <s> the health and safety executive was also informed as was the national radiological protection board <e> <s> articles appeared in the local press on th and th january and questions were answered by a national physical laboratory spokesman <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> her majestys government speak with one voice at all times <e> <s> on this occasion and on this subject i am it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i sounded over-harsh that is something the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce and i and possibly my noble friend the leader of the house will have discussions about outside in attempting to give answers and explanations to some of the points made by the noble lord lord bruce then of course i shall be the first to apologise <e> <s> however he asked me to justify my use of the word speculation and i believe i have done that to the best of my ability <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a short bill which deals with the application of certain aspects of town and country planning legislation to crown land <e> <s> like all planning legislation it is necessarily complicated <e> <s> at first sight it may seem to be a technical and somewhat obscure byway of the planning system <e> <s> but in fact the bill is of considerable practical importance and is urgently needed as the speed with which it has passed through another place demonstrates <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a helpful and constructive debate which has confirmed that there is a great deal of common ground on this subject <e> <s> obviously there is a measure of detail and i still have quite a lot of explaining to do <e> <s> i hope to have the opportunity to do this this evening and again at any subsequent stages of the bill for which noble lords may call <e> <s> in this connection perhaps i should say at the moment that i shall look particularly carefully at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point but i do not think that it is right for me to go into any further detail <e> <s> i will write to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords planning legislation of this particular complexity and technicality is not written for the ordinary man in the street <e> <s> it is written for the legal advisers of local authorities the legal advisers in this case of health authorities

i would answer not without notice <e> <s> the point is that i have not had sufficient notice and i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> this is a short bill and has received ample consideration by your lordships <e> <s> although it appears before the house today completely unamended numerous amendments have been debated during earlier stages and two important developments have occurred <e> <s> first as the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords reasonable was also in the words that i was investigating <e> <s> in any event i have tried very hard to meet this point and i hope that the noble baroness will accept that <e> <s> i also pay tribute to my noble friend lord mancroft and to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for their detailed work on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the housing act made special grant available for providing means of escape from fire and made the grant mandatory if work is necessary for compliance with a relevant local authority notice <e> <s> these provisions have been in operation since <e> <s> in addition the government made an order under schedule to the housing act in respect of means of escape from fire from houses in multiple occupation and are currently reviewing the scope of that order <e> <s> we also hope to be able to publish a code of guidance on fire safety in houses in multiple occupation this year after consultation with all the relevant interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern of the noble lord about the hazards of fire especially in houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> but the normal mechanism for dealing with hazards from fire is the fire precautions act which is currently under review and i would hope that one of my noble friends will be able to announce the results of the review before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stallard has raised two points <e> <s> on the second point i would say that since the noble lord introduced his bill and the second bill came under the consideration of another place both local authority associations and the government have looked at the proposal and have come to the conclusion that it would be too <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already commented on the question of fires and have given an assurance that the matter will be reported to the house as soon as may be <e> <s> with regard to the occupants of houses in multiple occupation yes my lords by definition they must be some of the most disadvantaged members of society <e> <s> so far as the structure of a building goes local authorities already have very wide powers <e> <s> the question at issue is whether they should be compulsory powers or whether these wide powers should be left to the discretion of the local authorities themselves to use as appropriate <e> <s> the governments view is that the latter course is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take the point on board and of course pass it to my right honourable friend <e> <s> but the answers that i have given so far make me rather doubt that the outcome will be quite as the noble lord would wish <e>", "<cs> if the committee would forgive me it is normal practice not to break into discussions of this nature until an appropriate moment when the subject has been cleared up which quite self-evidently has not yet occurred <e> <s> thus we will not be breaking for the statement until after we resolve whether or not the clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will now agree that this is an appropriate moment to go on to the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton but would also say that even where there are anxieties in only one mind and not the tens dozens hundreds or even the unnecessarily high as i think thousands that have been quoted in certain quarters not by the noble lord i know if we can allay that one anxiety we will have done a good job this evening <e>", "<cs> after that very sorry news we return to the discussion of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton with his customary courtesy advised us that he would like to speak to the entire series of his amendments <e> <s> i had not quite anticipated that but i shall certainly respond in the same manner <e> <s> i hope that by the time i have finished i shall have been able to give the noble lord a comprehensive review of the amendments <e>", "<cs> after that necessarily lengthy exchange i would say that there are two minds with but a single thought <e> <s> the noble lord asked me particularly whether good valid reasons my phrase would always be given to the local planning authority <e> <s> the answer is emphatically yes <e> <s> as far as his point relating to enforcement action is concerned the answer would also always be yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject which the noble baroness has chosen for debate today is important and rightly one of public concern <e> <s> i have listened with interest to the points which have been made <e> <s> as has been pointed out the debate is also most timely <e> <s> inevitably large numbers of persons large amounts of money and percentages have and will be referred to in this context <e> <s> but the debate today is about people <e> <s> it is as well to remember that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments advice in the code of guidance is that such accommodation should be used as a last resort <e> <s> not only is it expensive but as we have heard this afternoon it is very unsuitable for families especially those including young or even older children although it can be useful in meeting a short-term emergency <e> <s> money can often be much better spent in making empty council accommodation habitable <e> <s> better still improved housing management can often reduce the number of empty properties <e> <s> it can prevent them being vandalised and incurring still greater cost <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point yes of course it is a management problem and not a political one <e> <s> there are councils up and down the country of any or no political persuasion who are at fault there are equally councils up and down the country of any or no political persuasion who perform in the governments view and i think the noble lords view very well in this respect <e> <s> it is not a political argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the implied criticism of the noble lord lord rhodes but manchester is neither a province nor a country <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly i will <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a complicated case in two unlinked parts <e> <s> the current permission granted by kerrier district council in july is for caravans and/or tents from april to october each year whereas the permission on the adjacent field on which compensation has been paid was for the permanent siting of holiday chalets <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has no power to hold an inquiry into this or any other planning permission granted by a local planning authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i would first take issue with the noble lord that revocation was a waste of public money <e> <s> in fact whenever revocation or as in this case cancellation of planning permission is concerned compensation is always payable <e> <s> that is what happened in this case <e> <s> so far as planning permission in the adjacent field for tents and/or caravans is concerned this went to public inquiry an inspector was appointed and the report went along the lines that the councils opinion was validated within certain parameters which particularly pertained to access to the site and access to the beach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the interest of the noble lord lord bullock in this matter and i have in front of me a copy of a letter to my right honourable friend from him and also my right honourable friends reply <e> <s> i too understand that the site lies in an area of outstanding natural beauty but again it is for the kerrier district council to take this into account <e> <s> they are the responsible elected authority and are perfectly capable of weighing the issues involved <e> <s> so far as i can see in this case they did exactly that <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the compensation was paid for the chalet development not proceeding and the council obtained a signed agreement with the owners that this should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer my right honourable friend has no powers to instigate an inquiry into this case <e> <s> there has been a call particularly from the noble lord lord bullock for a new hearing but my right honourable friend feels that it is only in the most exceptional circumstances where an authoritys decision appears to be so grossly wrong as to damage the wider public interest that he would be prepared to exercise his default powers of revocation <e> <s> it does not appear to him that in this case there is any call for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see the relevance of that to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea <e> <s> that is a matter for the developer <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as scrutiny goes the papers have been in front of me for weeks and i have been examining them as time permitted for a considerable period of time <e> <s> as far as the validity of the current application <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i concur with the view of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement on the sellafield discharges which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for responding to the statement that i have just made on behalf of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i would take up one point which the noble lord lord beaumont has just made about informing the public <e> <s> at the first available opportunity after this incident occurred my right honourable friend reported to another place in the form of a statement and that statement was repeated here by my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> since then we have had the interim statement of st december and todays statement <e> <s> at all times the government have been prompt and honest in their reporting to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said my information as i stand here this afternoon is that they are not under-staffed or under-resourced <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord stoddart about the seriousness of this matter <e> <s> however what we have to ask ourselves is would it have happened had the nii possessed more resources both of staff and of cash <e> <s> my understanding is that it still would have happened <e> <s> therefore i do not blame the monitoring of the nii in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady lockwood on a most interesting and enlightening debate <e> <s> if it has done nothing else it has made me examine critically a report which <e> <s> i must admit under normal circumstances i should have looked at somewhat cursorily <e> <s> however it came as no surprise to me that most noble lords could not resist the temptation to comment on the governments own proposals for changes in metropolitan government <e> <s> i shall return to those in a moment <e> <s> in the meantime i am most grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for the measured way in which he put his or perhaps the alliances could it be that they coincide <e> <s> views <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must not quote me out of context <e> <s> i said that there is no logic in having two tiers in the metropolitan areas <e> <s> there is plenty of logic behind retaining the county system in non-metropolitan areas but that is not what the debate is about <e> <s> so we approach this question from a rather different point of view <e> <s> having a reasonable size for the basic unit of government in urban areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has somewhat confused me <e> <s> does he mean then that democracy only works when you win <e>", "<cs> my lords as joint boards are comprised of councillors who themselves have been directly elected as we have already established this must be democracy in action <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot take the point of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> that is a fair question my lords <e> <s> the government do not have the costings and they will not be able to produce the costings until we see exactly what levels of employment and redistribution of staff will be involved between for example the metropolitan councils and the joint boards <e> <s> there are also of course specialist staff who by the very nature of things will have to be transferred to the boroughs <e> <s> until we know about that there is absolutely no hope of making a definitive calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend to press ahead without the delay of an inquiry but of course this house will have a full opportunity to debate the major legislation that will be needed and i look forward to constructive discussions on the details of our proposals when the details are formulated <e> <s> this is not an appropriate stage to consider at length the detail of our proposals lady fishers trading standards department and so on but i assure her the point will be looked at carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be better to give a composite answer to all the points raised both here and elsewhere on the future of local services but if the noble baroness would like me to write to her specifically i shall be glad to oblige <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recently published report is that of the review group on acid deposition in the united kingdom copies of which have been placed in the library <e> <s> a number of other scientific reports are expected in the next few months including that of the royal societys discussion meeting last autumn on the ecological effects of deposited sulphur and nitrogen compounds <e> <s> the government plan to expand further their research on acid deposition <e>", "<cs> my lords to use a rather unparliamentary expression i can confirm that the government will not hang about on this matter <e> <s> however i should say that the scientific links between sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide have not yet been proved to be the cause of the devastating effects that we are seeing in some

scientific evidence so far being unclear <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there is certainly sympathy <e> <s> this year we spent million on research into the effects and linkage of acid deposition <e> <s> i confirm that next year it will be considerably more but i do not yet have the figures available <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will know that since there has been a per cent <e> <s> reduction in the amount of sulphur dioxide put into the atmosphere <e> <s> regrettably this has not resulted in a reduction in the effects of so-called acid rain <e> <s> it is unclear exactly what is the cause <e> <s> therefore it would be premature to fix such things as scrubbers to our big factory chimneys which would be very expensive and which as far as we can see at the moment would not necessarily have the desired effect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware that the scandinavian countries have undertaken research but they are no nearer a solution than we are in this country <e> <s> i have already told the house that we plan an increase in funding for research and that we take this matter extremely seriously <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have read papers from various sources giving a different series of views <e> <s> this is exactly the problem <e>", "<cs> absolutely none my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat the answer that i gave the noble lord in response to his first supplementary question <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of that and i am very grateful to my noble friend for the information <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously not my night i have obviously made such a hash of explaining this amendment that the noble lord lord graham did not really get the drift of what i was trying to say <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is that it enables a tree preservation order to be made when the land is still crown land <e> <s> it is a sort of subliminal interest if you like <e> <s> it only takes effect as soon as the land is sold or the private interest is created <e> <s> the new owner or lessor may very naturally want to object and he has this six months which the noble lord asked about in which to do that <e> <s> after that time the order would be confirmed or not depending upon whether his objection is upheld <e> <s> i hope that now explains the position to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in fact the chopper comes down even more quickly than that <e> <s> the moment the transfer is signed between the crown and the purchaser at that very moment the tree preservation order comes into effect <e> <s> so there is absolutely no gap at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until a quarter to eight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has made clear in this bill his interest concern and goodwill for the allotments movement in this country <e> <s> indeed how could it not be so <e> <s> he is the distinguished president of the association of allotment gardeners <e> <s> i too welcome this opportunity to reaffirm the governments support for the thousands of allotment gardeners in england and wales <e> <s> as my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary wrote in this quarters edition of <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that it is for the simple reason that if the noble lord is referring to the current housing benefits scheme or something of that ilk it was widely canvassed among the local authorities before it was adopted and a decision that they should take it over as a type of agency function was reached <e> <s> so i do not think that there is anything at all inconsistent in what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing yet to add to paragraph of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that a future strategy will have to be arrived at <e> <s> but as i have said on numerous occasions this will not be done until after we have studied the responses to the consultation paper <e> <s> were rate-capping of individual boroughs to become necessary i am advised that it would not affect the problem to which the noble baroness is addressing herself <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e> <s> we decided that this was the right way to go about matters but we recognised in this case as the white paper makes clear that there is concern in the voluntary sector about the possible effects of abolition <e> <s> therefore it was considered wise to issue the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly but again my views on breakfast accommodation are well-known <e> <s> the same money would be far better spent on rehabilitating the long-term empty housing stock <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept the noble lords premise at all because any cross-boundary arrangements that are come to will have to be come to by the individual boroughs which are themselves elected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord lord shinwell should feel that way <e> <s> when i wound up for the government in that particular debate i explained that we were in the middle of a consultation period the formal written consultation period having finished on st january but that naturally because of the concern expressed in your lordships house i would include the various points made as part of the consultation procedure <e> <s> this is exactly what is going on at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be most surprised if they are not <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords again i thought that i had made that patently clear on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there is uncertainty but i do not accept that there is urgency <e> <s> the funding is currently going on and there is no reason whatsoever to suppose that the borough councils themselves cannot replace it <e>

homeless which is not provided by conventional means <e> <s> we are not talking about deprivation of the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are satisfied that the licence granted to anglo-austrian automatics ltd for the import of three killer whales was in accordance with the washington convention <e> <s> it was granted for educational and scientific purposes including exhibition and breeding <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the last point in my noble friends supplementary question is concerned the answer is yes <e> <s> when it was received the <e>", "<cs> my lords the question has not yet been put <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider that the experience of voluntary bodies can play an important part in the development of national housing policies and welcome their views on such matters <e> <s> we also accept that they can make a valuable contribution at a local level <e> <s> in the latter case however it is for local authorities to decide how far to consult and involve them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no monopoly of good ideas and they recognise this <e> <s> there will inevitably be gaps in the statutory and local provision for housing which with its experience the voluntary sector is very successful at plugging <e> <s> some schemes have been taken over by the public sector in the past and i have no doubt that others will be in the future <e> <s> whether they will be concerned with homelessness or with short-life use is difficult to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the government are putting difficulties in the way of local authorities in the manner that the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> we are changing the particular body which provides a particular fund to a particular voluntary sector housing association <e> <s> in answer to the noble baronesss second point we have today a long debate on the subject of housing the second of three allocated days and i have no doubt that we shall be able to pursue this aspect a good deal further <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we were discussing voluntary bodies which are partly funded by public moneys <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships fall into that category <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady denington has obviously read and understood the governments proposals <e> <s> however if only to clear my own mind i think it would be appropriate to run through them briefly to put this series of amendments in context <e> <s> i must however in doing so make it clear that today we are discussing not the regulations that may subsequently be made they will be laid before parliament and be subject to negative resolution to answer my noble friend lord campbell but clause itself <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws her amendment i most certainly undertake to have conversations with her whenever and wherever she desires <e> <s> as to whether the amendments were meant to have the effect that i have identified i am prepared to believe the noble baroness of course that they were not meant to have this effect but i am advised that that is the effect they in fact have <e> <s> this is the point <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that my noble friend lady vickers has had consultation and correspondence with the environmental health officers on this matter <e> <s> i should like to say at the outset how well those particular council officers do their job but i should like to point out to my noble friend that they are of course council officers and it may well not be appropriate for one particular group of council officers with their particular expertise to do this job <e> <s> in many cases what you actually need is an administrator rather than a specialist <e> <s> i think that we are still in danger of misunderstanding the kinds of repairs to which the proposed scheme is addressed <e> <s> the right to repair which this amendment again would seriously affect is designed to enable tenants to carry out their own repairs and to receive payment from their landlords when they have done so <e> <s> as i have said earlier the details have yet to be finally worked out but when they are worked out draft regulations will be issued for further comment <e>", "<cs> what i meant by an administrator is someone who is not a highly-trained specialist such as the environmental health officer to whom the amendment refers <e> <s> it is somebody who is adept if this is the problem in interpreting the forms for the applicants to use <e>", "<cs> while i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> lord evans of claughton about the mass municipal schemes to which he referred when moving his amendment schemes which were erected in the s and s for the conditions which were thought to be in existence at that time i have to say to him that the country has moved on since then <e> <s> as a result of current knowledge and experience we now know that those schemes were misconceived <e> <s> none the less it is easy to be wise after the event <e> <s> i am the first to accept that the noble lord lord evans of claughton has the germ of a good idea which i should be willing to talk to him about <e> <s> however as the noble lord will appreciate there are problems about consulting in advance of the original letting because we do not know which members of the housing list will be put into the scheme that has been built <e> <s> with that proviso if the noble lord is speaking about a scheme which is currently occupied and which will be changed for one reason or another i should be very interested to talk to him about it <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to be dilatory <e>", "<cs> some minutes ago the noble lord lord evans of claughton was at it again not jumping to his feet but being too radical <e> <s> i welcome the importance given in the amendment to tenants management co-operatives but the entitlement that it proposes cuts across the voluntary principle on which they simply must be established <e> <s> in any eventuality i cannot support coercion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord evans has referred to the discussion in another place on giving tenants access to files about themselves and their homes <e> <s> the government then undertook to see how secure tenants could be given the information they want and i of course understand the noble lords anxiety to find out what progress has been made <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both my noble friends <e> <s> i think the key to all this is in what the noble lord <e> <s> lord evans of claughton said <e> <s> he said something to the effect that it was his desire to give the maximum opportunity to people to learn about the things which affect them <e> <s> we have now heard six different speeches on six different points which is why i suggest to the committee that consultation is a very real and necessary thing in all this <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will consider this an appropriate moment to break for supper and to go on to other business <e> <s> i see the opposition chief whip looking at me and i suggest that we do not return to this current business until twenty minutes past eight oclock if that is convenient to the committee <e>", "<cs> i think i can help the committee <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was spoken to by the noble baroness lady birk with amendment no <e> <s> as was amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i had hoped before the noble viscount lord hanworth spoke that i should be able to respond to the amendment as briefly as the noble baroness lady nicol moved it <e> <s> i am afraid that that <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> this is untrue <e> <s> the approved inspector is responsible for the work up to the point where the disagreement arises <e> <s> if the disagreement has not been put right then either the local authority or the first approved inspector or the second approved inspector would have the authority to get it put right for the development to continue beyond that point <e> <s> i do not think it is an impossible situation <e> <s> the original approved inspector would be totally liable in law for all the interim certificates given for the work up to that point <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the whole objective of the system is to break down into sections the building work on the development and a certificate must be issued at the end of the last section before the next section can be undertaken by the developer so that we have this safeguard built into the scheme all the way along <e> <s> if there is a row and a default on one side or the other the inspectors certificates up to that point not only remain in force because he will have been satisfied otherwise he would not have signed the certificates but as i have said he will be liable in law should his work subsequently prove to be defective or negligent <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble lord lord irving of dartford can possibly be right <e> <s> the complaints that i have received are not that the inspector will he too tough but that in carrying out his duties he will be too lax <e>", "<cs> it is surely in his own interests not to be too tough so far as the builder is concerned <e> <s> as the noble lord says he will want to get another job on another development <e> <s> it has been suggested to me that he will be too lax from the point of view of the local authority in which case the local authority will get to know very quickly and the next time round will refuse him an initial notice <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that collusion would result in negligence which is an offence under a later clause of the bill to which i cannot turn at the moment <e> <s> since this is obviously a very complicated issue for the noble viscount perhaps we might with advantage discuss it outside in the near future <e>", "<cs> oh dear my lords the privatisation of building control <e> <s> i really cannot agree with that <e> <s> it has got nothing to do with it <e> <s> what it does is give an option which is not available at the moment to a developer and why on earth should he not have such an option <e> <s> the noble lord also talked about a scandal <e> <s> may i remind him that the lead time for nuclear power stations is in the order of from to years <e> <s> i equally cannot accept his definition of a scandal in this case <e> <s> we are working concurrently on consultation papers with the production of a bill and all governments have done it at all times and will continue to do it at all times in the future <e> <s> there is nothing improper in that <e> <s> but i would accept one thing that the noble lord lord graham has said this is a key issue <e> <s> i feel sure that both sides of the committee agree that some form of insurance is necessary to protect the owner of a certified building in the event of defects occurring at a later stage which result from an approved inspectors negligence <e> <s> let us remember that this is what we are talking about we are talking about negligence and not some other reason for a building falling down a collapsed wall a collapsed roof or whatever <e> <s> it is the inspectors negligence that we are talking about <e> <s> such cases should be rare just as they are under the present local authority system <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the noble lord cannot have it both ways <e> <s> he suggests on the one hand that the local authority panel of inspectors is doing so well that the developer would not take up the option and then he suggests on the other hand that when the developer does take up the option there is the threat of i was going to say dismissals but that is the wrong word <e>", "<cs> yes the threat of redundancies in the local authority team <e> <s> those two ideas are totally incompatible <e>", "<cs> may we first dispose of my may letter <e> <s> it surprised me that it was produced in evidence and waved before my face <e> <s> however they have an expression of the west coast of scotland which i am sure the noble baroness knows which is we think better later <e> <s> i may have been intelligent then but my thoughts and those of my respondents have clarified as a result of consultation <e> <s> i should say that there is yet more to come before we achieve total purity <e>", "<cs> in answer to those two questions to are being consulted at the moment but not all of them will be approved <e> <s> as regards discipline which i think may be the more important of the noble viscounts two points the professional bodies will police the people whom they approve because it will be in the professional bodies interests so to do <e> <s> otherwise by definition they will lose the respect of everybody which is to nobodys advantage <e>", "<cs> at this stage this must be the last question that i answer on this amendment <e> <s> i am not being unhelpful to the committee but i feel we have given the amendment a pretty good run <e> <s> i fully intend to write to every member of the committee who has spoken because obviously there are many matters which continue to worry people <e> <s> to answer the question of the noble baroness lady nicol theoretically the bill would allow the unattached architects to be approved directly by the secretary of state <e> <s> but we do not intend this to happen <e> <s> nor do we intend to request architects to be approved by the riba a point which i understood the noble baroness to say worries some of them <e> <s> there are two other possible designating bodies which would be able to approve architects <e> <s> these go under the acronyms fas and iaas <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has got it wrong and i am equally sure it is my fault for rather gabbling through my explanation <e> <s> the fees in question are the fees a body would charge its members for approval <e> <s> we are not talking about the fees that the inspector charges the developer for the certification work he is going to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord forgets about the magic word competition <e> <s> i have no doubt that fees in this respect will be broadly equal across the full range of designated bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are anxious to ensure that all sports facilities in both the public and private sectors are more widely used <e> <s> to this end we have approached the chairmen of all the nationalised industries chief constables chief fire officers and over top private sector employers <e> <s> the response has been very encouraging and we are now taking the initiative forward at the local level <e> <s> at the same time my honourable friend the minister for sport has been considering ways in which shared use of school and other community facilities can be extended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> she is quite right my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary is extremely active in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we are slowly winning through but it is a slow process of encouragement <e> <s> i think that this is the right way to pursue this activity <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord broxbourne who has enabled me to cut out quite a lot of what i might otherwise have said on this amendment <e> <s> i understand why the noble lord moved these two new clauses and i hope that i can reassure him <e>", "<cs> it is not just idle words and i am sure that the noble lord lord graham will believe this hut i understand the point that he is making and i have a great deal of sympathy for the <e>", "<cs> i was going to suggest to the noble lord that he did not tempt me into validating future legislation which he at least and i have only partly seen <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has finished with clause so perhaps it might be convenient if i started with it <e> <s> it requires an approved inspector to cancel an initial notice in certain circumstances <e> <s> these are first when he can no longer carry out his functions for example through incapacity or ill health secondly where he considers that the work is being carried out in a way that prevents him from carrying out his functions for example if he is not given information or calculations which he needs to perform his job and thirdly where he considers that there is a contravention and the developer has not taken steps to remedy the matter <e>", "<cs> clause deals with the effects of an initial notice ceasing to be in force <e> <s> this could happen because a notice has been cancelled by an inspector builder or local authority or because the building has been occupied without a final certificate having been given within the prescribed period <e> <s> in these circumstances the local authoritys responsibilities and powers in relation to building control revive i think this is the important point that the noble baroness may have missed within limits imposed by the clause <e>", "<cs> if my memory serves me right one of the objectives of the final certificate is that if the building or part of the project say it is a mixed development or a range of shops or a garage and so on which i think is the point which concerns the noble baroness is not fit for use it will not be able to be occupied <e> <s> i shall have to check into that point and confirm in writing <e>", "<cs> i appreciate it and i am sorry that i was talking in shorthand but i had anticipated that both the noble baroness and the noble lord had read my response to a question asked me by the noble lord lord irving of dartford on tuesday last in column of the <e>", "<cs> yes i do think that the words in the bill are sensible not surprisingly <e> <s> bodies approved under clause which will be able to certify their own work and those defined in clause which will be able to relax certain building regulations being exempt from the procedures of the building regulations under clause will all be public bodies acting under enactments for public purposes and not for their own profit <e> <s> i am advised that it would be misleading to refer to either category as designated rather than public bodies because they are referred to in the way that they are in this bill as they are referred to in other statutes whether they are statutes setting them up or whether they are statutes that pertain to them <e> <s> also it could give rise to confusion with bodies designated under clause to approve inspectors or those designated under clause to approve documents <e>", "<cs> i know that there has been some confusion between this clause and clause which we <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to this short debate but i am still not persuaded that clause should be omitted from the bill <e> <s> when my noble friend lord selkirk raised his original objections i understood that he was quite happy that a local authority or county council should be included but that his real worry was the phrase any other body <e> <s> if i am wrong he can correct me <e> <s> but before sweeping those two aside may i point out that this clause in part repeals what i can only describe as a legal dottiness <e> <s> at the moment a district council for example has to apply to itself pay itself fees submit plans to itself and so on <e> <s> of course it does no such thing because the officers move these things around among themselves <e> <s> none the less it is a legal requirement as current law goes and as i said it seems to me to be more than a little unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i really am surprised by the speech that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> has just made <e> <s> i have been at great pains to explain matters in response to lord selkirks opposing the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> that explanation contains the entire answer to the question which the noble lord has just asked <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am sorry but i really must take issue with the noble lord <e> <s> he must read the entire paragraph <e>", "<cs> when talking about clause <e>", "<cs> what i actually said was <e>", "<cs> i am advised that fees will be fees paid by the person seeking approval not fees to be paid by builders for the building control service <e> <s> so i think that i am giving though in different words exactly the same answer to the noble lord as i gave when he asked the same question on tuesday <e> <s> i do not have with me the act nor its various appurtenances <e> <s> perhaps it is a subject that is some way back in history and i should be better advised to write to the noble lord on the question of the persons who are covered by the act <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to answer the points made by the noble lord lord graham and the noble and learned lord lord simon at the beginning of this third day of the committee stage at around eight oclock but i should point out that it was agreed perfectly amicably through the usual channels that this third day should in fact be a half day <e>", "<cs> it was agreed that it should be not a full period of discussion <e> <s> the fact that the business came on a little later than any of us might have desired was totally beyond anybodys control <e> <s> i think that that is as far as i can go in answer to the noble and learned lord lord simon <e>", "<cs> we have already had quite an innings on this subject of insurance when discussing opposition amendments on clause on tuesday amendments to inclusive which are reported in columns to of the <e>", "<cs> let me make it clear at the beginning that i am not speaking for the home office <e> <s> the building regulations have until now been almost entirely substantive <e> <s> they impose technical requirements and they define what work is exempt or partly exempt <e> <s> in

friend lord molson called this an unanswerable case for consolidation we shall see <e> <s> it is an issue to which the <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the governments policy is entirely founded and consistent with the commonwealth statement on apartheid in sport as reaffirmed by my right honourable friend the prime minister and other commonwealth leaders at successive commonwealth heads of government meetings most recently at new delhi in november last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords the gleneagles agreement was a communiqu which was signed and reaffirmed as i said by all the commonwealth heads of government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been consistently doing all that we can to point out to the rugby football union that this is totally undesirable and counter-productive to its purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view but i would consider it distinctly undesirable <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> that was behind my answer to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord chalfont <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly there has been some easement of the policy of apartheid in sport in south africa but since sport is principally founded in schools which are still segregated i do not think that i can agree with the point of view which my noble friend has just expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already said that my honourable friend the minister for sport has been consistently doing that over the past few months <e> <s> i shall also have an opportunity in an unstarred question tomorrow to add my own words of discouragement to that particular sporting body <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as a debate is concerned if there is sufficient call for one i am quite sure that the usual channels will consider it in their usual manner <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot remember <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the second part of the noble lords supplementary question goes i am afraid i do not have any idea as to that <e> <s> as far as the first part goes yes he is quite right <e> <s> implicit in the original gleneagles agreement was the condemnation of apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is not as easy as that <e> <s> the membership of any organisation whether international or national carries with it both benefits and obligations <e> <s> depending on the point of view that noble lords take as to whether being a party to the gleneagles agreement is a benefit or an obligation and we have had both ideas expressed in our exchanges this afternoon then it would be for a general consensus of those same heads of government to change the policy which all governments would then follow were this to be seen to be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i will certainly look at that but it is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a communiqu which is commonly referred to as the gleneagles agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite a stunner and is certainly not my understanding of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for his consideration of the committee <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that this house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn during pleasure until twenty minutes before nine oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help my noble friend by agreeing with the noble baroness lady fisher that it is report stage and the normal form in which to make such interrogatory remarks would be to say before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords may the question be put <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the comments of the noble lord lord graham but i should tell him that the usual channels are currently consulting and as soon as i have something to tell the house i shall certainly report it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might now he allowed to return to the amendments on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated these identical amendments in committee <e> <s> i was therefore frankly surprised to see them reappearing on the marshalled list <e> <s> i can only assume that i was unclear then so i shall try again <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the possibility of delaying payment which is what i have been referring to in the last couple of minutes of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made another brief yet rather valiant attempt to add rents to the consultation process <e> <s> carefully though i listened to the argument i have to say that i am still not persuaded that the proposal is justified <e> <s> we considered it most carefully when we received many representations following our consultation paper and during the passage of the housing bill in <e> <s> i am convinced that local authorities would be as totally opposed to any requirement to consult over rent levels as they were when the proposal was first made in <e> <s> the amendment is effectively concerned not only with rent increases as a whole but with individual rents <e> <s> the proposed extra duty would be extremely onerous on local authorities and would add substantially to their administrative costs <e> <s> it would in short achieve little or nothing and would discredit the consultation process <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend who has taken me by surprise <e> <s> if he would allow me to do so i should prefer to write to him rather than to respond now to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already described at some length in committee our insurance proposals under this bill <e> <s> i readily take the point of the noble lord lord graham that these are complicated <e> <s> i explained the two alternative routes down which the bill allowed us to go under either subsection or subsection of clause as it is now numbered <e> <s> our current thinking remains that subsection is the right way forward <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would delete this subsection however leaving no option but to make regulations under subsection <e>", "<cs> however as i explained in committee certification under clause will not this is the important point and cannot begin until either insurance regulations are made prescribing the cover to be required or else a specific scheme or schemes has or have been approved for the purpose by the secretary of state <e> <s> if there were to be no insurance schemes then regulations would have to be made for <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will answer my noble friends points <e> <s> he questioned whether all approved inspectors will be properly qualified <e> <s> certainly they will be otherwise the designating body would not be confirmed by the secretary of state in the first place <e> <s> that is why i placed quite a large measure of reliance in my reply on the powers and policing ability of the designating bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i do not think it is quite right for the noble viscount to put words into my mouth and suggest what i might have said if i had been asked a particular question <e> <s> however he was asking whether under the new circumstances which might prevail at another stage i should feel able to accept an amendment such as he has just described <e> <s> i am afraid the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time my noble friend lord broxbourne has put his finger squarely on the first point that i wanted to make <e> <s> as i said in committee the

satisfied that it would be good practice for house builders to give the new owner all the necessary details about the construction and running of their home <e> <s> indeed i have said as much in committee <e> <s> but i do not think that it is a proper subject for inclusion as an extra clause in this bill <e> <s> indeed some such manual is to be provided by the national house building council

to his feet so smartly that i was not quite able to rise quickly enough <e> <s> i am afraid that this amendment will take rather longer to describe than have previous amendments <e> <s> what i have to

responsibility to fix their own fees will not be forced upon local authorities at short notice <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and to clause would allow the secretary of state to set a separate commencement day for this purpose <e> <s> it will be brought into effect only after there has been significant experience of the new system in operation so authorities will have opportunities to adjust their resources to an accurate assessment of the task facing them <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have only just heard for the first time the idea proposed by my noble friend he makes a valuable point which i shall certainly consider with my advisers <e> <s> obviously since i am being slightly bounced by this one i cannot give him any such commitment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i was getting side-tracked by the noble lords questions <e> <s> but this is in fact report stage <e> <s> i have moved the amendment and spoken again in winding up <e> <s> a detailed speech by the noble lord at this stage would therefore not be appropriate perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that these amendments had been spoken to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i am somewhat confused <e> <s> was the noble and learned lord asking me about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think quite and i am not very adept at doing consolidation on my feet <e> <s> however my understanding is that the words qualification and discount part i go in before the word schedule a in the bill in its current print <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that they precede the word schedule a <e>", "<cs> my lords most certainly i will and if i may write to the noble and learned lord on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment has not yet received the inspectors report following a public local inquiry into the application for this project <e> <s> when it is received the matter will be dealt with as speedily as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the normal time scale for receiving such a report is of the order of seven to eight months <e> <s> i can confirm that the stolport is in <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly one of the points that such an inquiry is there to discover <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already taken action to combat violence associated with soccer at home <e> <s> it is in part due to the success of these measures that some so-called football supporters now seek to cause trouble abroad <e> <s> thus my honourable friend the minister for sport has recently agreed with his colleagues within the council of europe a document listing the precautions which should be taken to curb violence <e> <s> in the light of the violence in paris however my honourable friend is again reviewing all the options open to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords there are as many theories about why these misguided people commit such acts as there are theories about preventing them from doing so in the first place <e> <s> the two theories which are currently being floated are boredom and the fact that hooliganism is far worse when matches are lost than when matches are won <e> <s> i cannot place any reliance on either one of those theories <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is to a great degree correct <e> <s> my information is that the austrian authorities arrested or so english people before the game started for various acts of hooliganism and vandalism <e> <s> they were all released on rd march but have been banned from returning to austria for five years <e> <s> if one is in a situation where one can identify certain people before a match starts then obviously that is the optimum position to be in <e> <s> so often the trouble erupts both during and after a match <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as semantics are concerned the noble lord is quite right and supporters of hooliganism may well be a more appropriate term <e> <s> i must confess that i did strike out from my brief at one stage the words mindless thugs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it might but i am afraid that our researches have shown that it is difficult to link misbehaviour directly to alcohol <e> <s> where alcohol has been shown to be a contributory cause and this i am afraid to say does happen in the north-east of england and in scotland the banning of alcohol has had a very great effect in the correct direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is right but that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords from this dispatch box i cannot answer for the french police <e>", "<cs> as has already been referred to it is an open secret that during the debate on second reading the government displayed little enthusiasm for the bill <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord wallace was disappointed that he did not seem to be getting goodwill from the government <e> <s> instead he said <e>", "<cs> as far as giant green peas are concerned perhaps the noble lord might like to get in touch with the henry doubleday research association or indeed the national vegetable research association but i shall leave that matter to him <e> <s> i am not going to be quite as severe as the noble lord lord wallace thinks <e> <s> this amendment improves the bill to the extent that it removes the proposed obligation upon authorities to keep separate accounts of receipts and expenditure and the duty which would require them to publish annual accounts <e> <s> as amended however it would require monies and receipts arising from the sale of allotment land not to <e>", "<cs> on the previous amendment when the noble lord lord graham was speaking about the bill i may not have been very clear in my explanation <e> <s> however as long as the local authority feels that there is still a need for allotment gardens even though it was pressurised in the way in which the noble lord lord graham suggests it would then need the permission of the secretary of state to sell <e> <s> this was something which was retained in the local government planning and land act about which the noble lord has just complained a little <e> <s> as i said on <e>", "<cs> i think the explanation for this amendment is rather fuller than that which the noble lord lord wallace has just given us <e>", "<cs> none my lords <e> <s> however the water authority chairmen follow a code of practice to <e>", "<cs> my lords it was exactly because of the capital structure of the water boards and the millions and millions of pounds involved in their asset values the noble lord quoted billion that the government decided that the old way of organising water authorities was no longer appropriate and therefore used the water act to set up new small executive boards like those of major private sector companies <e> <s> i really cannot describe them as meeting in camera following the tone of the noble lords remarks because of course they are fully accountable to the secretary of state who is himself fully accountable to parliament <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of the meeting in another place to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> it is for the water authorities themselves if they want to do so to vary the code <e> <s> for example in the case of the welsh water authority board meetings are open to the press <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that it does <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the code of practice followed by all water authorities implies that they shall inform the press after each and every one of their meetings and this they are most certainly doing <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly why consumer consultative committees are to be set up this summer <e> <s> agreement has now been obtained all round <e> <s> on average per cent <e> <s> of the representation on these committees will be from local authority members <e>", "<cs> my lords they are still able to do so because of course they are still able to question the accounts and the underlying figures that make up the published accounts of the water authorities <e> <s> as to the noble lords first point concerning my right honourable friend the prime minister and her being involved with the enactment of the public bodies admission to meetings act yes of course this is perfectly correct it is on the record <e> <s> but i do not see that with the structure as we now have it under the water act the water authorities can be described as a public body in the way that that act describes them <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who when i went home at the weekend received his annual water bill i must say i was rather surprised by the amount <e> <s> however the proper forum for discussing this and for taking up the complaint will be through the consumer consultative committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are two different thoughts involved in that supplementary question but surely the point is that as i said in answer to the original supplementary question of the noble lord lord dean because of their executive responsibility for a company which is although in the public sector to all intents and purposes a companies act company there is no reason why their board meetings should be any different from those of a company in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords most certainly they will be able not only to advise but also to recommend in their own reports to the water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid i do not see the relevance of our legislation on the restructuring of local government in so far as the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan counties goes because after all the elector will be electing only one tier of local government in those areas and from that tier will come the representation on the consumer consultative committees that i described earlier <e>", "<cs> no my lords because there is every chance to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the length of this answer <e> <s> the nature conservancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be premature to draw the conclusion as my noble friend has done that the act is too expensive to operate <e> <s> there is no general evidence of extravagant demands for management agreements but naturally the government will keep the costs of such compensation under close review <e> <s> there has never been a case of a management agreement failing through lack of funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i think and i am surprised by it since the noble baroness was involved in the passing of the act in this house and i was not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says she was not <e> <s> but she was certainly aware of what was going on at that time <e> <s> the whole basis of the act is not that one should seek to conserve everything <e> <s> the act covers those areas which have been identified by the nature conservancy council as areas of special scientific interest <e> <s> there is no doubt that over a period of years changes will occur in the countryside through normal changes in fanning practices <e> <s> there is no way with the best will in the world that this can or should be stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information about what might be called the try-on underlying the noble lords question <e> <s> of course we look to the bodies offering agreements to satisfy themselves that the planned operation is a genuine proposal <e> <s> they will be in the best position to make such judgments in the light of their local knowledge as and when occasion demands <e> <s> if false claims were made to any great extent the total amount payable for compensation would become so great that the government would have to consider statutory controls <e> <s> this would be totally counter-productive to fanners interests generally and i suggest to the interests of conservation too <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said up to the present there has never been a management agreement refused on financial grounds <e> <s> as regards the two specific questions that my noble friend asked me i am afraid that i cannot answer without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i must correct the noble lord <e> <s> there is indeed a fallback power in the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> this is the so-called section order that has been used in three cases since the act came into force <e> <s> so far as the north york moors national park is concerned i do not know the details but i would suspect that in the cases that the noble lord has mentioned they are not covered by a site of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the cost around which discussion seems to have revolved this afternoon really enters into it <e> <s> the government are prepared and have been prepared to make the funds available for the management agreements <e> <s> so far as the cap goes there is no doubt in my mind that the high return for crops sometimes resulting from the cap is obviously a factor in the equation <e> <s> but the indexation provisions of the financial guidelines provide that if the sales value of the new crop reduces then so will the compensation payable <e> <s> in any event the important point to <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so i should like to look closely at proof of it <e> <s> as i said in reply to an earlier supplementary i have no evidence that that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady white is quite right in saying that this is not merely a local matter and in the course of my speech i want to set this in the context of a much wider perspective <e> <s> in that connection i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for providing this opportunity for me to restate the governments policy on the protection of our areas of outstanding natural beauty <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord for providing my noble friend <e> <s> lord saint levan with a platform for his maiden speech a thoughtful and most interesting contribution <e> <s> i should perhaps say that the platform is a slightly more level one than my noble friends more normal perch on st michaels mount <e> <s> at the moment i am unable to answer his detailed questions but if i may i will write to him <e> <s> on one of his more general points i would say that what is acceptable design in one area may not be in another <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there is a difference between annually-renewed temporary permissions and a permanent permission <e> <s> how could i say otherwise <e> <s> i think the point that i was trying to make was that these annual permissions had been going on for a very long time <e> <s> the decision was that no permission at all could be granted unless access was improved <e> <s> access was improved and the application was for a permanent permission for these tents and caravans <e> <s> the local planning authority can only determine an application that is put in front of them <e> <s> they saw no objection in the light of the new circumstances to refusing that application which was put in front of them <e> <s> equally i do not see any reason why they should have determined it any other way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says just you wait <e> <s> all that i can say is that if anybody puts in an application i should look very carefully at the planning authority <e> <s> every case must be decided on its merits and the history of this planning consent which i believe to come out right for the reasons i have given should not be taken as a precedent for future applications whether in the immediate vicinity or anywhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to answer the points made by the noble lord point for point because a good third of the questions that he asked i have already answered in the course of my speech by pointing out that the actual planning permission for this development at higher kenneggy was as a result of a continued series of successful applications and not as a new development <e>", "<cs> my lords i have again listened with great interest to my noble friend lady vickers <e> <s> she and the noble baroness lady denington at report stage rightly pointed out that the courts have ruled that as the law now stands council housing authorities cannot serve public health or other statutory notices on themselves <e> <s> from that advantage point and i might say to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords doe circulars are not exactly in my gift <e> <s> i take the point my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the answer to the main question of the noble lord lord somers was in my speech that when it comes to the ultimate position the remedy is through the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords my remarks included the interior where the interior is structural <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord evans of claughton has made clear this amendment is similar to that which he tabled and divided the house on at committee stage <e> <s> since then i have studied with care the points that were made by those noble lords who spoke <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans has also written to me about his amendment expressing concern about the reluctance of a few local authorities to enter into management agreements with their tenants <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for writing to me in that way and for coming to see me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am beginning to wonder whether this is a private fight or whether anybody can join in <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord wallace of coslany was in the chamber last night when we discussed the rates bill but my noble friend most certainly was <e> <s> he spoke for the government <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said and if he was not in the chamber last night i would that he had been because we might have been in the same lobby my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way it is the other way around <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace in his speech just now rallied to the cause of the government rather than me rallying to the cause of the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords from our experience in his time with us no one in your lordships house can be surprised at the interest of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey in local government <e> <s> irrespective of his expertise in digital mapping he has made clear on this bill and in his second speech today <e>", "<cs> my lords i know from experience that the house does not exactly like shopping lists <e> <s> i do not propose to give it one <e> <s> i have a detailed list in front of me which perhaps i may show the noble lord afterwards <e> <s> in summary some reviews have been completed and orders have been made and some have been completed and no proposals have been made <e> <s> i can see a couple with the local government boundary commission and there are no <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the noble lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> i must have expressed myself rather badly <e> <s> what i am saying is that for the purposes of my case although i agree not necessarily for the purposes of his case the important thing is that the reviews either are being undertaken or will be undertaken and there is a commitment by the district councils so to do <e> <s> whether this at the end of the day arrives with the creation of new parishes is not necessarily the point in my book anyway because what we need is a sympathetic review as provided for under the local government act and this as i have said we are having <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord mcintosh i was making what i thought and the government consider to be valid points <e> <s> i was not trying to make it into a party political matter and i hope he will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the white paper cmnd <e> <s> of the government proposed that a small statutory body should be established to deal with certain residual responsibilities of the greater london council including the handling of residual superannuation matters <e> <s> the comments which have been made on that proposal are being considered <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that the rights of existing pensioners will be fully safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some difficulty over the first supplementary question of the noble baroness because the question on the order paper refers to the glc whereas i understand that in her supplementary she is referring also to the metropolitan counties for which as the house will know the government also have proposals <e> <s> i shall therefore answer her second supplementary question <e> <s> existing employees transferred to successor bodies whether or not they are borough councils will take their pension rights with them <e> <s> however existing pensioners and those not re-employed in local government service will stay in a unified fund <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no intention to break up the existing fund <e> <s> it will be transferred lock stock and barrel to the residual body to which i referred in my original answer <e> <s> with regard to the second supplementary question of the noble baroness the details are still to be announced but i shall make sure that the point raised by the noble baroness is taken fully into account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly it will <e>", "<cs> this might be an appropriate moment to resume the house and to tell your lordships that we do not propose to return to the committee stage of this bill before pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now

<e>", "<cs> my lords what we are talking about is the disposal of a ruin <e> <s> whether or not the councils action at that time was the correct way to proceed does not relate to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly where procedures are laid down i would expect them to be followed <e> <s> but i should not like to go into any great detail in this case because it is quite possible that my right honourable friend may be asked to exercise his quasi-judicial powers and therefore i think that the house would not expect me to comment on details <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to my noble friend i do not think i ought to become entangled in the merits of the building either before or after <e> <s> but i most certainly stand corrected <e> <s> i should have added as my noble friend so rightly said <e>", "<cs> again my lords i am not the right person to answer that question <e> <s> the noble baroness should address that question to the council concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords at the environment council in june last year we tabled a memorandum together with the federal republic of germany the netherlands and denmark calling for the introduction of unleaded petrol throughout the european community as soon as possible <e> <s> the ec commission have since been examining the implications of doing this and are due to produce specific proposals for discussion at the next environ-ment council meeting in june <e> <s> we have not yet seen these but as soon as we do we shall invite comments from industry and interested groups <e>", "<cs> no my lords is not the earliest date that the british have offered <e> <s> what we have said is that we see it as a practicable date to aim for for we shall do all in our power to achieve unleaded petrol before that time <e> <s> that remains our position <e> <s> but from the end of petrol will contain a very small amount of lead per cent <e> <s> less than it does at present <e> <s> we are intent upon removing the remainder as a matter of general prudence <e> <s> when my honourable friend the under-secretary goes to the council of ministers at the end of june he will put forward exactly that point of view and will try his very hardest to seek agreement to an early completion of the course which we have set ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of the environment continues to encourage the implementation of waste recycling schemes where they are both economic and practicable <e> <s> it provides advice on many aspects of recycling through its advisory publications and its meetings with representatives of waste disposal authorities and the private sector <e> <s> the government continue to give support to bottle banks and can recycling schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble baronesss first point is concerned on the use of recycled paper in government departments of course it is for each government department to make a decision on its own costing and the quality required because in all recycling the important things are both the economics and the final quality <e> <s> but most certainly i would expect other government departments to give serious thought to this in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords this is certainly part of the problem <e> <s> however as i said to the noble baroness in answer to her last supplementary question i am well aware that not only are there just over bottle banks in this country but where appropriate local councils and others are introducing more of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is perfectly correct in the figures that he gave <e> <s> i should not like to go so far as to say the demolition of a forest the size or the area of wales <e> <s> i can tell the noble and learned lord that million tonnes per cent <e> <s> of our total fibre requirements are met by the paper and board industry from the recycling of waste paper <e> <s> again this is a step in the right direction but when paper is recycled the quality drops <e> <s> a high grade coated paper which of course is coated with china clay cannot be used again for the same purpose which is why ultimately at the bottom end of the scale such

noble lord lord irving credits me with more influence than i have with the usual channels <e> <s> however i am quite certain that the matter to which he refers will be taken up by the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i count the number of papers which i have seen before which arrived on my desk this morning i do not think that there would be any doubt in my mind that the noble lords question is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly there is but i also made the point that what is important and has to be considered each time on its merits are both the quality of the product and the economics <e> <s> these will vary from department to department which was the point i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that any opportunities for exports there are in whatever field will be energetically pursued as they are by the government at the moment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume i should say that it

keen supporter of the envelope schemes to which the noble baroness has referred <e> <s> on the other part of her question in grants will again be financed from within individual authorities housing improvement programme allocations and authorities housing investment needs have been taken into account in determining those allocations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course we monitor the condition of the housing stock of local authorities <e> <s> we take account of those sums of money that they themselves feel they will require in setting the grant-related expenditure and the hip programmes to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton was not intended to be a facile answer in any sense of the word <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness should have taken it that way <e> <s> but it is always for the local authority within the resources both self-generated and allocated to them through the support structures that i referred to earlier to make the decisions for people in their areas <e> <s> if it becomes apparent to the government and to my honourable friend the minister for housing and construction that those resources are not sufficient then we shall do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords any business whether it is the business of running a vast local authority or whether it is the business of running a private limited company has to operate within its financial structure and strictures <e> <s> within those each business has to set its priorities for itself <e> <s> if as in this case a local authority decides that it should spend money on for example sheltered housing rather than on removing homeless people from the hotels an issue which is so much criticised in this house that really is a matter

outcome of that consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood it the pressure from the charities which has been taken up both in your lordships house and in another place has been on the zero rating of charities so far as value <e>", "<cs> my lords if the structural alterations to which the noble lord referred are on the local authoritys own stock they will be able to get this refunded

thumb we looked at population density in deciding whether an area is rural or not <e> <s> on making representations for the implications for rural areas of the right to buy proposals before the bill

my lords private dwellings were started in great britain in per cent <e> <s> more than in <e>", "<cs> my lords without unduly wearying the house i do not think i could do that in detail but i can confirm that more private houses and flats were started last year than in any year during the last labour administration <e> <s> as regards the credit which my noble friend gives to the building industry yes it has proved itself very responsive to new demands and the improving economic climate <e> <s> i too congratulate the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid i do not have the detailed breakdown that my noble friend requests but i most certainly agree that the certification scheme has produced houses of a very high quality and the government are in general satisfied with the working of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord bellwin and i have frequently made the point that selling off public sector housing does not make houses one whit less available for living in as units <e> <s> as regards the substantive point made by the noble lord lord graham yes he is perfectly right we are starting from a very low base but the fact that there is this very significant improvement i have just mentioned the figure of per cent <e> <s> means that more houses are becoming available for people to live in <e> <s> the houses are being built and this is a sign of the economic recovery as my noble friend suggested <e> <s> it is a fact that if one looks back over housing figures for the past or years the slumps and increases in those figures coincide almost exactly with the general economic climate <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> in a series of questions that i answered in the house recently on grants for renovations i pointed out if my memory serves me correctly that some grants were given last year and that this has gone a long way towards improving the situation to which the noble lord draws attention <e> <s> obviously one can always spend more money on any particular project which noble lords or the government have in mind but this must be within ones overall financial and budgetary strategy across the whole economy <e> <s> i think i have said enough <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extremely wide question <e> <s> if i may i shall look up the details and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i would make the general point that it is very often extremely difficult to identify building workers whether employed or unemployed because they do not always register <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is far far wide of the question <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down yet another question on this subject i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can certainly confirm the success of the governments right-to-buy policy <e> <s> there are many people up and down the country who have seen the way ahead in exactly the way that my noble friend herself has seen it this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it might be appropriate if i reminded the house that the question on the order paper refers to private housing starts <e>", "<cs> my lords what makes the difference to the large number of people waiting for a house in which to live is first the size of council waiting lists <e> <s> this is also reflected in the number of empty properties that councils have on their books as well as the very encouraging private housing starts to which i have referred this morning <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> swinging moorings are those moorings which are unattached to land and which can be temporarily removed for servicing <e> <s> generally speaking they are those to which the boat or vessel is attached <e> <s> the boat or vessel is attached by a buoy to the mooring at the bottom of the seabed <e> <s> the weight to which the buoy is attached is attached by a line to the shore otherwise it would float away <e> <s> therefore the moorings being temporary it was thought desirable that they should no longer be liable to be used for rating purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i should explain that schedule deals with the rating of moorings and has been the subject of a very large number of representations mainly from yacht clubs and owners <e> <s> among these there is widespread and i have to say mistaken belief that the schedule places a new tax on yachting <e> <s> let me say quite clearly that the schedule as it currently stands in no way affects the basic rateability of moorings which has existed for a very long time <e> <s> in practice however many moorings have escaped rating because of the difficulty of identifying occupiers while others have had to pay rates <e> <s> this is clearly unfair <e> <s> schedule therefore ensures that that liability can be better enforced by providing valuation officers with discretion to assess a group of moorings in separate occupation as a single hereditament in the occupation of the owner <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as one who spent a great portion of the easter recess sailing and when i was not sailing attaching the boat to a swinging mooring i shall be delighted to answer the noble baronesss intriguing questions <e> <s> my honourable friend the under-secretary of state has received more than letters in the department on the subject of this amendment or rather should i say on the subject of a concern which i suspect the noble baroness and the noble lord lord graham well understand <e> <s> as a result of answering those letters i should say that he has been able to convince those members of yachting associations and private boating associations of the justice of the measure that the government are seeking to bring forward in schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the wrong noble baroness behind me who happened to say hear hear at that moment because i would have expected my noble friend lady vickers who in this house and outside it is a great champion of the environmental health officers to respond to the remark that i have just made <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the commons amendment be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment <e> <s> since the somerset house bill was last considered by this house one amendment has been made in another place <e> <s> i therefore seek your lordships approval to the bill as amended <e> <s> rather than read out the amendment i hope it will be helpful if i rephrase clause with the amendment included <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords this short debate exactly proves the difficulty <e> <s> we have one idea on the wording from the noble baroness lady birk another from the noble lord lord beaumont and yet a third from the noble lord lord houghton who does not trust either them or me <e> <s> i thought this might happen and i took the trouble to take legal advice on this point <e> <s> i am advised by lawyers that in law the words make absolutely no difference as amended now from when they were originally on the face of the bill and as discussed by your lordships house <e> <s> however the fact that the noble lord lord beaumont feels that it is stronger and the noble lord lord houghton feels that it is more in keeping with his way of thinking means to me that the public relations value if one may be allowed to have a public relations value on the face of an act of parliament has made this operation well worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may make a very quick point before any order is laid under this bill under clause there must be an affirmative instrument of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can speak for the whole house and say that it seems strange to be speaking in a debate on this subject without the advice from behind me of the late lord glenkinglas an acknowledged expert in this as in so many other fields <e> <s> he is sadly missed by your lordships <e> <s> however i am delighted to welcome the maiden speech of my noble friend lord blakenham with his experience as chairman of the rspb <e> <s> i hope we shall hear him again soon and often when he feels he can spread his wings but still refrain from the controversy on this regrettably most controversial of subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point but i think i ought to get on with my speech <e> <s> it would not be untrue to say that my noble friend lord avon or indeed anybody speaking from this box at that time was often overburdened with ideas for improvements from all sides of this house ideas which were not practical at that time because the agreement of all those involved conservationists farmers government departments your lordships and members of another place not necessarily in that order was not forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to say and of course i bow to my noble friends superior knowledge of proceedings in another place- do not think it would be proper to make an announcement before the second reading of that bill which i am assured will be happening on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness did understand me correctly but i disagree with her that there will be a domino effect for the simple reason that on one side of this land there is ploughed land and on the other side there is a railway line <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord renton who obviously knows the area would confirm this <e> <s> therefore i see this as a totally isolated piece of land <e>", "<cs> my lords hope springs eternal <e> <s> in considering this amendment it is only fair i think to point out that this is well trampled ground <e> <s> we have debated several times the parliamentary procedures for imposing rate limits on authorities with which the secretary of state cannot come to an agreement <e> <s> i believe that earlier amendments at successive stages on this particular point have been withdrawn without debate <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend announced most of the membership of the newly constituted boards of the regional water authorities last september and five additional members were announced during the following months <e> <s> your lordships house was promised during the passage of the water act that between two and four members of each authority would be drawn from local government nominations <e> <s> out of a total of appointees are also serving members of local authorities no regional authority has fewer than two councillors among its membership one has six <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can agree that there is an unhealthy imbalance between the tiers of local authorities <e> <s> the composition of the boards varies between authorities but overall there are county councillors including the metropolitan county councils and the glc and district councillors including the metropolitan district <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the questions of the noble lord lord winstanley in reverse order local authorities do not have an automatic right because as i said in my answer to the original question there are local authority members on the executive boards of the water authorities <e> <s> the first meetings of consumer consultative committees are being held at the moment and the remainder will follow during the summer <e> <s> as to how members are being selected this will be done by a combination of public advertisements for household consumers and by nomination by representative bodies <e> <s> ultimately the appointment is in the hands of the individual water authority itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord will remember because he was a whip in another place at the time the water act had as its rationale the streamlining of what were then very large water authority boards to make them executive boards equivalent to private sector companies act companies <e> <s> from two to four local authority representatives on the boards was agreed after much discussion in another place and in your lordships house to be about the right balance for the kind of objective the government had in mind for water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords a local authority member is of course a representative member of local authority although he has other roles to fulfil <e> <s> but the water authority members themselves whether from a local authority or any other background are appointees of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> i will check on the situation and if i may write to the noble baroness about those particular points <e> <s> i do not see that it matters that a district councillor is necessarily a member of each water authority <e> <s> what matters is that the governments commitment that there would be from two to four local authority representatives as appointees on the water authorities which was given during the passage of this bill through your lordships house has been fulfilled <e> <s> i am glad that in her first supplementary question the noble baroness recognised the fulfilment of that commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords before we resume the short debate on changes in arts policy in the name of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i think i should inform the house that the revised time for the end of this debate is now pm and my noble friend the minister must begin his speech minutes before the end <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that the average time for speeches should be six minutes <e>", "<cs> s my lords may we ask the noble lord to conclude his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to tell the house that the restoration of the ceiling of this chamber has progressed according to plan during the last year and is now nearing completion <e> <s> work to refix the original painted panels and timber carvings and to redecorate the ceiling should be completed next month <e> <s> all that then remains to be done is the cleaning and restoring of the painted stone wall arches and the removal of the scaffolding deck <e> <s> this will take place during the summer recess <e> <s> by the time the house returns in the autumn the ceiling should be visible in all its former glory <e> <s> may i take this opportunity to thank noble lords for their patience and understanding throughout this project <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the property services agency and to the firms involved in the work <e> <s> the work should be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly intended to wash the magna carta barons at both ends of the chamber so that the gilt will become more obvious but it is not intended at this moment to regild those particular statues where the gilt exists on for example the belt buttons <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a slightly different question <e> <s> i am glad to say that the position is temporary <e> <s> the london electricity board has suffered a major transformer failure on the charing cross supply to the palace of westminster <e> <s> repairs will take approximately one week and normal supplies to the palace will not be restored before rd july <e> <s> the house is being supplied with electricity from the property services agencys standby power station in whitehall <e> <s> until supplies are back to normal provision of cooling will not be possible in the chamber but ventilation will still be available <e> <s> in order to tie this answer in with my previous answers perhaps i should say that it will not unduly affect the work on the ceiling <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the work on the ceiling has had a very satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the real importance is that the ceiling should not fall down anywhere <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that discussions on a small celebration for the reopening of the ceiling are happening at the moment and i have no doubt that at some stage there will be an announcement on the subject from the woolsack <e> <s> i also bear in mind the magic date of th october <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> they are very well fixed in their place and my understanding is that they will remain so <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> regretfully there are great problems in the peers lobby <e> <s> additional loading has been placed upon the supporting cast-iron beams which is causing great concern <e> <s> as your lordships will have noticed a protective scaffolding and platform have been erected and work above the platform should start this summer <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give the house any information as to how long it might take <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry to which the noble lords question refers has been completed but my right honourable friend the secretary of state has not yet received the inspectors report <e> <s> when he has done so and has taken his decision whether or not the development should proceed the local planning authority will be informed <e> <s> the report will then be available to anyone who attended the inquiry and asked for a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble lord did understand me correctly <e> <s> the decision will be made by my right honourable friend before the report is published <e> <s> this is normal practice in all planning inquiries <e> <s> the purpose of all inquiries is to consider all matters relating to the development and the objections to it <e> <s> i have no doubt that the matters referred to by the noble lord lord kings norton and any other pertinent matter will be included in the inspectors report <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i am not in a position to give that undertaking to my noble friend <e> <s> the controversial nature of the development and the local feeling about it prompted my right honourable friend to arrange the public local inquiry in the first place though he is not statutorily bound to do so because this as i am sure is well known involves crown land <e> <s> there were various technical aspects of the inquiry and my right honourable friend had a technical assessor appointed to sit with the inspector at the inquiry to assist with the evaluation of technical evidence <e> <s> i therefore have no doubt that the report of the inspector will include as i said to the noble lord lord kings norton all pertinent matters <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing wholeheartedly with the noble lord lord ardwick in his praise of the bbc external services with which i had some small connection when i was speaking for the foreign and commonwealth office some two years ago this particular matter is <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly call the attention of my right honourable friend to my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that my right honourable friend will consider the points made by my noble friend and i shall make sure that he has the opportunity so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord ardwick i have nothing but praise for the bbcs external services <e> <s> the original reason for starting this transmitter was that the external services of the bbc have a need to be heard more strongly and more widely in certain parts of the world <e> <s> again i will take up the point raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that all the points raised this afternoon including that of the noble lord lord rhodes will have been raised during this inquiry <e> <s> the inspector will report his findings on the matter and it will be on that report that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will take a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully expect that this too will be covered in the inspectors report but again i will bear in mind the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which is being made in another place in answer to a private notice question from the member for copeland <e> <s> the question was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and the noble baroness lady nicol for their initial response to the statement <e> <s> perhaps i fell into my usual trap of speaking too fast when i have countryside matters to impart to your lordships because i do not think that the noble baroness understood the tenor of what i said when i repeated the statement <e> <s> i can confirm most certainly that the acres were those referred to in both the noble baronesss question and my answer to our debate on th june <e> <s> my answer to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley is exactly the same as i gave then <e> <s> i have no doubt that he has read and cogitated on my words and i see no reason to change them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> on wednesday th june i reported to the house the facts as they then were <e> <s> on the following friday it became apparent that there had <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness if i did not understand the full purport of her second question <e> <s> the answer is that as she will know discussions are in progress between her honourable friend and my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary with as i understand it the honourable member of copeland involved <e> <s> discussions will have to come to a head some time this week on the subject of a bill to amend section of the countryside and wildlife act proposed by mr peter hardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in reply to the unstarred question tabled by my noble friend lord onslow nearly three weeks ago that there was nothing absolutely fixed about the compensation arrangements and that the government would need to look at them again <e> <s> i said that it was always understood at the time when they were written that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the argument is surely about whether one is paying people to do nothing or paying people to stop doing something <e> <s> over and above that it would not be appropriate for the crown to take over the land <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hunt is quite right <e> <s> my right honourable friend the then secretary of state for the environment made the announcement to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> on the other hand circumstances change and in the light of todays events it seems that that particular statement was not pertinent <e> <s> as to the general changes to the wildlife and countryside act this matter is being discussed at the moment and i am grateful for your lordships views to further those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord ennals has put rather more heat into that question than it actually deserves <e> <s> i accept straightaway that the land of the halvergate marshes is grade land and was so designated some years ago <e> <s> since then the situation has changed <e> <s> why <e> <s> i am immediately asked <e> <s> it is because this land is on the edge of a grade area <e> <s> it has been ploughed on two sides and has a railway on a third <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals says that he knows the area <e> <s> he may well be able to confirm i have been unable to establish this in the brief time available this morning that on the fourth side there is a river <e> <s> to me that means that although it was so disignated it can no longer reasonably be expected to remain in that position <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> my argument is that if you have what is a unique piece of land it should be judged on its merits and the merits are as i have just described them to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords this time i am quite definitely and uncategorically grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that what my noble friend lord craigton is advocating is that there should be automatic planning controls in a situation such as this <e> <s> i know this is one of the ideas that is floating around but at the moment i do not think it is something which i should like to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe although the house obviously does that this is something which is indefensible <e> <s> apart from that i am grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord kintore and the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal because they have made several of the points that i wanted to make myself <e> <s> i think it would be helpful to the committee if i said first of all that this commission is nothing unusual <e> <s> in relation to the two reorganisations that we have on the statute book to date namely the london government act and the local government act indeed within certain tolerances which will become obvious as i speak it is identical to those two staff commissions <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord graham i think it is common ground that a staff commission of some sort in such circumstances should be set up <e> <s> but i also think it is important for me to tell the committee that its main purpose will be to ensure fair treatment to staff affected by the abolition working by influence and persuasion in consultation with representative bodies of staff and employers as well as the authorities concerned <e> <s> that is one of the points that has been made in this small debate <e>", "<cs> i accept that but i also accept the point of the noble baroness lady fisher that proper arrangements must be made for the establishment of the staff commission in good time for it to do an effective job of work <e>", "<cs> i should be perfectly happy for my right honourable friend to be consulted by whomever wishes to consult with him in the circumstances <e> <s> the great problem we have had over our entire plan for this bill is that although consultation has been offered again and again and we have put out a white paper for the main abolition bill consultations and comments on it have been less than forthcoming <e> <s> but what i in fact said originally was that once the commission is set up it can consult with anybody it likes <e> <s> having said that i go back to what i said in my original answer to the noble lord <e> <s> lord graham yes my right honourable friend will be perfectly happy to consult with those who want to consult him <e>", "<cs> i know it was a genuine comment which was made by the noble lord lord graham but so was my own <e> <s> i endorse every word that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has just said <e> <s> if the willingness to consult had been really there then ever since this bill has been printed and made publicly available consultations could have been held at the instigation of those people about whom we are talking <e>

that is a slight paraphrase of what he said but i think that it was his intention <e> <s> before moving on to this amendment may i say that i am perfectly happy to read very carefully the small debate on the noble lords last amendment <e> <s> in the constructive spirit with which he has spoken i shall be perfectly happy to do the same with this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> obviously i did not make myself clear the first time around <e> <s> the only reason for this power of direction relates to those who are affected by it when they for one reason or another make the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if in some unenvisagable circumstances the london borough of enfield were to say quite firmly no this is something up with which we will not put but then other london boroughs all agreed and had discussions with the staff commission then that may well be the sort of circumstance in which the secretary of state might threaten a direction <e>", "<cs> please will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> the staff commissions will not impose anything on anybody <e> <s> they will only be seeing to it that there is a fair deal for the staff <e> <s> earlier i gave a list of the commissions responsibilities <e> <s> at this eleventh hour it might be appropriate if i told the committee what a staff commission will not do <e>", "<cs> i suppose it is par for the course <e> <s> i am not really doing very well this afternoon am i <e> <s> i sought to explain in my original response to this set of amendments that amendment no <e> <s> would oblige the secretary of state to consult with relevant authorities about the proposed terms of any direction before he could make it but since a direction by definition would normally only be necessary because the relevant body had refused to be co-operative or reasonable i really cannot envisage a circumstance in which there would be any point in such consultations unless it was a deliberate attempt to delay and frustrate the commissions efforts on behalf of the staff <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat confused by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i understood that it had been arranged that we would take amendments nos <e> <s> and separately <e> <s> he then appeared to go ahead and speak to the whole lot <e> <s> i am quite happy to fit in with his plans as long as the committee understand that that is what we are doing at the moment <e>", "<cs> would the committee find it useful if i was to refer to it <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall take the advice of the noble lord lord boothby on a previous occasion and shut up <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord mcintosh of course his experience of greater <e>", "<cs> this clause does not prevent them from doing that <e> <s> it simply stops the secretary of state having a duty which is what i have sought to explain all along <e>", "<cs> my lords recent disappointing performance levels have owed much to industrial relations difficulties associated with the annual pay round and with the post offices ongoing drive to increase the efficiency of the business <e> <s> this followed a period of improvement in service in late and in when the post office came close to meeting its delivery targets <e> <s> in the light of the recent deterioration the post office undertook an intensive review of mail arrangements in london <e> <s> this review has now been completed and far-reaching changes implemented <e> <s> the government will now he discussing with the post office its plans to secure significant and sustained improvements over recent delivery performance <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer was not intended to he a declaration of intent but to indicate that the post office board is doing something for example a better breakdown of postal services for london districts traffic in inner area offices a reduction in the number of weekday first class dispatches between inner area offices to two per day and a separate van network solely for inner area to inner area first-class traffic <e> <s> i accept my noble friends point that the public are suffering both distress and inconvenience from the failure of the post office to meet performance targets <e> <s> but this is due to the changeover in the management of the post office who are going a considerable way towards reducing restrictive working practices within the organisation <e> <s> regretfully this cannot be done overnight so some disruption w ill i am afraid continue for some little time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly prepared to look at it but my information is that the introduction of the second-class letter postage has nothing to do with the problem <e> <s> if we still had a single rate and delivery service all that would have happened would be that the whole system would be very much worse rather than just part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a different question but it is of course an important policy aim of the government to reduce the size and scope of the public sector and privatisation in all sectors is under review <e> <s> the post office is not excluded from this review although there are no immediate plans to privatise the corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent mechanisation programme is proceeding apace and relies to a great extent on postal codes but the post office has not been encouraging use of postal codes until the mechanisation process is complete <e> <s> once it is complete i have no doubt that the post office will follow my noble friends suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is the profit motive alone which has caused this i hope temporary deterioration from the post offices published aims <e> <s> as far as the surpluses that are made by the post office are concerned i did not have the million figure for last year but i can tell the noble lord that they have had surpluses of million since the year <e> <s> i may add for the information of the house that they owe the national loans fund million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he is perfectly right but until the machinery exists in all sorting offices to deal with the postal codes the post office feel that there is little point in encouraging more than they are at the moment the use of the code <e>", "<cs> my lords the nine elms sorting office is i would say a great improvement which affects not only the whole of london but also the postage throughout the whole country because so much mail goes through london <e> <s> i accept that in its building and implementation there have been hiccoughs such as those in his own district of wimbledon to which the noble lord referred but when it is fully operational i can assure the noble lord that he will find the service considerably better <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am grateful to my noble friend but of course profits come from a whole different range of things including i may say the interest on investments <e>", "<cs> my lords the major hold-up is that at the beginning the post office workers refused to operate the machinery <e> <s> i am glad to say that this is now getting considerably better <e> <s> the implementation of the entire outward sorting will be completed by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already done

hope it is indicative for the passage of this measure through its later stages in the house <e> <s> i feel that noble lords have been unusually gentle with me today but even so i should like to comment on as many as possible of the points which have been raised in the debate <e> <s> for example i am most grateful for the opening words of the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> however i would say that he misunderstood my phrase in the time available <e> <s> i mean that in the context of todays debate i was not referring to any other stage which the bill may or may not have <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord graham would allow me to make my speech in my own way i think he will find the enlightenment that obviously he is seeking <e> <s> i was going on to say that there is no need to

and capitalised repairs <e> <s> in general per cent <e> <s> of the loan charges on capitalised repairs improvements and redevelopment count towards an authoritys subsidy entitlement <e> <s> secondly we have said repeatedly that special needs for expenditure of this kind are being taken into account in deciding the hip allocations of the authorities concerned <e> <s> it is for each local authority in its responsible role as landlord to decide in the light of this and its other priorities how it should spend its allocation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords question because it explains the framework of his thinking on this bill <e> <s> the noble lord starts from a false premise <e> <s> he asks me what would happen if the local authorities were suddenly faced with this problem <e> <s> i have been at pains to stress that they are not suddenly going to be pesented with this problem with their own stock or indeed with private stock and i shall go on to explain that in a minute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is pre-empting me again <e>", "<cs> it obviously is a pre-emption right my lords <e> <s> if the statutory criteria were met it would be possible for the local authority to exercise its discretion to help owners in respect of those houses <e> <s> that i think answers the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords shortly is shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords without the information one does not know what question to ask <e> <s> but since noble lords on all sides of the house are briefed by outside advisers i do not think that there will be any difficulty in their coming up with the right question which may or may not be extremely difficult for me to answer at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until five minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is widespread agreement that a staff commission will be an essential part of this reorganisation just as in other previous reorganisations in the words of <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to respond to that <e> <s> yes the noble lord lord graham is perfectly right in saying that it will he for the staff commission to decide <e> <s> but i can see absolutely no reason and nor i am sure will any of my ministerial colleagues why they should not decide in the way that the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that amendment no <e> <s> is also to be taken at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both my noble friends but before commenting on what they have just said perhaps i may bring us back to the amendments on the marshalled list which seek in various ways and to various extents to constrain the secretary of states power to make directions under subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords like it or not and the opposition obviously do not we are still considering a paving bill designed to make interim provisions leading up to the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan county councils and the transfer of functions to the lower tier <e> <s> as part of these measures clause will help to prevent unnecessary waste of time money and effort <e> <s> it does not prevent useful and worthwhile work from continuing and it most certainly does not prejudge abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i must tell the noble lord lord stallard that this amendment is not consistent with government <e>", "<cs> i should like to start by conveying the committees regards to the noble baroness lady fisher and regretting that on this of all subjects she is not here to join us in our deliberations today <e> <s> i should also like to make the general point that the government as represented on this occasion by myself have no horror at all of consultations with the local authorities <e> <s> i do not want to make political points on this subject any more than the noble lord lord graham does but i have said before and i am quite ready to say it again that we are prepared to consult on any occasion with anybody who wants to consult with us <e>", "<cs> exactly <e> <s> the noble lord has a good memory as well as being able to read <e> <s> i have given examples of what the government have done so far by way of consultation in the preparation of the scheme <e> <s> this illustrates the importance which we attach to the co-operation of all interested parties in the operation of the scheme <e> <s> it is our intention to continue along the path we have already taken in this respect <e> <s> i cannot give an absolute categorical assurance that there will be discussion with all parties on every aspect of a particular designation simply because there are occasions when central government not only can move with the speed of light but actually do move with the speed of light <e> <s> it might well be appropriate to have a special urgent designation where there simply is not time for consultations <e> <s> however apart from that consultations will continue to be entered into <e>", "<cs> the noble lords are quite right <e> <s> we can justify at the moment only types to which i have already referred but the bill is deliberately drawn wide enough to include others if necessary <e> <s> the other side of the committee have asked how do we know that funds will be available for this purpose <e> <s> i have explained already that hip funds cannot be made available until there is a planned expenditure by local authorities not before then will the matter be considered and will my honourable friend the minister for housing take it to his other government colleagues <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord really did mishear me <e> <s> i said that we can justify only types at the moment but that the bill is deliberately drawn wide enough to include others if necessary <e> <s> i did not mention a figure not one not not <e>", "<cs> the amendment in itself would be of little benefit for the purpose which the noble lord lord graham has in mind and he explained it to the committee <e> <s> it would if accepted make only very few local authority tenants eligible for assistance under the bill those who are secure tenants and who fulfil the conditions of clause of the bill <e> <s> there are probably very few such cases but it is possible for them to arise in the case for instance of certain leases terminable on death where the tenants have not purchased their interests <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that it is not the governments intention to encourage the re-acquisition by the public sector of houses sold into the private sector <e> <s> i am sure that it is right that wherever possible these houses should remain in the private sector that is what the great majority of owners will want provided that they can be sure that when repaired their houses will be saleable at full value and hence become mortgageable for the new owners <e> <s> we have therefore decided that the main form of assistance under the bill should be grant-aided towards the cost of reinstating the defective dwellings wherever the dwellings concerned can be satisfactorily repaired <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can encapsulate the answers that were given on this subject in another place because i understand that it is somewhat complicated <e> <s> the rule about direct labour organisations is that they can do anything which the local authority has power to do itself <e> <s> this bill gives them the power to operate under certain circumstances <e> <s> therefore if the circumstances are fulfilled the direct labour organisation in the case cited by the noble lord can do the work <e>", "<cs> whenever one moves house whether from a rented dwelling to a rented dwelling from a rented dwelling to an owned dwelling or vice versa costs are inevitably incurred <e> <s> the consequential costs mentioned by the noble lord lord graham are not included in this bill because it would be unfair to do so <e> <s> on this occasion it is unfair to the local authority to do this at the expense of other occupiers of property whether owner-occupiers or tenants who would not have the same resource to draw upon <e>", "<cs> to cut my response short the question at issue is whether the secretary of state should contribute towards the cost of repurchasing dwellings designated locally under clause <e> <s> the question is the proper balance of responsibility <e> <s> the power of local authorities to make local designation under clause is designed to enable them to give assistance to owners who have bought dwellings which are now found to be defective by reason of design or construction faults that are peculiar to dwellings in that authoritys area or in the area of only a few authorities in other words where there is no national problem <e> <s> it must follow that those faults are the results of decisions taken at a local level as to the design or methods of construction of particular dwellings <e> <s> in those circumstances it is right in principle that the costs of giving assistance to owners to help them with consequences of those local decisions or practices should be borne locally and should not fall on the central taxpayer <e> <s> it is this principle that is reflected in clauses and in the bill as drafted <e> <s> i do not think that we should depart from it <e>", "<cs> this is an issue which occurs in practically every bill which comes before your lordships albeit in not quite such a form <e> <s> i remember in the past having voted on such bills as the bees bill to turn may into shall and i am sure we shall be doing the same sort of thing again <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> i am reminded of pooh who always wanted more honey of oliver twist who asked for more and of the young girl who went home and assured her mother that she had not gone all the way <e> <s> so far as a fee to local authorities is concerned which was raised by my noble friend lord sandford this would involve a precedent which i have a feeling local authorities themselves would not like in other parts of their relationship between local and central government <e> <s> so it might be appropriate at this moment if we left the discussion there <e>", "<cs> i have already given half of the assurance for which the noble lord was looking on a previous amendment <e> <s> i can assure the committee that the government have no intention of reducing the percentage contribution from that stated on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> to save time perhaps i might say ditto <e>", "<cs> there is really very little if anything that i can add on housing investment <e>", "<cs> yes but what i was saying was that if the local authorities go too far along that road as the balance if one likes there will have to be a direction from central government that the local authority will at the end of the day spend that money on those particular projects <e> <s> it is that which i suggest is not in the interests of local authorities <e> <s> but i take the point that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord that the first alterations that may be necessary to hips are already under discussion <e> <s> indeed the few dwellings that will be involved in the remaining months up to st april have already been taken into account in setting this years hips so we are in advance of the situation that he warns us of <e>", "<cs> i must say i am rather surprised by the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> it is so uncharacteristic of him <e> <s> it is sniping at a small section of those people who have exercised their right to buy which has been given to them after i should be the first to admit quite a struggle in debates in parliament on two occasions in and again this year <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained although not quite so specifically as i shall clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord at the last moment of tonights committee stage has hit upon a very complicated problem <e> <s> i hope therefore that he will not mind if i spend a little time on my answer <e> <s> the purpose of part ii of schedule is to ensure that an interest in land acquired by an appropriate authority is unencumbered by any charge typically a mortgage to which that interest was subject immediately before its acquisition <e> <s> many of the dwellings acquired in pursuance of clause will be mortgaged <e> <s> some bought under the right to buy will also be subject to a charge to secure the repayment of discount <e> <s> where an interest in land subject to a mortgage or other charge is being sold there are two possibilities either the mortgagee or the chargee can release that interest from the charge on payment of the sum due before the sale takes place or the interest passes to the new owner subject to the mortgage or charge which binds the interest in the hands of the new owner <e>", "<cs> my lords the public inquiry provided a full opportunity for the investigation of the proposal and the secretary of state is confident that the inspectors report will provide him with an account of all the relevant arguments for and against it <e> <s> he has no reason to depart from the normal procedure of publishing the report with his decision <e> <s> in short the answer to my noble friends question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is not convinced that this is an issue of national importance in the way that the windscale inquiry for example was <e> <s> if my right honourable friend were to publish the inspectors report before reaching his decision that would merely encourage those who disagree with the inspectors conclusion to seek to reopen the argument <e> <s> it would in turn require all parties to the public inquiry to be given the opportunity to comment on any new evidence produced <e> <s> since there has already been held a wide-ranging public local inquiry at which it was open to anyone to seek to give evidence my right honourable friend sees no justification for a further public debate that might in turn lead to a reopening of the public inquiry with all the delays that would be involved <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is of course one of the points that will have been taken into account by the inspector <e> <s> all of us will read with interest what he has to say on the matter when the report is finally published after my right honourable friend has made his decision <e> <s> when i talked about matters of national importance i meant of course in the planning context <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the least idea of the answer to that question <e> <s> my noble friend may be right or he may be wrong <e> <s> i am quite convinced that the answer to it will be found in the inspectors report <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord might be absolutely correct <e> <s> we shall await the inspectors report with interest <e> <s> if my right honourable friend were to publish the report before coming to a decision on the matter that would in effect produce an appeal against the inspectors recommendation <e> <s> that again would be an undesirable precedent with repercussions on our entire planning system <e> <s> i remain unconvinced of the justification for proceeding in any other way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i accept of course that the theatre at stratford-on-avon is of international importance <e> <s> but this was one of the factors that led my right honourable friend although he had no need to do so because the site in question is crown land to set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has misunderstood what i said earlier <e> <s> what i said was that although there was no statutory need for a planning inquiry my right honourable friend thought that a planning inquiry was appropriate in this case <e> <s> the planning inquiry has now been held and my right honourable friend is awaiting the inspectors report <e> <s> as to the technical matters to which the noble lord referred yes evidence to that effect was given at the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already referred briefly in a previous answer to windscale <e> <s> but the sizewell inquiry is of course still in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that my noble friend has put forward a point of view with which i must confess i do not agree <e> <s> i should have thought that the logic of the tenor of the questions both today and when i answered a similar question a fortnight or so ago is that the house either does not trust the objectors to present their case thoroughly or does not trust the inspector to make a fair report or as a last resort does not trust my right honourable friend to come to the correct conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps he can exercise his powers of persuasion continuously rather than just on the original occasion <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think it is right for me to reconsider the answer i gave earlier because what i was saying was that with that logic as <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the rules of the house that anyone speaking from this dispatch box speaks for the government as a whole <e> <s> but it is not generally recognised i believe that i hold the job which the committee of the noble lord lord greenhill is in part of its report calling for in that i am a spokesman both for the maff and the doe simultaneously <e> <s> i accept of course that i have a minimal role in policy formation but nonetheless my role is to present both sides of the argument which becomes more like quicksand every day it seems <e> <s> listening to the ups and downs of this debate i think that that remark which i penned some hours ago is probably correct <e> <s> i see myself a little like mercy on top of the royal courts of justice with a balance that moves in that it goes up and down <e> <s> that is what the weight of argument occasionally on the side of agricultural interests and occasionally on the side of environmental interests should do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is the time of night to get into an argument with the noble lord <e> <s> i would however say that it is very difficult to understand how he reconciles the two approaches that he has just adumbrated <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed it might <e> <s> this is something which i believe both of my right honourable friends would do well to look into <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was trying to do was to make the point that we are not seeing the undermining of the voluntary approach of the wildlife and countryside act but reinforcement was built into that act <e> <s> i accept that article was not the reinforcement that was envisaged in that act <e> <s> as the house well knows it would be the section arrangements <e> <s> i think i am right if not i shall have to correct that <e> <s> there must be to any kind of act of this nature some type of back-up powers <e> <s> i do not particularly like using them but i can confirm that when they are necessary they will be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that all second reading speeches were constructed and delivered as well as that of the noble lord lord stallard in moving this amendment <e> <s> i make no complaint about this because he has a major point to make on the financing of this sector of local government expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords that is fair comment <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords and to the noble lord lord stallard who has not spoken in this very short debate for their constructive attitude towards the government and for being behind the purposes of this bill <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord graham who said at committee stage that i did not go all the way with them <e> <s> but noble lords know perfectly well that i would have been shot if i had <e> <s> however the points made at the last moment by my noble friend lord sandford are very well taken <e>", "<cs> my lords in the european regional development fund made a grant of to strengthen the structure of the victorian pier at southport <e> <s> more recently the eec cultural fund approved a grant for a feasibility study of repair to brighton west pier <e>", "<cs> my lords the interference of the european parliament is i would have thought a matter for them but rather like some public bodies close at home the commission have only recently discovered piers <e> <s> they are being as generous as they can be bearing in mind that of course they have responsibilities for the whole of the european economic community <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am very well aware of that <e> <s> there has also been a certain amount of pressure on this subject from the council of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords nonsense like other things probably lies in the eye of the beholder <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid it is not a very lucrative source <e> <s> about european currency units are involved for projects spread among the entire community <e> <s> the grant of referred to in my original answer was for a feasibility study and i have no doubt that when that has been completed a further application to the fund will be put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that if applied for it could but this would be routed by the historic buildings and monuments commission for england <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be the appropriate moment to have a break in our proceedings <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord elton i beg to move that the further proceedings after third reading of the bill be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only two months since the act came into force and the rules affecting housing for the disabled were extensively debated during the bills passage <e> <s> the government will of course monitor the acts operation but i believe it is too soon to promise a review of the new provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the case of mrs strudwick to which my noble friend refers but i should point out that for the first time the act gives the automatic right to buy to those disabled people who have had minor adaptations made to their homes so in general the disabled are better off than they were before <e> <s> however i accept that this does not go as far as my noble friend would like <e> <s> this is highlighted by the unfortunate case of mrs strudwick <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite correct the act does not remove the right to buy from disabled people whose homes have been extensively adapted because that right did not exist at the beginning <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot help the house about the number of dwellings involved as i do not have the figures in front of me <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall correct my noble friend slightly in that the figure is square metres but as to the substantive point she is making yes that is quite correct <e> <s> but the government and i see no reason why once the iron lung has been taken out of the premises the house should not revert to normal housing stock <e> <s> however as i said at the beginning we had a substantial and extensive debate on this and i do not think that this is the occasion to pursue the matter any further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i was well aware of the point that my noble friend made <e> <s> but as i said at the beginning of my speech it is not for me this evening to put out the governments view on any particular aspect of the report <e> <s> for my own part i can see no reason why we should not agree with the thames water authority on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the motion is put i am afraid that i was a little slow on the uptake the first time round <e> <s> this motion is to take note of the report so this motion should be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords the percentage and value of water put into supply which is unaccounted for principally because of leakage vary widely from place to place <e> <s> a survey in put this figure at approximately per cent <e> <s> for the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> however in some areas the figure can be much higher <e>", "<cs> my lords there are about miles of undertakers mains and a similar length of supply pipes in the ownership of consumers in england and wales <e> <s> therefore there will always be a certain amount of leakage <e> <s> what one has to ascertain is at what point it ceases to become cost-effective to repair this leakage <e> <s> as to my noble friends question on the budget of water authorities yes the budget is approved in each case by my right honourable friend the secretary of state and for those procedures which the water authorities themselves wish to carry out there is sufficient money <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships select committee on science and technology in reported on the future of the water industry and took up in some detail this question of water leakage <e> <s> i would refer the noble lord to what they say and to what was the governments response <e> <s> the government have been in contact with the water authorities to set under way new and improved measures to reduce water leakage and these are being <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that that were entirely so <e> <s> but of course there is an uptake by plants and it finds its way into rivers and so down into the sea <e> <s> it also finds its way into ponds

get any information they require out of the water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> the water research centre has been at the centre of producing the new machines such as the leak/noise correlator to which my noble friend has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends upon whether they are h <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but

congratulating the noble lord lord irving on being able to persuade the usual channels that this unstarred question should be debated today <e> <s> i know that the noble lord started his niggling on

lord saying that it is complete information on the subject <e> <s> i rather doubt it <e> <s> but perhaps i may be allowed to go on with my speech after that exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the report of your lordships committee on science and technology the government have been encouraging water authorities and their agents to concentrate surveys on sewers in critical areas so that remedial works can be planned in the most cost-effective way <e> <s> the authorities are using the most up-to-date techniques developed by the water research centre in collaboration with the construction industry to further this work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to answer my noble friends first supplementary by giving the same assurance but in rather different words as i did a month or so ago <e> <s> investment takes account of the needs identified in the water authorities corporate plans and this year investment in sewerage by the water authorities will be million <e> <s> they themselves plan to increase it to million per annum over the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords the

question between events that may or may not have occurred yesterday in another place and the statement my noble friend lord avon made yesterday <e> <s> the governments policy is to improve employment by creating long-term jobs <e> <s> we are being very successful at this <e> <s> two hundred and fifty thousand new jobs were created this year alone <e> <s> the opposition policy as i understand it is to massage the figures to take people for short terms off the dole <e> <s> in my view this policy would be a mere flash in the pan <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary the money is found by the water authorities and identified in their annual corporate plans <e> <s> the sewerage arrangements are such that different contracts exist between different agents <e> <s> for example in london as my noble friend has just mentioned different contracts exist between the water authority and the different london districts and i would expect that this is the principal reason behind my noble friends concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my mind is not quick enough to translate into percentages the figures that i gave in answer to an earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that a debt which this money is although it is a debt owing to the national loans board could never be described as a loan <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is in cash terms but it is actually more money in real terms <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot do that <e> <s> what i can tell the house is that there are about miles of public sewers in england and wales and some collapses a year <e> <s> put another way there is one collapse for every miles of sewer <e> <s> this means that the average urban street might suffer a sewer collapse once in years <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is none of them <e> <s> i can give the assurance that it will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to provide the thousands of jobs for which the noble lord has asked in this respect it would mean digging up vast amounts of our roads both country roads and those in our conurbations <e> <s> in my view the traffic and pedestrian upset that that would cause would prove to be totally unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just spent a small amount of money cleaning out my own septic tank and i am very happy with this example of government philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord soames <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is not about septic tanks but about the sewerage system <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think i can

by commercial interests and are being manufactured and sold to anglers a tungsten-based polymer and a tacky rubber-based powdered steel mixture <e> <s> the latter is volume for volume the same price

go on to say that we shall not hesitate to use legislation if it proves necessary <e> <s> however we all very much hope that a voluntary approach which is the governments approach to conservation in general will be adequate in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the conditions on that particular water but nonetheless more swans are at risk from lead shot than from any other cause <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a long list of supplementary questions and i am not sure that i followed the noble lords last point <e> <s> however of course i stand by the answer of my noble friend lord avon to the written question put by the noble lord lord houghton in october last which is what i sought to explain in reply to an earlier supplementary <e> <s> to turn to the three pieces of legislation to which the noble lord referred i do not have them before me but so far as i know they will be totally unusuable in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is pressing me to give figures for the deaths of swans on the thames during the past three to five years or whenever i am afraid that i am not in a position so to do <e> <s> i am well aware that there is significant cause for concern especially in the upper reaches of the thames <e> <s> the noble lords other point was whether voluntary conversion if that is the word would work <e> <s> these products have been available on the market only since june last year <e> <s> as such they have had only one fishing season in which to prove their worth <e> <s> anglers are by nature a rather conservative body of sportsmen and i do not think that it is reasonable for the noble lord to expect this sort of approach to work overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that unless the voluntary arrangements are fully operational by and proving successful the government will not hesitate to legislate on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was specifically asked about figures for the thames which i said i did not have <e> <s> however i am informed by the nature conservancy council that its information is that there were deaths to cygnets or swans in the past three years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but not the same figure as for the thames which i said i was unable to answer <e> <s> as regards the box which dispenses lead shot individually yes it does exist it is on sale to anglers and anglers have been purchasing it <e> <s> however i am unable to tell the noble baroness in what kind of quantities <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> however they have regulatory functions in relation to river quality which set them apart from the more typical nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords under the water acts and water authorities are subject to ministerial appointment powers of ministerial direction and financial controls of the same kind as are other nationalised industries <e> <s> they are treated as nationalised industries for the purposes of public expenditure controls and financial monitoring <e> <s> so far as the consultation paper involving my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer is concerned i am afraid that i can give the noble baroness no information <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that i am talking about water authorities in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the way it has been done heretofore but as i and my noble friend lord avon have made clear on numerous occasions recently it is a charge for water <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not believe that that is happening <e> <s> what is happening is that todays consumers are being asked to reduce the debts which water authorities have brought forward from historical times <e> <s> with regard to the suggestion that water charges are a tax i have consistently made it clear that there is no tax element involved that water has a cost based on collection storage and delivery and that this cost is what comes in the water rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend he is of course quite right <e> <s> last years average rate of return for water authorities in england and wales was per cent <e> <s> this year it is intended that it should be per cent next year per cent <e> <s> and in per cent <e> <s> if you compare those figures with for example the per cent <e> <s> for major non-oil industrial and commercial companies the return in the water industry will remain extremely low <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord grimond is trying to scotch the argument as to whether or not it is a tax then i would say that surely the point at issue is whether the money raised should come from taxpayers as a whole or from water users <e> <s> it is the governments view that it should come from water users <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not yet in a position of knowing what extra charges there will be because the water authorities will not be deciding until march upon the charges they will be making within the financial limitations laid down by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> so far as the consumer consultative committees are concerned my right honourable friend receives the reports though they are made in the first instance to the water authority concerned <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i find that particularly difficult to understand given that he was the chief executive of british airways which has a per cent <e> <s> rate of return <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply cannot gree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and so we are frequently told <e> <s> in fact i am going to northampton tomorrow to inspect the sewers there <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord wallace has said <e> <s> i observe that he has again taken careful note of what i said at second reading <e> <s> i thank him for that <e> <s> he must appreciate however that he is placing both the government and perhaps more importantly the committee at considerable difficulty by the withdrawal of clauses and of the bill to which he spoke at second reading <e> <s> when this new clause is passed as i am sure it will be the noble lord will have a bill which is more than slightly different from the one that he presented <e> <s> so i appreciate the dilemma of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord avon i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will consider that it is appropriate to return to the second reading of the mineral workings bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be the first to concede that a commitment by one government is not binding on a successor government <e> <s> most certainly i shall undertake as i thought i had already to consider and read most carefully the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that nothing would be beyond the wit of the usual channels but the usual channels did not consider the noble lords point <e> <s> if he had been in a position to make it earlier no doubt it would have been considered <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk asked about crown land as it might or might not be affected by the provisions of this bill <e> <s> i have to tell her that crown land is outside the scope of the bill because it would be necessary to look at each case on crown land if and when it arises but it is likely that the spirit of the bill will be followed in any case <e> <s> it would sometimes i suggest to her be difficult to justify a power of compulsory entry to such as defence or prison lands <e> <s> i see that the noble baroness is nodding and i think that perhaps she understands that <e>", "<cs> my lords the only undertaking i was giving was to consider any point that the noble <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be an appropriate moment to break <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace has made himself crystal clear as does this amendment <e> <s> i am very happy that he should have listened to the advice which as he knows very well was passed through me from other sources <e>", "<cs> my lords since the water authorities were established in their financial framework has been akin to that of other nationalised industries <e> <s> they have been treated as nationalised industries for purposes of public expenditure control and financial monitoring since march <e> <s> this accorded with the governments statement at the time in another place of their plans to improve the nationalised industries efficiency and performance <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as assets are concerned in the water authorities took over the assets under the old local government arrangements at nil value <e> <s> in reply to the last part of the supplementary question of the noble baroness the water authorities are being asked to produce a real rate of return on current cost accounting principles which compares with the electricity supply industry of per cent <e> <s> and with per cent <e> <s> for british gas <e>", "<cs> my lords water may be an inflammatory subject in wales but it is certainly not an inflammatory commodity <e> <s> i can confirm the special relationship between the welsh water authority and the secretary of state but the government are united that it is one policy <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities have wide powers to protect those living in houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> these should be used in the light of local knowledge <e> <s> the department of the environment is currently carrying out research into the condition of these houses and local authorities use of legislation <e> <s> the need for further measures will be examined in the light of the outcome of that research <e>", "<cs> my lords while i would not rule out future legislation on this issue the government would not be justified in considering the need for it until we have a clear picture after the research project to which i referred has been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that the research to which i have just referred is in two parts the first part is a postal survey which will provide information about the number type and condition of hmos and about the local authorities use of their powers <e> <s> the second part involves visiting a range of hmos <e> <s> this will provide detailed information about conditions the possible costs and the rehousing implications in dealing with those conditions where it is necessary as well as information about the residents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i must tell my noble friend that those statistics are not available to me at the moment <e> <s> i doubt that they are available centrally because this is the responsibility of the local authority <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i accept the tragic figures which the noble lord has underlined in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> the second part of his supplementary question referred to extending the housing means of escape from fire in houses in multiple occupation order no <e> <s> <e> <s> we considered this very carefully <e> <s> we concluded that local authorities can exercise existing powers whenever they consider it appropriate to do so <e> <s> extending the order would have imposed an unnecessary burden on local authorities to use those powers in respect of hmos which they had already decided did not merit action under schedule to the housing act <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am bowled by both those supplementary questions <e> <s> so far as i know the english national housing survey does not give details of houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> i shall have to let the noble lord know the answer to his second supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are afoot discussions as to what might be done in regard to health and social security in this area but i do not think that i ought to anticipate any outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is that water authorities should earn a rate of return which is reasonable on a level of investment adequate to meet their own needs <e> <s> the external finance limit follows from that and it can be either positive or negative <e> <s> the latter situation arises in industries where outstanding debt is low compared with their assets so that interest payments absorb little of the internally generated cash <e> <s> as regards who is to get the money that remains to be seen but it certainly will not be the treasury <e> <s> in the event that it comes into public ownership it will of course be the exchequer as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords that remains to be seen but what i said was that if the money comes outside the authority it will of course be the exchequer as a whole and not the treasury <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is certainly not <e> <s> the chairman of the thames water authority has no doubt in the matter <e> <s> in his introduction to his first annual report which was published on th october last he said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in order to get a reasonable rate of return on the thames water authoritys assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very hard to follow the argument of the noble lord lord bruce on double standards when each of the current water authority chairmen knew full well when they were last appointed that current cost accounting would be observed in their industry <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of my noble friends supplementary question she put her finger squarely on the relative point <e> <s> in this country by law anybody who wishes to have a metered supply can have a metered supply <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge and belief it is not correct <e> <s> if my noble friend will give me details i shall take this up with the thames water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have to inform the noble lord that he asked his supplementary question from a wrong premise <e> <s> so far as current cost accounting is concerned <e>", "<cs> i shall get to historic cost in a minute if the house will allow me <e> <s> but so far as current cost accounting is concerned the thames water authority has a return of per cent <e> <s> marks and spencer has not published its return and ici has per cent thames water is low <e> <s> under historic cost however thames water has a return of per cent <e> <s> marks and spencer per cent <e> <s> and ici per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords british industry as a whole has valued assets properly and not at the written down or zero costs which pertain in the water industry <e> <s> that is the difference <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i would agree and i do not think that it can be a good thing for the morale and the general standing of relations between the government and nationalised industry chairmen as a whole <e>", "<cs> no my lords certainly not <e> <s> in the water industry we have the consumer consultative committees which are fully informed and which discuss these matters with the relevant water authority boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not responsible for the questions i am asked only for the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord avon i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord lloyd for explaining his amendment so clearly <e> <s> i rather thought at one stage that he was going to deal with all three of his amendments together but i understand he is dealing with the first and the third <e> <s> in essence he asks whether buildings are included with land so far as the compensation and other provisions of the bill are concerned <e> <s> the answer is yes because as regards this bill we have to go back to the national parks and access to the countryside act <e>", "<cs> just to put the record straight may i say that there is no misprint in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is arguing for compensation to be paid in respect of any depreciation in the value of the land caused by the powers given in clause of the bill <e> <s> that would bring the clause into line with the provisions of clause <e> <s> i sought to quell the noble lords anxieties on second reading in columns and of the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord kilgerran presses this matter perhaps i have not made myself clear <e> <s> of course there is compensation for damage negligence and matters of that nature <e> <s> and if the local authority were to break into a house and had to smash a lock or splinter a door with an axe then of course compensation would be paid <e>", "<cs> but i cannot see in what circumstances depreciation would arise in this particular case <e> <s> as i said earlier the power under clause is to enter the premises but not to undertake the works and a survey is most unlikely to cause long-term depreciation of the land <e> <s> indeed the whole object of the exercise is to improve the value of the land and not depreciate it <e> <s> the power to undertake reclamation work in clause includes depreciation as a compensatable factor <e> <s> in those parts of the bill where it really matters this provision is already included <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure whether this is in fact an amendment probing the governments intentions or whether it is real but i should like to proceed with the committees permission by assuming that it is a bit of both <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the noble lord lord beswick should take that attitude <e> <s> on the point of consultations he most certainly misunderstood me <e> <s> what i said was that consultations on the bill have already taken place <e> <s> they have been very wide <e> <s> therefore it is possible to have an early introduction of the bill <e> <s> however consultations should they be needed on the new clause of the noble baroness have not been held which is the reason why i would counsel a delay in introducing the new clause beyond i think it is st april as proposed by amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes there are pending consultations which i referred to i think in the opening paragraph of my response to the noble <e>", "<cs> no i think that it would be unreasonable to do that in any event <e> <s> but what i was saying was that consultations on the problem to which the noble lord has drawn our attention are going on at the moment but they will be incomplete consultations until such time as the mineral operators and the landowners have also been included within the consultation process <e>", "<cs> quite honestly i think i have answered as fully as i am able to at this particular time <e> <s> i have been asked whether consultations are going on and the answer is yes <e> <s> i have been asked about various matters <e> <s> all i can add to what i have already said is to tell the committee a little about the regulations though of course they have not yet been published and i am under a certain amount of difficulty so far as this goes <e> <s> it is intended that the regulations will provide for the abatement in certain circumstances of the amount of compensation which a mineral planning authority is obliged to pay in respect of loss or damage arising from an order made by the authority under part iii of the act to amend an extant minerals planning permission <e> <s> such orders may for example revoke or modify a permission require the discontinuance of mineral working prohibit the resumption of mining operations which have ceased or impose requirements in relation to a site where mining operations are temporarily suspended <e> <s> as i have said this is not the complete story because we do not have the regulations in front of us <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the district valuer has suggested that it would cost million in compensation if they were all to be revoked <e> <s> but it is by no means clear that they are all unacceptable even in todays terms <e> <s> therefore i would most certainly query the figure of million <e> <s> so far as rate capping is concerned and the question of whether the local authority would be able to find any money for such compensation which is really what the noble baroness is asking compensation is calculated and is funded in a variety of ways and sometimes in particular circumstances as i understand it involves central government <e> <s> whether this would be so in that particular case i do not know and i am sure that this is one of the matters with which the consultations will be concerned <e>", "<cs> the answer is no because during the consultations the government will not be in a position to make a final agreement for the reasons that i have already given to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes i most certainly give that assurance <e> <s> i have no doubt that my honourable friend will take full cognisance of what has been stated by the noble lord lord beswick by the noble baroness lady nicol and by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran during this short debate <e> <s> i cannot however give an assurance as to the effect that this will have on the final outcome of the discussions or whether it will affect the subsequent proceedings on the bill <e>", "<cs> we might have been talking at cross-purposes <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it has nothing at all to do with amendment no <e> <s> so far as i can see <e>", "<cs> absolutely <e> <s> i was not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness asks why paragraph <e>", "<cs> it occurs to me having had a few seconds peace from the flak of the last half hour or so that what i am about to say may help considerably your lordships future consideration and discussion on the last amendment <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to protect mineral planning authorities from having to pay compensation in the event of their deciding to exercise powers under sections and of the town and country planning act to modify an old ironstone permission to impose conditions requiring restoration and after-care of the site when extraction is completed <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i think the point here is that had the ironstone not been there these particular permissions that we are talking about would not have been granted in the first place <e> <s> i accept that ancillary to the ironstone permissions there are permissions to extract for other minerals particularly limestone <e> <s> i am not sure that this gets us any further but i should say that of course where those conditions for other minerals apply then that is what we are talking about now that the ironstone extraction no longer goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords we live in hard times both in the weather and in the economy <e> <s> as your lordships will know it has been my constant theme throughout the debates on this bill and its <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shackleton <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord avon i beg to move that this report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for those few words of comfort from the noble baroness <e> <s> as she knows but the house does not i promised to report as soon as practicable after the meeting on th march which incidentally is to be held in northampton and not in london as the noble baroness will welcome <e> <s> i hope to do this by the evening of the following day but if i am fractionally late i hope that the noble baroness will excuse me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether the noble lord has spoken to amendment no <e> <s> as well as introducing amendment no <e> <s> and is speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it strikes me that he might just as well have made the second part of his speech on amendment no <e> <s> as on the first two <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> nonetheless before saying what i have to say on the first two amendments i should point out two general facts <e> <s> the first is that clause and indeed clause which to some extent reflects on clause but not entirely apply only to compulsory entry and compulsory undertaking of works <e> <s> in other words if they are freely undertaken with the agreement of the owner or occupier by the council these two clauses in the bill do not apply in any event <e> <s> it follows from that that a land owner who lets the council on to his land by agreement would be well advised to have already come to terms with the council on the question of compensation including if he thinks fit possible depreciation <e> <s> however as i have said we are not dealing with that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may be allowed to answer my noble friend <e> <s> with regard to his first point on whether the bill should refer to section of the derelict land act my understanding is that the normal method of drafting in such cases is to refer to the original act in this case the national parks and access to the countryside act <e> <s> so what we are in fact doing is employing standard words for a given situation <e> <s> so far as my noble friends other point is concerned <e> <s> i have i hope a few minutes in which to consider it and i should like to come back to the charge when we discuss amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for explaining his amendment so clearly <e> <s> i must say that he has raised this point consistently at every stage of the bill and also in correspondence and i have obviously not yet been able to satisfy his concern <e> <s> that concern is that in his view it is possible that such works as local authorities are permitted to undertake under clause and i have already explained in answer to his previous amendments that these are very small could result in a loss of value being caused to the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that i said that they would be small operations <e> <s> the noble lord refers to excavators mine-filling equipment and goodness knows what else <e> <s> however we are not talking about clause we are not concerned with that here because the noble lords amendment is to clause <e> <s> what i said on clause was that it would be a temporary phenomenon yes he is quite right because the only power that is given is to enter and survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to explain at report stage why the bill is properly drafted in this respect <e> <s> if the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran can pray in aid my absent noble friend lord renton so can i he would i am sure agree with me that the position is that section of the national parks and access to the countryside act contains the specific power which local authorities have to treat derelict land or land which may become derelict as a result of collapse of the surface due to the carrying out of former underground mineral workings <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd for deciding to take these three amendments together <e> <s> they are of course different in substance but as he has explained they have but a single thought underlying them <e> <s> i must say so far as amendment no <e> <s> goes that the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will ask the leave of the house to do so i have no doubt that he will receive it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for that further explanation of his point <e> <s> i was saying that the noble lord has asked for the three amendments to be discussed together but perhaps i may preface my remarks by making it quite clear that i do not regard people who drop aitches as either uneducated or unintelligent <e> <s> i would normally expect a local authoritys surveillance of land to ascertain its state or the effect on it of works carried out to take less than a month <e> <s> however even here there will no doubt be the odd occasion when more time is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has been most persistent on this point throughout the various stages of the bill in this house <e> <s> the noble lord said and i think i quote him correctly that i have made his case for him <e> <s> if that is so perhaps we have both scored own-goals and i shall try again <e> <s> it is clear that my arguments have failed to satisfy the noble lord and i must explain again in some detail how i see the compensation elements of this clause working <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will be fair enough to say that my answers also have contained different words <e> <s> in the disappointing circumstances and i say disappointing because it will inevitably mean that negotiations to exercise the functions under the national parks and access to the countryside act have failed in that the owner or occupier cannot be traced or is otherwise uncooperative that a local authority decides it has to use the powers in clause to enter and to survey land it will do so because it fears that the stability of the ground is doubtful due to the existence of former underground mineral workings and it wishes to ascertain what treatment if any will be necessary to make the land safe <e> <s> in the case which the noble lord has just mentioned i would of course go along with him totally so far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can agree with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that the debates which we have had on the bill serve very well to illustrate the excellent job which this house can do when it comes to ensuring not just that all new legislation will achieve its purpose but also that those who might be affected by its provisions will receive equitable treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no statutory requirement for allotment authorities to maintain any allotment records <e> <s> each is free to decide for itself whether and in what form such records are kept <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether or not the figures on the piece of paper held out to your lordships by the noble lord lord wallace just now and which i have not seen are correct <e> <s> if they are of course there is no need for me to answer this question <e> <s> however as far as the noble lords first supplementary goes i should expect authorities to keep records of the area of their allotment gardens and waiting lists of the people who apply for allotments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the way in which the noble lord lord graham has phrased this supplementary question <e> <s> however i have already made it quite clear what records i should expect local authorities to keep in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are always concerned to ensure that all those in the building industry fully comply with their statutory duties <e> <s> however assuming that the noble lords concern in asking this question is fiscal her majestys government are deploying more staff and simplifying the system to reduce tax evasion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i fully agree with the noble lord <e> <s> tax evasion is a very serious problem <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we are taking steps to deal with it <e> <s> in the past two years an extra staff have been redeployed by the customs and excise and in the period from to approximately additional revenue staff will have been redeployed in local tax offices the paye audit force and the boards investigation office on anti-evasion work to combat the black economy which as i said is a very serious problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am most certainly ready to praise the work of the national housebuilding council and the government are fully <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the customs officers to whom i referred are extra staff whereas the additional inland revenue staff will have come from other posts <e> <s> but the point is that their great knowledge and experience will be brought to bear on this problem in those areas whereas before they were more widely deployed if i may use the word <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pre-empt my right honourable friends budget statement tomorrow but last years budget brought an equalisation of tax effects between vat and other taxes for example income tax and corporation tax so i do not think that the noble lord is right in saying that it was all bad <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of that and it also includes training <e> <s> so far as health and safety are concerned the factory inspectorate deploys about inspectors on construction works <e> <s> they visit sites and head offices of all sizes of construction firms <e> <s> they have substantial powers including powers in magistrates courts against firms and individuals who seriously contravene legal requirements <e> <s> their effort will be continuous especially in the small firm sector where there is a particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no personal estimate but sir lawrence airey has estimated that it is between and per cent <e> <s> of gross domestic product <e> <s> if it was per cent <e> <s> of last years gdp the tax loss on that sum could have been as high as billion <e> <s> the million to which the noble lord lord dean referred is a particular amount for those people who have been dare i use the phrase <e> <s> quasi-identified <e> <s> in other words it is what we actually know is going on <e> <s> the other figures are gross estimates <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is absolutely right <e> <s> by definition the term cowboy means that the people in question are operating outside the law <e> <s> the great worry is that by tightening the law in this respect you will increase the cowboy element <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be appropriate if at this point i intervene to give a very brief indication of the governments view on the instruction <e> <s> while the government have no objection to the bill in principle the powers sought in clause are a matter of concern to my department <e> <s> we have drawn our objections to the attention of the promoters <e> <s> briefly in our opinion the clause generally seeks unprecedented powers to control a planning matter through public health legislation when adequate powers already exist in section of the town and country planning act <e> <s> that section gives a local planning authority the power to impose any condition on the continuance of a use of land <e> <s> moreover clause makes no provision for compensation to be recoverable from the local planning authority such as that which exists in section of the same act <e> <s> depending on the outcome of negotiations with the promoters my department will need to consider in due course whether or not to report to parliament on the clause <e> <s> i therefore support my noble friends instruction to the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to restrict compensation for an adverse planning decision following the making of an article direction in relation to land in a national park <e> <s> the question of article directions was discussed very fully during committee stage and we heard a great deal about the fears of the farming community and the risk that an amendment of this kind would simply provoke a flood of planning applications from landowners in the affected areas who were seeking to beat the months deadline <e> <s> the amendment would be likely to encourage the widespread use of article directions to control development in national parks and this would be a major shift in the present balance between planning authorities landowners and conservation interests <e> <s> the government do not consider that this is the right way to tackle my noble friends problem particularly when there has been no opportunity for consultation and public discussion on the very wide-ranging implications <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps on that note i may respond <e> <s> i recognise the concern of the noble lord about whether months is long enough to submit a planning application following the revocation or modification of a development order relating to agricultural development <e> <s> i have also read and was listening to the debate on this point or a similar one on the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i observe that the noble lord has reduced his level of demand since the committee stage when he asked for the period to be extended to months which i am sure was in the minds of many of my noble friends behind me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord sandford for putting the dilemma squarely before the house <e> <s> i shall of course respond to the last important point that he made a little later <e> <s> my noble friend lord montagu has explained that his amendment no <e> <s> would have the effect of adding a new provision to section of the act and arises from his later amendment no <e> <s> related to the provisions of section of that act <e> <s> he must i am sure be aware especially after his recent meeting with my noble friend lord avon and his officials that although his general concern to enhance the protection of conservation areas is a common thread between the two amendments the application is quite different in each case <e> <s> i am grateful to him for agreeing to treat both his amendments on their own merits <e>", "<cs> my lords this is exactly the point that i sought to answer when referring to the remarks of my noble friend lord dilhorne <e> <s> i shall not believe until evidence is produced it has not yet been produced that this problem is as widespread as has been suggested today by the noble viscount for example <e> <s> we do not have evidence from the local authorities that this is happening and is an abuse which needs to be corrected as a matter of the greatest urgency <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to accept that it is happening in a few cases which have been illustrated today <e> <s> i think it is absolutely vital before we have blanket approaches to any particular problem to actually understand and for parliament to be advised on exactly the strength of the evidence and the widespread need for legislation that that throws up <e>", "<cs> my lords as one unused from this bench to giving assurances i was rather surprised that the assurance i gave earlier was greeted so quietly although obviously it goes some way to relieving certain concerns that have been expressed this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i get the impression that i have been accused of devaluing conservation areas <e> <s> nothing could be further from the truth i assure you <e> <s> i fully accept the importance of protecting buildings in conservation areas <e> <s> incidentally my noble friend lord stanley of alderley was quite right it is all buildings in conservation areas and the amendment would affect compensation for the refusal of an extension to any building in a conservation area in existence on st july <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord elton i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the three noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i should not like to let this opportunity go without recording my thanks for the way in which the house has treated the changeover on this bill <e> <s> i shall of course forward all the remarks that have been made today straight to my noble friend lord avon who i understand is currently in france <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously do not fit into the generality do i <e> <s> another point which the noble baroness lady birk mentioned and to which i ought to refer is that of limiting compensation to genuine cases or perhaps a more accurate description would be the genuine parts of cases <e> <s> we did try to work out a different way but we came to the conclusion after a great deal of thought that a -month limitation was the best way to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i was most grateful to receive a copy of this report in which i must confess i found little which was new <e> <s> it did however make its points in a lucid and cogent way <e>", "<cs> my lords young people as such are not of course one of the priority need categories set out in the housing and homeless persons act <e> <s> however individual young people may fall into priority need categories as being vulnerable <e> <s> in our code of guidance we have asked authorities to secure accommodation whenever possible for homeless young people at risk of sexual or financial exploitation <e> <s> so far as concerns accommodation it is for the local authorities to see in what way they can best use the accommodation available to them and to assess their own priorities in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of the yts grant is quite different from the social housing needs of other benefits <e> <s> i would however counsel young people to make very certain that they have a place of residence before moving away from home <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning the last part of the noble baronesss question yes of course the government are concerned <e> <s> the new supplementary benefit board and lodging regulations are designed to stop exploitation by landlords and also by young <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a possibility but the noble lord again presupposes that people leave home or where they are living at the time for long periods in order to seek employment <e> <s> this is by no means universally the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the article to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> it is well known that my honourable friend the minister for housing is looking at what provision can be made within the private rented sector to meet this particular case <e> <s> however regarding local authority housing it is as i say a matter of priorities for the local authority concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is perhaps a little wide of the question bearing in mind the debate that we are about to have on the subject of the metropolitan counties and the glc <e> <s> however i totally disagree with the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> as i said earlier my honourable friend the minister for housing is currently looking at this particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there are currently empty council dwellings in london of which have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard and read various wild assertions on this particular point <e> <s> however it must be true to say that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities have specific duties towards the homeless under the housing homeless persons act <e> <s> it is for them to decide in the light of the guidance we have given them how to fulfil these duties and how to use the housing investment resources available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can at least agree with the noble lord lord grimond that this is the greatest human tragedy <e> <s> as i outlined in my original answer to the noble lord parliament has given to local authorities specific duties on homelessness <e> <s> my own view is that it would be inappropriate to allow local authorities to use all their capital receipts when they have vast numbers of empty local authority houses which have been out of use for more than a year <e> <s> countrywide there were properties empty for more than a year <e> <s> as i said yesterday of these were in london <e>", "<cs> my lords for a start i would take issue with the noble lords figures <e> <s> the fact that people are homeless at any one moment does not mean that the problem of homelessness is of that extent <e> <s> by definition once people have been found houses by a local authority they disappear from the figures that have been quoted by the noble lord <e> <s> but equally of course other people come in so it is a constantly changing situation <e> <s> so far as passing the buck to local authorities goes parliament gave a specific duty to local authorities in this respect <e> <s> all that i am doing is reminding the house and them of it <e>", "<cs> my lords it sounds a very easy answer does it not to allow councils to build more and more houses <e> <s> but the figures i have given for empty properties and properties empty for more than one year would only be added to by building these houses <e> <s> in regard to reducing the capacity of local authorities to spend money on housing i would point out that from to date such spending has been reduced by per cent <e> <s> i might remind noble lords opposite that in their last period of government it was reduced by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course it is <e> <s> i hope that i made the point yesterday <e> <s> as to releasing dwellings that might be available in the private sector perhaps i may say that i was interested to learn recently of a scheme in camden where the council is starting to do just this <e> <s> i am not sure that everything about the scheme is absolutely perfect but certainly the council is working hard to alleviate the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with individual people <e> <s> i know that there are some critically homeless people such as those living under the arches who do not fit into what the establishment regards as a proper life <e> <s> as to the idea of a meeting yes i should be perfectly happy to recommend the summoning of such a meeting <e> <s> however with such activities as the governments hostels scheme which has given extra places in the last five years i am not sure whether it would achieve very much <e> <s> but i shall certainly look into the idea <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rhodes asked me exactly this question in different words yesterday <e> <s> i said then that the answer was no <e> <s> i am now able to say that the answer is still no because there is no reason why the boroughs should not provide exactly the same funds as the greater manchester council is now providing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for expanding on a point that i have just made <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i am not sure that i got the drift of the noble lords question <e> <s> however i made the point yesterday that it does not take a long period for people to find out whether there is work available for them in a particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily acknowledge the experience of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton as regards local councils <e> <s> however i am sure he will agree that local government is a matter of priorities <e> <s> it cannot be a matter of good priority if these houses are left empty for so long <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do not have the list in front of me but there are at least nine research projects being carried out on exactly the sort of issue to which the noble lord has just referred <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble and learned friend the lord advocate will with the leave of the house repeat in the form of a statement an answer to a private notice question on the death at glenochil young offenders institution <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for raising this evening this important and topical subject of the future of the water industry <e> <s> we know him as a world renowned expert in his subject and a distinguished chairman of the national water council <e> <s> during my time in your lordships house i have learnt an enormous amount from him both on sub-committee g of your lordships select committee on the european community and more recently since i have been privileged to speak for the government on water matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i freely admit to being an amateur <e> <s> i am even more of an amateur than the noble baroness has just admitted that she is <e>", "<cs> nonetheless my lords the fact that we have a presumption in this country that government discussion papers are by way of a green paper does not automatically mean that all government discussion has to be promoted by a green paper <e> <s> i fully accept the point made by the noble baroness and the noble lord lord sherfield that this is novel but that does not necessarily mean that it is bad <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that amplification <e> <s> the answer is that there need not be an effect <e> <s> as i have been at pains to point out i fear over far too long now the government have not yet made up their minds on this issue <e> <s> they have promoted discussion as to how it might be done if it were done <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord elton i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of housing with all its ramifications has been one of recurring interest in your lordships house for many years <e> <s> i therefore welcome this opportunity to debate these important issues again <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal for putting down this motion today <e> <s> it will not surprise her to learn that i do not draw the same conclusions from her speech as she did <e> <s> she says the problem can be solved quite easily by guess what the same old pale tired solution of throwing money at the problem which resulted in throwing this country into the arms of the imf <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will allow me to make my own speech in my way <e> <s> i shall come to those points which he has made and i fully recognise that there have been improvements in design in building by local authorities such as he has said since the s <e> <s> but i still reckon that all is far from perfect <e> <s> there is quite a lot more that could be done in the public-rented sector to give people what they want <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had little formal reaction from the industry <e> <s> the measures contained in the budget in particular the abolition of development land tax and the chancellors assurances about vat should have been very encouraging to the construction industry <e> <s> the industry is benefiting from the long-term economic growth which the governments policies are securing <e> <s> in private sector completions were at their highest level for eight years and last year output of private industrial and commercial work grew by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable and right honourable friends have constant contact with the building and construction industry and the fact that the personnel involved were changed reflects no discredit on them <e>", "<cs> no before the budget my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be very good reasons for improving the infrastructure but employment is not one of the them <e> <s> in a recent trip to see a sewer renovation scheme i discovered for myself that the contractor had not employed one extra man <e>", "<cs> my lords the caravan sites act for which my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment has general responsibility places a duty on county councils in england and wales and on london borough councils to provide sites for gipsies <e> <s> my department and the welsh office have regular contacts with local authorities and the association of county councils about gipsy site matters generally <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite right and it is absolutely right that he should be right <e>", "<cs> no my lords because councils get a per cent <e> <s> exchequer grant for these sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that there is a statutory definition of the word gipsy which runs as follows <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume it would be appropriate to tell your lordships committee that we shall not return to this stage of the bill until pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has come to the conclusion that the boroughs and districts will not be <e>", "<cs> i have detailed figures which i shall be perfectly happy to make available to noble lords perhaps by putting them in <e>", "<cs> i had no intention of being abusive to the committee <e> <s> i delivered my speech for exactly the reasons which i have just given <e>", "<cs> it is not in the governments hands whether or not we have a vote <e> <s> the procedure is that we shall continue and that i shall seek to resume the house after this amendment has been disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i think it has been agreed through the usual channels that we will not return to this particular bill until ten minutes to nine oclock <e>", "<cs> i recognise the fear expressed by the noble lord lord graham in this matter but i hope i can show that his fear is unfounded <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and a would substantially increase the complexity of the existing planning system <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i think that i ought to say three things in answer to the noble lords speech <e> <s> the local planning authority in control receives the application for example to develop and at the end of the day whatever may happen in the meantime grants the application <e> <s> secondly the secretary of state is well aware of what is going on <e> <s> he has various forms of information <e> <s> as was pointed out earlier this afternoon he has the regional offices in various parts of the country <e> <s> he has the opportunity to read the press reports and if he does not read them personally someone in his department will very soon point them out to him <e> <s> there is also the power of parliament <e> <s> the noble lord since he arrived in this house has constantly questioned the government on the subject of planning <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness that he is absolutely right <e> <s> we have talked about the sussex downs and we have had debates about cornwall and i seem to remember about other things and i have no doubt that we shall again <e> <s> that is another way that parliament can bring matters of concern to the attention of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> as i understand the matter the local inquiry procedure is involved where for example the decision or the proposed decision of the local planning authority goes against its plans either its structure plan or in the case of this bill its unitary development plan <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the way that he has moved this quite large block of amendments <e> <s> i was most interested to learn from the noble lords speech that there are some hectares <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i should have said that there are hectares i took it down wrongly in greater london that have been damaged by former mineral workings <e> <s> that might well be so <e> <s> but these amendments seek to make different provision for mineral planning in greater london and the metropolitan counties from that applying elsewhere in england and wales <e> <s> i really cannot see any good reason for this <e> <s> it has been suggested not by the noble lord but in another place and elsewhere that such different treatment is appropriate because mineral development is particularly significant in these areas <e> <s> but from april to march only mineral planning applications were decided in the whole of the glc area and the metropolitan counties put together <e> <s> that is not a very great many <e> <s> moreover in another place it was authoritatively stated that the greater london council employ only four officers on their mineral planning responsibilities and my information is that only about staff are engaged on the function in all of the metropolitan areas <e> <s> no one in these circumstances can say that mineral extraction is a major activity in these conurbations <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this discussion but i give readily and willingly the undertaking that my noble friend lord molson has just asked of me <e> <s> in doing that i am as we all are immensely grateful to my noble friend lord colville <e> <s> i should point out that we recently debated this matter at some length which is why i have truncated my speech when we were discussing what is now the mineral workings act <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and i all took part <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness should not leap so fast <e> <s> she might leap more slowly and get more effect out of her interventions <e> <s> however i was about to say that to rephrase it noble lords have no monopoly of compassion in industrial wastelands <e> <s> that is why we have the urban development grant <e> <s> ministers in my department who are specifically charged with the responsibility for such subjects are continually wandering around the country looking at it and doing their very best to improve the situation <e> <s> there is one last point and that is that local authorities for reasons we all know are not necessarily builders so for derelict land there has to be a planning application in the first place <e> <s> having said that i am grateful to everybody who has spoken <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> these amendments propose that local planning authorities in greater london and the metropolitan counties should act jointly to keep matters affecting the development of london and the metropolitan areas under consideration and should make joint decisions as to whether to carry out a survey of such matters <e> <s> the amendments are therefore attempting to carry forward joint working for the whole area of london and the conurbations <e>", "<cs> if i may be allowed to answer some of the points that have been raised in this short debate the first thing i should like to say on the amendment as it stands on the order paper this is probably an answer to the noble lord lord shinwell is that if it was within the principle of the bill and made things better we would of course take it away consider it and in other words accept it in principle but from my earlier comments the committee will realise that i do not think this <e>", "<cs> in that case if it has got itself together does it really need the metropolitan county of the west midlands to keep it together <e> <s> this really should be the argument <e>", "<cs> if i may rise to that i freely accept that particular charge <e>", "<cs> certainly my noble friend made a valuable contribution to this debate but he said as i understood him that he did not consider this amendment to be the right approach <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to speak with him at a later stage and indeed with the noble baroness as to what the right approach should be <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall be able to respond to that particular point raised by my noble friend lord broxbourne in a minute but for a moment perhaps i may turn to the amendment proper <e> <s> this amendment concerns the contents of the unitary development plan and seeks to add to the list set out in paragraph of schedule a requirement for an explanatory memorandum in respect of part of the plan <e> <s> there is no doubt that the noble baroness lady stedman has a point here and i am sure that the intention of her amendment is to ensure that the thinking behind the policies in part i of the udp can be understood by all those who might make use or have cause to comment on the plan the general public local planning <e>", "<cs> it seems that the committee are at one on this point and i am very grateful to my noble friend lord colville for as it were giving us guidance on the consideration of this matter <e> <s> of course we will consider very carefully what he has said in his speech and probably although i cannot actually promise this use it as the basis for our consideration of the point raised in the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> i think it would be helpful to the committee if i were to say that we have powers already to synchronise the preparation of plans where necessary by the simultaneous commencement order procedure which is in the bill and concurrent local plan inquiries <e> <s> if necessary the secretary of state may call in neighbouring part is of udps and hold an examination in public <e> <s> i hope that that will also be helpful to the committee <e>", "<cs> i think the committee might agree with me at this point that this is a mixture of a probing amendment asking what on earth is the lpc going to do <e> <s> and the actual words printed on the marshalled list which comprise this amendment <e> <s> to start with the latter as the noble lord lord graham has said this amendment concerns the functions of the proposed london planning commission <e> <s> it proposes that an entirely new and separate duty should be placed upon the lpc to give specific regard to all the matters contained in the greater london development plan and to the proposed alterations to that plan <e> <s> it also specifies a number of particular issues concerning the economics population and transport of the area to which the lpc should have regard <e>", "<cs> they are londoners indeed and i accept that but we were talking in planning terms rather than in personal feelings terms if i may express it in such a way <e> <s> this duty would be additional to the duty specified in paragraph of the schedule which is to assist the secretary of state in preparing guidance for local planning authorities in greater london in relation to their preparation of unitary development plans and to advise him on other matters relating to the planning and development of greater london <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham referred to the comparison between the london boroughs and suffolk and surrey which were the two shire counties that he mentioned <e> <s> he suggested that they would be disadvantaged because of size of area <e> <s> i should tell him that the big stick for which he is looking whether on this or on other amendments is there although i cannot lay to hand the reference in the bill <e> <s> the point is that the udps have to be compatible with each other and if not the secretary of state will call them in to make them so <e>", "<cs> yes absolutely and the sooner the boroughs start to talk not only to each other but to us the sooner we shall be able to make definitive statements on these and on many other matters <e>", "<cs> again as i was saying to my noble friend lord sandford just now i am not in the position to say at this moment nor is the secretary of state himself for what kind of advice they will be asked <e> <s> i can add to the information i have given to the committee that at the moment we expect the membership to be between and with a small staff which will be non-executive <e> <s> nor will it be a planning authority it will be there purely to give advice <e>", "<cs> that occurred to me when i said it but i wondered whether it was appropriate to make the comment then <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my noble friend was in the committee when i said that udps have to be compatible and if they are not my right honourable friend the secretary of state will call them in to ensure that they are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friends but in fact my argument rest on more than that <e> <s> we are not necessarily talking about revocation of structure plans as a whole <e> <s> we could in certain circumstances be talking about revocation of parts of structure plans <e> <s> as part of the transitional arrangements paragraph of the schedule provides that the greater london development plan and the structure plans in force in the metropolitan counties at abolition shall continue in force in each of the boroughs or districts until a unitary development plan for the area becomes operative <e> <s> the structure plan in so far as it relates to the area of the udp will then be revoked automatically <e>", "<cs> yes water under the bridge <e> <s> where the secretary of state uses his similar powers under schedule of the act there is no such <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness lady birk want to come in on this or to speak to her own amendment on its merits <e>", "<cs> some alterations to structure plans have already been submitted to the secretary of state for example those concerning the greater london development plan and as we heard earlier this afternoon that of the west yorkshire county council <e> <s> in the case of the gldp the secretary of state has already announced that under his powers in section of the local government interim provisions act he is deferring his consideration of the proposed alterations and in the other case he <e>", "<cs> yes i most certainly shall and i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> some of the guts will of course be provided by the boroughs and districts themselves which already contribute input into the original wider area plan and the rest of the guts it would seem to me <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have a second bite at this particular cherry which i must confess i find extremely complicated <e> <s> i should make it clear that where possible the secretary of state will consider and determine before st april all structure plan proposals which have been submitted to him and which can be processed in time <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell has commented twice on the drafting of this paragraph and i am advised that the reference to withdrawal is a term taken from the act in relation to structure plans <e> <s> the purpose is to free the boroughs and the secretary of state from an obligation to take those proposals into account as a material consideration when considering planning applications <e> <s> this is only fair and just when it is considered that these proposals have not been subjected to public examination <e> <s> however nothing in this prevents the boroughs and the lpcs from using these alterations when preparing guidance on the udps <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble baroness no most certainly the proposed amendment which i have suggested the government will put down for the report stage is based on the situation as it is in the bill but will just clarify it <e> <s> it will in fact be a technical and drafting amendment but it will certainly not have the effect that the noble baroness has requested <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume i think i should say that it has been agreed that we shall not return to this business until ten past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord lord graham and my noble friend lady gardner that i too am a fan of covent garden <e> <s> my only regret is that the price of tickets at the opera house is often higher than my pocket can stand <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me various questions to which i shall respond but i should like to make it clear from the outset that the absence of ecology and nature conservation from this bill does not mean that the government are overlooking such matters <e> <s> what i have to say now is general to the various amendments on conservation and conservation-related subjects which we are going to discuss on the next few amendments <e>", "<cs> no i do not think the noble lord has at all misunderstood <e> <s> what i was saying is that local democracy is local democracy and therefore it is for the boroughs to decide their priorities in their particular area <e> <s> i went on to say that i have no doubt that they will take the view that has just been expressed in the committee and which i share but it is for them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett has misunderstood <e> <s> of course this bill does not override any of the provisions of the wildlife and countryside act which we discussed at great length in <e> <s> what however it does is give responsibility in this particular instance to the landowner and as the noble lord well knows the landowner has responsibility for all the sssis in the country whether they belong to the nature conservation trust to local authorities to one of my noble friends or even the noble lord lord melchett himself <e> <s> it is the landowner who has the responsibility and it is exactly that that is going to happen under this bill <e>", "<cs> it is quite simple <e> <s> the bill directs that any property vested in the glc at the moment will go to the borough in which it stands <e> <s> that is the first thing <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether there have been any consultations <e> <s> the very shaming truth is no because unfortunately you cannot consult with people who refuse to be consulted with <e> <s> that is the position we are in right across this bill <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that at all <e> <s> what i said was that each of the sites with which the noble lord is concerned will go to the borough in which it exists geographically <e> <s> what i also said was that there had been no consultations because unfortunately consultations are not very forthcomng surrounding this bill <e> <s> i wish they were <e>", "<cs> the glc will not consult nor will a fair proportion of the boroughs in london <e> <s> that is the position <e>", "<cs> no i am not <e> <s> i am just making the point which has been made several times by my <e>", "<cs> i wish i knew the answer to that question <e> <s> i will certainly look into it because i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that discussions are going on with the buckinghamshire county council but the noble lord lord melchett who knows this area very much better than i do has said that it will fall into dual ownership and it is that which i promised my noble friend lord onslow that i would look into <e> <s> i can only add that if there are conditions applying to that land because there are sites of special scientific interest exactly the same obligations will apply to the new owner as to the old <e> <s> but i have a feeling that i said that some minutes ago and it does not really add to my explanation in this discussion <e>", "<cs> the whole local authority setup is all about priorities <e> <s> what this bill does is to bring local government closer to the people by involving boroughs and districts very much more in various items and this subject is one of those items <e> <s> i do not see the problem <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord can do what i failed to do which is to ask the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i must be very brief and there are only two things that i want to say <e> <s> first i want to repeat that the local authorities will be subject to their overriding responsibilities as landowners under the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> secondly as i understand it the glc is an elected body at the moment and the successor bodies in this case will also be elected bodies <e> <s> therefore it is a matter for the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully understand the implications of the court of appeals decision for landlords who have let their homes intending to seek possession using case of schedule to the rent act <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for housing and construction hopes to make an announcement very soon about what action will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords at this remove it is of course difficult to say precisely how parliament intended case to work when it was originally enacted in the rent act <e> <s> however the decision of the court of appeal has overturned the widely accepted view of its effect the widely accepted view i might add which has been held by all governments since <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the decision may well deter owners from letting their homes <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why the government are looking urgently at what action can be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the house often hears the words urgently very shortly and so on from this box <e> <s> however may i say that in this case urgently is a good deal quicker than very shortly <e> <s> however in answer to my noble friends question i am aware of the judgment given yesterday by the law lords in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot remember whether the noble lord lord grimond took part in our discussions on this very wide subject on wednesday of last week <e> <s> however i accept that the inquiry to which i have just referred has been taking a long time to accomplish <e> <s> there is very good reason for this as the subject surrounding the review has wide implications for a large number of people <e> <s> i can only add that only fools rush in where angels fear to tread <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> not having the legal experience of my noble friend i am afraid i do not recall that particular comment but of course i totally agree with what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i almost totally agree with the noble lord lord graham but this particular judgment concerns a case where a landlord relets while he is still abroad <e> <s> with that proviso i accept totally what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously something that we shall be looking into in our urgent consideration of this case <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but i do not want to trail any false herrings <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can answer the major part of the intervention of the noble lord lord shinwell i do not think that is for me <e> <s> but what i can do is attempt to answer the various speeches that have been made on this very important series of amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady fisher for directing our minds to that point <e> <s> in the speech which i have just made i assumed that the expertise of these ecology units would go on and i said that i thought that their expertise was directly relevant to the problems as has been expressed from all corners of the committee <e> <s> as regards derelict land sites in inner city areas they may very well have and indeed already have an input into the consideration of what that land should finally be used for <e> <s> for example there are very often <e>", "<cs> no not in total <e> <s> the point is i think that you cannot have the one without the other <e> <s> basically anybody can do the job if they are once told what to do <e> <s> i suggest that at this moment we should concentrate our minds on the centres of expertise which can provide basic back-up and basic knowledge for the carrying out of the work on the ground which incidentally need not necessarily and already is not necessarily done by employees of any local authority <e> <s> one knows for example of the inestimable value of the work being done by the british trust for conservation volunteers to name but one <e>", "<cs> no exactly the opposite <e> <s> if we do not have the one we will not have the other <e> <s> that is the point i am seeking to address to the committee <e>", "<cs> this is a suitable moment to adjourn the committee and therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i was about to suggest that i might be allowed to reply to the amendment <e> <s> the provision of facilities for recreation in the countryside is primarily <e>", "<cs> green belts are as currently defined in the circular <e> <s> the process of abolition does not change them <e> <s> my noble friend very properly asks are they likely to be broken up because we have smaller conurbations <e> <s> but we do not have smaller conurbations <e> <s> what we do have are district councils rather than metropolitan county councils but the areas will remain <e>", "<cs> rather than be drawn into the green belt question at this stage i shall say that what i have already said that the green belt will not become green chunks in the sense that there will be white or black chunks in between is absolutely correct <e> <s> that was one of the points put to me by my noble friend lord onslow <e>", "<cs> yes and that is yet another reason why the unitary development plans which we have discussed at some length on previous days have been drawn up in the way they have <e> <s> part i has to have the approval of my right honourable friend and equally any one district or borough council has to have consultations with a neighbouring one if its unitary development plan concerns its activities <e> <s> but with the greatest respect i think that it is better to try to go forwards rather than backwards <e>", "<cs> yes we have here two voices with but a single thought <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> i am not sure whether this would be an appropriate moment to turn to the comments made by the noble lord lord davies of leek about the water authorities <e> <s> the government are well seized of the unified river basin management which has been the subject of discussion in so many debates in your lordships chamber over the last two years <e> <s> the government have no present plans to change it and of course that will be relevant when we come to discuss amendments for example on land drainage and the sorts of things which the thames water authority may or may not get up to as a result of the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> i shall return to the noble lords point as regards tenanted land in a moment but so far as resources are concerned i was just about to deal with that very point before he spoke <e> <s> the question of how existing projects funded by the glc and the metropolitan county councils will be handled after abolition is of course of vital importance <e> <s> under our abolition proposals as i sought to reassure your lordships committee on thursday the matters of finances are more or less as the noble baroness lady stedman described them <e> <s> at present the cash for these and other functions of the glc and the metropolitan councils comes from the ratepayers <e> <s> it is taken from them by precepts which are levied via the boroughs and the districts <e> <s> it goes without saying that those precepts will go now not from the glc and the metropolitan counties and can be used certainly in part where they are not needed for other successor bodies which we will come on to a little later by the successor local authorities for their own purposes <e> <s> the functions will now be transferred to the boroughs and districts which can have recourse to exactly the same ratepayers direct <e> <s> the greas and consequently their grants will be adjusted to take account of the transfer of those responsibilities <e>", "<cs> may i just finish the point <e> <s> i see no financial reason therefore why the boroughs and districts should not co-operate in providing facilities which service a wider than local area <e> <s> now i give way <e>", "<cs> if for example land which is owned by the glc is situated in buckinghamshire and it therefore goes to buckinghamshire under the bills proposals what i am saying is that the greas will be altered to take account of those responsibilities <e> <s> certainly on the point about precepting the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> yes that would not involve a shire county <e>", "<cs> if i may correct the noble baroness in that impression what i said was that one-third of the members of the peak park national planning board are ministerial appointments and one of their roles is to give an overview as to what is happening nationally whereas the job of district council members obviously is to represent their own districts <e> <s> so although the noble baroness did not quite understand i hope i have now made myself clear <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be an appropriate moment to take a short break <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed fortunate that this question about the steps her majestys government are taking to protect law centres from closure is being raised tonight by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> it is an issue on which he has a certain proprietorial interest as he has explained and one on which i face him with some trepidation <e> <s> it was during his time on the woolsack that the law centres movement spread its wings and it was the noble and learned lord himself who so i understand first stepped in on behalf of the government of the day between and to save seven law centres from closure when the local authorities who had previously supported these centres withdrew that support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord gifford when he reads the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend gets too far with this amendment may i point out that this is an alternative to the amendments which were accepted earlier this afternoon and therefore it would not sit happily with them on the subject of trading standards <e> <s> therefore with the greatest respect i would advise him not to move it <e>", "<cs> this might be an appropriate moment to resume the house to take the two statements <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be an appropriate moment to resume the house <e> <s> i should say that it has been agreed through the usual channels that we shall not return to this bill until half-past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble lord lord mishcon was addressing his mind to a whole series of amendments not necessarily in his name <e> <s> perhaps he would like to explain the position <e>", "<cs> i believe that amendment no <e> <s> belongs to schedule <e> <s> there is a misprint <e>", "<cs> i think this would be an appropriate moment to take the statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume i should say that it has been agreed that we shall not return to this business until at least pm <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter is under urgent review <e> <s> but i should point out to the noble lord that the in lieu provisions are not the only way of funding the heritage on these occasions <e> <s> there are of course the funds of the office of arts and libraries the countryside commission the national heritage memorial fund and the nature conservancy council and of course special capital transfer tax arrangements are all designed with this object in view <e>", "<cs> my lords there are moments when i wish that i could get embroiled in arguments such as those which your lordships have just heard but i am responding to a bill which has been debated in another place and which is being introduced by the noble lord lord melchett and i am delighted to do that <e> <s> i am delighted also to be able to agree to parts of the speeches made by every noble lord <e> <s> that i might say is a somewhat unusual position for me to be in in the light of my experiences in the chamber over the past month <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case my understanding is different from that of the noble lord and my response would be not yet and i hope never <e> <s> but there are encouraging signs i am sorry my lords <e> <s> the noble lord has thrown me slightly <e> <s> my noble friend lord craigton has drawn attention to the proposal from the all-party conservation committee of both houses for a parliamentary select committee on marine and coastal conservation and development <e> <s> consideration of this proposal has i fear been long delayed <e> <s> the meeting between secretaries of state to which he referred which would have considered the proposal some months ago had alas to be postponed <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that the matter has not by any means been overlooked <e> <s> i have every reason to hope that the long deferred meeting and consideration will take place shortly <e> <s> i would however stress that the voluntary approach to enlist the support and co-operation of those living and working in the areas concerned is by no means exhausted <e> <s> it would be a pity and counter-productive if the threat of compulsion at this stage led to confirmation of fears and a hardening of attitudes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that this is a matter we shall return to at some length at later stages of the bill <e> <s> for the moment i would say that my noble friend lord onslow is only partly right for the reasons i have just explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry if i have given offence to the noble lord lord hunt or anyone in the conservation movement by the use of that particular phrase <e> <s> what i intended to say was that the government have a policy enshrined in the act of a mixture of carrots and sticks <e> <s> i do not want the sticks to outweigh the carrots <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps this is an appropriate moment to take the statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee may i say that i am in more than a little difficulty <e> <s> as i understand it the usual channels have not yet come to a decision on whether we should break at this point <e> <s> however judging by the feeling of the mental pressure around me i understand that it is the wish of the committee that we should do this <e> <s> i would therefore suggest that we do not return to this business until half past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the government warmly welcome this bill which has been so fully and may i say briefly described by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> this matter first came to the attention of the house by means of a starred question from my noble friend lady gardner of parkes which i was privileged to answer <e> <s> i promised then on behalf of the government urgent action to correct a situation which i said at the time at col of the <e>", "<cs> since it has been some committee days since this subject was referred to i should say that of course i totally agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> before this discussion proceeds any further may i ask the noble lord lord beaumont whether he is speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from this dispatch box i should like to congratulate my noble friend lady carnegy for bringing this bill before your <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place on water contamination in the norman shaw south building <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol and to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for their reception of what i can only describe as a very serious statement indeed <e> <s> as the statement makes clear my honourable friend not my right honourable friend as i perhaps said when introducing the statement it was made in another place by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state rather than by my right honourable friend the secretary of state is having all these questions investigated as a matter of great urgency <e> <s> he will have prepared a report of that investigation <e> <s> the report will be placed in the library of both houses and he and i undertake to draw your lordships attention through the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i very naturally appreciate the concern of the house that such an unfortunate incident should not happen within the palace of westminster <e> <s> however perhaps i may be permitted to remind the house that the statement concerns the norman shaw south building which is not technically at any rate a part of the palace of westminster <e> <s> so far as that building is concerned i can confirm that the drinking water comes from a rising main <e> <s> i would expect the position in this palace to be the same but if i am wrong i will make sure that that information goes into the report to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord the leader of the opposition there is a presumption in this country that all water is safe unless one is told that it is not safe <e> <s> in other words it is not unsafe to drink any water in the palace of westminster provided it comes out of a tap <e> <s> however the age of the piping is such that it is always recommended as indeed it is in ones private home to drink water from a rising main but this is by no means totally necessary <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not what i am saying <e> <s> there are two forms of water supply within this house <e> <s> one form comes out of the taps in the washbasins which comes from a water tank situated on the roof of the building and the other form comes in the normal way from the rising main <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i said earlier we are not talking about this building but about the norman shaw south building <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the multiple supplementary questions of the noble viscount and the noble baroness i thank the noble viscount for explaining the position <e> <s> i regret that as regards the norman shaw south building i have not been able to visit the tank this morning and therefore i do not know whether or not it is covered <e>", "<cs> my lords as was explained after question time that is not a matter for me <e> <s> i was asked to repeat the statement and therefore i have done so <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot say why <e>", "<cs> my lords the consultants who monitored economic activity in the first enterprise zones reported that over jobs had been established in the zones by st may over half of these were in new firms <e> <s> between june and december a further jobs had been located in the zones <e> <s> we have recently completed the collation of more up-to-date information <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am well aware of what the consultants had to say on this matter but of course they were taking a very narrow view of the first two years of what is a -year scheme <e> <s> value judgments on these matters will only be satisfactorily arrived at at the end of the years <e> <s> as far as the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned we have no evidence that traders within zones have an unfair advantage over those outside although we are aware of concern on the part of established retailers in shopping centres close to some zones <e> <s> it is likely that the economy of the area as a whole will benefit by the rapid development of the enterprise zone <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know if the noble lord is an avid reader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i did not mean to deflect the noble lords pertinent thoughts <e> <s> the answer is that of course there is collusion within areas between the various job centres for example the one in taunton and the one in exeter which i know well <e> <s> whether this goes wider in the country for example between northampton and taunton is something that i shall have to look into <e> <s> i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think it might well be helpful to the house but as i sought to say in an earlier answer i think that it would be a little previous to make that sort of report now <e> <s> i think we should wait at least until half the period of the experiment is over <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not follow the argument <e> <s> what i have sought to explain to the house is that each enterprise zone is a -year programme and the advantages to the firms in the enterprise zones last for years <e> <s> i have said that it is my view that it is too early to make the sort of assessment which the house very naturally wants us to make in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords running my eye quickly down the list that i have in my brief i see that there are two enterprise zones in the north-east namely in middlesbrough and in scunthorpe <e> <s> the government have at the moment no plans to extend the number of enterprise zones <e> <s> these are of course looked at on application from the local authority concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords this could well be true and i shall of course draw the attention of my right honourable and honourable friends to the points that the house has made today <e> <s> but as far as the per job figure goes i find it very difficult to actually identify how this is made up <e> <s> the only cost that could be stated precisely in all this is the exemption from rates <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords second supplementary is concerned there will of course always be firms who want to move from existing locations for a variety of reasons they need larger premises or a better location for distribution and so on <e> <s> since enterprise zones are in the main located in areas where there has been serious economic decline there is every advantage in having vigorous established firms moving into such areas <e> <s> there is also an advantage in retaining firms within a region when otherwise they might move right outside it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out the deficiencies in my geography <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord maude for pursuing a matter which as he said arose in another place <e> <s> civic pride which is what we are talking about today is a concept that has been sadly missing from your lordships consideration of local government legislation in recent weeks <e> <s> the question that your lordships have to answer today is whether in this case it is misplaced civic pride <e> <s> following the speeches of the three noble lords supporting the bill i should therefore point out that there is another point of view on this matter <e> <s> the bill is an extension of arrangements made under a government amendment to what was then the local government bill passed in your lordships house <e> <s> that amendment allowed former boroughs which were merged into larger districts in to retain the former boroughs royal charters <e> <s> these are held in trust by the councillors of the larger unit who are elected for the area of the former borough <e> <s> the charter trustees as they are called may elect as leader a town mayor thus preserving the continuity of the mayoralty of these ancient towns <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk reminded us that the worry of the committee on nd may was that all the good work on structure plans should not be consigned to the dustbin <e> <s> the approved structure plan will remain in force until a unitary development plan becomes operative and it is to that that the local planning authorities should continue to look in making such decisions rather than proposals which are without statutory status <e> <s> this amendment therefore deleting the offending words proposes that for the avoidance of doubt the phrase should be deleted <e> <s> i should like again to assure the house that those advising the secretary of state on his strategic guidance and the local planning authorities in drawing up their unitary development plans will be expected to take on board whatever is of value in those proposals <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will serve to make it quite clear that there is no barrier in this legislation to prevent them from so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house with the deletion which i am proposing in this amendment paragraph of schedule reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is an appropriate moment to break for the next business <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report be adjourned <e> <s> we shall not return to this business before a quarter past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to the invitation of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> as i understand the position there has been an agreement through the usual channels to finish at the end of amendment no <e> <s> that is clause <e> <s> i have received no comment through the usual channels that the position is to be changed and therefore the matter is entirely up to the noble and learned lord himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords consideration of the in lieu arrangements is under way as a matter of urgency and my noble friend the minister for the arts will of course inform the house of the outcome at the earliest possible date <e>", "<cs> my lords on th may in answer to a supplementary question asked by the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true to say that with the rapid increase in the value of works of art and property in recent years not all ail offers halve been accepted <e> <s> as far as concerns the detailed point which the noble lord made about the french provisions i undertake that my noble friend will of course consider them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the best will in the world i do not think that i can give the noble earl lord perth that assurance but i can confirm that money is still available this year for acceptance in lieu provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can agree with the noble lord that in matters of timing it is predictable <e> <s> there is a very great divergence in the amounts of money that are needed at any particular time <e>", "<cs> no my lords i disagree that this is a notional amount <e> <s> obviously if property is accepted for tax purposes as opposed to revenue this is revenue forgone <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given the noble lord an answer on the french provisions <e>", "<cs> we have had a fascinating discussion on this amendment which has reached far and wide <e> <s> i for one have learnt an awful lot about golden eagles and other birds <e> <s> i return now to the substance of the amendment which would have the effect of removing the full protection currently enjoyed by the or so species of our most threatened wild birds listed in schedule to the act protection which most of them have enjoyed for the past years under the protection of birds act which section of the wildlife and countryside act re-enacted without change <e>", "<cs> i am quite used to being bullied by the noble lord lord melchett but perhaps he will allow me to make my speech one step at a time <e> <s> applications for licences are made to the department of the environment in england to the scottish home and health department in scotland and to the welsh office in wales as appropriate <e> <s> consideration is given to the circumstances of the application balancing the farming conditions against the requirement to conserve the species of birds concerned <e> <s> the views of the nature conservancy council are taken carefully into account <e> <s> it is fair to say that to date no licence has been granted to kill an eagle since the act was passed <e>", "<cs> in reply <e>", "<cs> would it not be absolutely marvellous to be able to wave a magic parliamentary wand and to have a marine nature reserve on the stocks tomorow <e> <s> but it just is not practical <e> <s> it is not practical in part for the reasons enunciated by the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> in conditions such as this you have to consult a very wide range of people <e> <s> you have to consult people namely the fishermen who are not very used to having dealings with the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> this means that it takes even longer to have a marine nature reserve than it does to have a site of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> earlier i referred to the extra million which the government have voted this year to the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i described it as a per cent <e> <s> increase in their grant <e> <s> this is no mean amount of money <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness on the front bench opposite heard me refer to it in the last amendment or the one before but to be asked when we were going to produce more money from national funds to support the ncc even further caused me a little wry amusement i may say <e> <s> money does not grow on trees <e> <s> it has to be justified <e> <s> we had very good reason to justify it as we all know very well in that the nature conservancy council was understaffed <e> <s> the point surely is how this money will be used with special reference to marine nature reserves <e> <s> i cannot say because this is a matter for the ncc themselves <e> <s> they do not of course hypothesise about individual sums of money within their total grant <e> <s> what i can say is that with the extra staff resources they are about to have available the ncc expect substantially to complete the programmes of sssis notified by the end of <e> <s> i have already said that <e> <s> they also intend to increase their staff involvement with marine nature reserves fivefold over the next five years <e> <s> therefore not only are the government taking this matter extremely seriously but the ncc admit themselves that they are taking it extremely seriously <e>", "<cs> that i most certainly did not say <e> <s> i am accused of saying that ministers cannot do anything <e> <s> it is simply not in my nature to say something of that kind <e>", "<cs> the normal procedure is that when an act reaches the statute book it is then necessary to devise procedures which is what was done <e> <s> then as i understand it about months later the sharp end to use a rather inelegant expression started <e> <s> then as we all know some negotiations came to a rather sticky impasse <e> <s> the news i have been able to give to the committee this afternoon is that this impasse is now being resolved and i have asked the committee to give the government another or months <e> <s> i think the position is quite clear on this <e>", "<cs> it is a fact of political life that it is very late in the year to start putting down a private members bill <e> <s> i understand that there are procedures in another place for rushing things through there but i cannot hold out any strong hope that it will arrive here <e> <s> but one commitment i can give your lordships is that the government in this house will not seek to hold up that bill in any way whatsoever should it arrive here <e>", "<cs> i did not say that the government would accept it in this house <e> <s> what i did say was that the government would not stand in its way <e> <s> those are two rather separate things <e>", "<cs> the key question in my noble friends most recent speech was were the government aware of this hiatus in time before the bill left the commons <e> <s> the answer to my noble friend is a flat no <e> <s> they were aware but they were not aware in time <e> <s> the government were not in a position without consulting the ncc to slap down an amendment any way and so the answer is that we were not aware in time <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be equally as brief as my noble friend has been in moving the amendment <e> <s> i should point out that as i understand it the real worry of the local authority associations concerned is that the clause provides for the commission to consult other interested parties in the drawing up of the guidelines and the national park authorities will naturally have an important contribution to make towards their preparation <e> <s> i am sure that we can rely upon the commission not to issue guidelines which are generally unacceptable to the authorities or subsequently to revise them in any way that is generally objectionable to them <e> <s> moreover i am able to give this assurance to the committee namely that the government will consult with the commission on the proposed guidelines to ensure that this is not overlooked <e>", "<cs> irrespective of what the forestry commission do and do not do what we are discussing at this moment is an amendment and whether the words in the amendment would make any difference to the way the forestry commission are behaving <e> <s> i must tell the committee that the answer to that particular conundrum is that it would not <e> <s> this amendment would not alter the arrangements which already exist between the forestry commission and the nature conservancy council for handling applications for grant-aid and felling permission in sssis <e> <s> under the terms of the statutory directions issued by the three forestry ministers the forestry commission is required to consult with other departments and authorities as appropriate on grants of felling applications <e> <s> in the case of the ncc there is a long-standing agreement that the forestry commission will consult on all such cases arising within sssis and national nature reserves <e>", "<cs> that was an interesting intervention in my speech <e> <s> all i can say is that the position of creag meggiadh has been decided by my right honourable friend the secretary of state and matters have been proceeding from that decision <e> <s> what i was saying before i became embroiled in particular points on particular forests brought up by the noble lord lord melchett and other noble lords was that this amendment does not actually add anything to the existing lore and therefore in technical terms is totally otiose <e> <s> that is my view so far as the amendment is concerned <e> <s> if i may repeat what i was saying about the abernethy forest the agreement was given in the winter of under a plan of operations which lasted for five years <e> <s> therefore the fact that the most recent felling was done in is within that agreed plan of operations <e>", "<cs> what i was going on to say but my noble friend the earl of onslow interrupted and said exactly the same point in the second of the two speeches that i was making was that the permission would not be given now without full and proper consultation <e> <s> in other words the situation <e>", "<cs> i am informed that amendment no <e> <s> which of course is an amendment to clause of the bill which is an entirely different situation adds nothing to the existing statute and therefore should be resisted from this box on those grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is an appropriate moment to break and to move on to the next business <e> <s> i should say that we will not recoavene on this bill until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could intervene <e> <s> i understood that by arrangement through the usual channels amendment no <e> <s> a had been grouped with the amendment to which the noble lord lord sherfield has just spoken <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord graham that it will receive exactly the same reception as the last one did from my noble friend lord brabazon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i bring my noble friend to order <e> <s> we have not had the question put on amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to have reached an appropriate moment in this report stage <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord kilmarnock goes too far along this road i have observed that although technically speaking it is his amendment he did not move it but the noble lord lord john-mackie did <e> <s> the noble lord therefore has already spoken once and we are at report stage which puts the house in some difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now probably an appropriate moment to move on to next business <e> <s> i should say that the house will not come back to this particular bill before <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess i derived a certain amount of innocent amusement from the first part of the speech of the noble lord lord birkett which sought to knock down arguments

the noble lords view and i am very grateful that he gave it <e> <s> but the point i was making was that the boroughs will be free to carry on such events as thamesday the south bank weekend the greater london horse show the easter parade in battersea park or anything else that has been mentioned this evening <e> <s> the important point is that the decisions on whether they wish to continue these events or organise new ones must be left to them <e> <s> we expect them to continue to take their sports and recreational facilities seriously as indeed everyone will admit they have done in the past <e> <s> over and over again the opposition have based their case on what i can only call not trusting the local authorities <e> <s> this clause represents another unwarranted and quite unnecessary check on the freedom of responsible and capable successor bodies <e> <s> i therefore urge the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is an appropriate moment to move to other business <e> <s> before moving the usual motion i should say that the house will not return to this business before twenty to nine <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate my noble friend on her perspicacity in observing that the bill does not as drafted properly bring itself into line with the local government act for england and wales and the local government scotland act and that these two amendments do exactly that <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness lady nicol should feel disconcerted <e> <s> this is of course a private members bill and the government have given approval to it as she well knows both in this house and in another place <e> <s> the objective of the bill surely should be that it is drafted in a right and proper form for the statute book so that in the unlikely event that litigation is ever sought there is a properly formed act of parliament on the statute book on which such litigation can be based <e> <s> i do not see that it matters whether it is in this house or in another place that the ultimate drafting perfection takes place <e>", "<cs> if any proof were needed of my remarks to the noble baroness lady nicol opposite it has just come from my noble friend in that it is totally a private members bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i detect that it is the wish of the house that we should move on to other business <e> <s> it has been agreed that we shall not return to this business until twenty five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move therefore that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords we had hoped by this stage to have progressed slightly further down the marshalled list <e> <s> unfortunately that has proved to be totally impractical <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord lord graham was in the chamber when i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> applying exactly the same point to the residuary bodies <e> <s> this amendment does for the ilea what that amendment did for the residuary bodies <e> <s> so it would permit enforcing authorities to release information acquired under the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act <e> <s> section restricts the circumstances under which information can be released <e> <s> in particular information would only be released for the purposes of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord airedale has raised an important point which as he said has general application and i shall cover the generality a little later in my remarks <e> <s> at this point i should say that i am afraid that this is such an important general point that it will take rather longer to answer than the time it took the noble lord to move this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords tempting as it would be to follow the advice of the noble lord lord graham to make a gesture the noble lord lord irving made it perfectly clear in seeking to withdraw this amendment that he thought that just for once if i may paraphrase what he said there may be some conciliation possible between this and the next stage to which my noble friend quite properly replied no <e> <s> if the noble lord is seeking to withdraw the amendment under a misapprehension i do not think it is right in the interests of the house that he should be allowed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords for the second time in hours i have to say quite genuinely that six months ago i never thought that this day would ever come <e> <s> that it has is due to the combined efforts of many people too many for me to mention by name <e> <s> through the difficult medium of a private members bill we will have on the statute book an act of parliament that strengthens the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> i would say to the noble baroness lady nicol that had it been a government bill it is my own personal view that it would inevitably have ended up as a very different animal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the government naturally recognise the vital importance of conserving the countryside and we will give active consideration to this in our privatisation plans <e>", "<cs> my lords in privatisation each industry or firm is considered on its merits <e> <s> for example we recently went through the long exercise in this house of passing a bill for the privatisation of british telecom <e> <s> in that bill safeguards were made having regard to the particular circumstances of that industry <e> <s> i do not believe that the scattergun approach which the noble baroness is suggesting would be appropriate to what are very differing circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that governments have been spectacularly good in recent years at running industries <e>", "<cs> my lords there are in force already particular duties on water authorities which we debated at some length during the course of the water bill through this house in <e> <s> in view of what i have already said about particular circumstances pertaining in different industries and firms it would be premature to comment further at this stage on the detailed issues arising from what is a possible but as yet by no means probable privatisation of the water authorities <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and that is why i answered the original question which the noble baroness put down on the order paper in the way that i did <e> <s> i said <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord bessborough has explained this bill will empower local planning authorities to enforce replanting of woodland trees which are removed or destroyed in contravention of a tree preservation order and he has stressed that it will apply only in that particular circumstance <e> <s> this is clearly a bill that is uncontroversial <e> <s> as my noble friend has said it has attracted support from a wide range of interests from one of the leading amenity bodies the council for the preservation of rural england from the farming and landowning interests represented by the nfu and the cla from the local authority associations from commercial forestry interests represented by the timber growers and as we have heard from the men of the trees and from the tree council which if i may for once put in a plug for the department was formed just over a decade ago <e>", "<cs> my lords any sort of plug <e> <s> it was formed just over a decade ago to promote the planting and protection of amenity trees and my department gives financial support to it <e> <s> here endeth the plug <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of the noble lord lord melchett seeks to add the words areas for urban nature conservation to the matters on which my right honourable friend will be required to lay a report before parliament under clause of the bill <e> <s> your lordships will remember that that was added to the bill in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that an urban conservation area would not be included in the word countryside but i would have expected and i am so advised that it would be included in the phrase currently in clause wider county areas <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for a moment perhaps i may point out that the noble lord is speaking to his own amendment on the third reading of an important bill and therefore any criticisms and replies that he wishes to make would within standing orders be pertinently made when he winds up on the amendment rather than by constant intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further proceedings after third reading on the local government bill be now adjourned i would say that we will not return for further proceedings on this bill until pm <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the mersey is the most polluted river system and estuary in the united kingdom it is a disgrace <e> <s> that is

<e> <s> i agree with the background to the supplementary question provided by the noble lord lord graham but i always made it clear on behalf of the government that recreational gardening is a matter for education and not for legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have just been through in this house a local government measure taking up several weeks of your lordships time i would regard that as both radical and reforming <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that on th february the government of this country were a labour government <e> <s> it was that government to whom i was referring <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> if this amendment is to be discussed even in retrospect so to speak i think that the question should first be put <e>", "<cs> my lords this information is not available <e> <s> it is for each local authority to decide whether or not periodic reports are submitted to committees on allotment matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for answering educational questions <e> <s> under the local government planning and land act sections and of the smallholdings and allotments act were repealed <e> <s> these placed on local authorities a duty to keep separate allotment accounts and to make an annual report which is why this information is not available centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords we are putting a lot of thought and not a little pressure into the provision of allotments but the point at issue as i understand it from the noble lord lord wallace is that this pressure should be statutory pressure <e> <s> i have made it perfectly clear over the last two years that statutory pressure is not to be considered on the grounds that we have no proof out in the country that local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were apparent to central government as it periodically is on all sorts of other matters that local demands are not being met then central government will of course act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord feels that allotments are not getting common sense treatment from the department of the environment <e> <s> however as i said earlier under the local government planning and land act the duty on local authorities to make an annual report has been abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords the census showed that about million owner-occupier households in england had more than four rooms and more than two rooms per person but whether these were under-occupied is for the individual households to judge <e> <s> no estimates are available of the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty in drafting legislation to amend the rent acts is made all the greater by the official oppositions attitude an unconstructive attitude if i may say so to any kind of approval of such a change <e> <s> i would agree with my noble friend that it is not widely known that lodgers are normally outside the scope of the rent acts and associated legislation <e> <s> i also accept that this is not explicit in the departmental booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the point made by the noble lord lord avebury but of course universities are principally interested in student accommodation and i certainly agree that in that regard they have a very good record <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend that it is certainly something which could be done <e> <s> the question is really on the timing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said already in my original answer that the existing fiscal arrangements should not discourage householders from taking lodgers <e> <s> i would also make the point that if they take lodgers the cost of any repairs to their houses that are consequent upon their taking of lodgers is of course eligible for tax relief <e> <s> when the noble lord talks about newly-built houses he is totally excluding the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i totally agree with my noble friend <e> <s> mobility of labour is paramount and the more people can be persuaded through for example the booklet which i mentioned earlier the more will be added to the mobility of labour which is in the interests of all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords the allotment acts require local authorities to charge reasonable rents for their allotments subject to abatements in cases of individual hardship <e> <s> my department has long urged local authorities to regard the provision of allotments on an equal basis with the provision of other recreational activities <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be the first time for something like two-and-a-half years that the noble lord has been pleased by one of my answers on this subject <e> <s> i am grateful to him for pointing that out to the house <e> <s> rents to be charged for allotments let by local authorities are governed by section of the allotments act which requires them to let their allotments at such rents as tenants may be reasonably expected to pay <e> <s> as i said in my original answer there are of course abatements in cases of individual hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right i did not answer the other part of his supplementary question <e> <s> the secretary of state has no <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said in answer to the noble lord that disputes should be settled between the council in question and the allotment association or the individual plot holder <e> <s> i have also pointed out that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has no power to intervene in such disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it perfectly clear that the government will not take action without proof <e> <s> the noble baroness is perfectly correct in that respect <e> <s> if the situation is as described by the noble lord lord wallace over several years now one would have thought that there would have been an enormous number of letters to the department of the environment <e> <s> these have not been forthcoming which is why i say there is no proof <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord melchett and his honourable friend dr clark for bringing this little bill before us <e> <s> its subject was as the noble baroness lady nicol said covered in your lordships house at the committee stage of what is now the wildlife and countryside amendment act by means of an amendment put down by my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i too am sorry that he is not in his place this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both the noble lord lord graham and my noble friend lord kinnoull for expressing approval of these regulations <e> <s> because they are specifically about paying for a service i regret that i shall be unable to answer some of the questions that have been raised by them this evening but i undertake to write to them on the wider points that they have raised <e>", "<cs> my lords we obviously differ <e> <s> if the government were seeking to get per cent <e> <s> of the costs from the applicant then it would be clearly wrong <e> <s> but since we are seeking to have a proportion from both the applicant and general public expenditure we have to decide what that proportion should be <e> <s> my right honourable friend has come to the conclusion that what we should aim at is the to per cent <e> <s> range and we have not yet reached that <e> <s> as i said in my opening speech we are at per cent <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that the department has done no research into that nor to the best of my knowledge has it asked local authorities for their opinion on the situation <e> <s> but one reason for the speeding-up of the time taken to determine planning cases is that more and more people since they have to pay a fee are first going along to the planning officer and getting an off-the-cuff opinion as to whether something is likely to succeed in a particular form or whether it is desirable to change it at the outset <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of what the english housing condition survey revealed and this is all very much part of the infrastructure debate which is going on within the confines of neddy at the moment <e> <s> as regards comparability between the and surveys i totally agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i am aware of the green paper and the standards of fitness paragraph contained in it <e> <s> but since the minimum housing standard dates back to and the last minimum standard in england and wales was set in it is small wonder that consideration of it should be required from time to time <e> <s> as the noble baroness well knows a green paper is a consultative document <e> <s> the document has gone out to over interested organisations and there are no plans at the moment in fact it would be impossible to change the fitness standard before the english housing condition survey got underway <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a point of view which is gaining very wide currency <e> <s> i have already referred to the infrastructure debate which is going on within the confines of neddy <e> <s> however if such action has to be taken it has to be based on modern up-to-date scientific sureveys <e>", "<cs> my lords as i pointed out when the noble baroness asked her first supplementary question we are consulting on redefinition of the minimum housing standard but we do not intend that this should be lower or would change the figures substantially <e> <s> we do not know of course what will be in the new definition until we have consulted upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords spending on housing is one of the very important matters which are considered every year in the public expenditure review and it would be absolutely impossible for me to pre-empt what will be in the next or any future one <e>", "<cs> i think this is a convenient moment for us to take the first statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking on behalf of the government i believe that i can give the noble baroness the categorical assurance that she is seeking namely that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will not confirm any regulations without consulting the nature conservancy council <e> <s> in regard to periodical reviews which were the subject of her second question i am afraid i do not have the answer readily to hand but i shall if i may take the opportunity to write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have no plans to establish a national house building corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords where i do agree with the noble lord is that there is ample expertise available in the private sector in addition to the advisory services provided by the building research establishment of the department of the environment <e> <s> however there has been no evidence of any demand or need for the kind of national body for which the noble lord asks in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not discussing a national house building programme <e> <s> as i understand it we are discussing a national organisation of <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am very happy to do that <e> <s> it has done an excellent job and i have no doubt will continue to do exactly what it was set up to do <e>", "<cs> my lords that would certainly be one route to introduce finance into housing <e> <s> again i agree that the housing corporation has done an excellent job since it was set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of what my honourable friend the minster for housing has said and we shall look at the suggestion of the noble lord to see whether it fits in with the programme which he has outlined <e> <s> but of course we must recognise that more and more people want to own their own houses and that therefore it is not necessarily the case that the local authorities should continue to build them <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments proposals for safeguarding the condition of private sector housing stock in england and wales were published in may this year as a green paper cmnd <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot comment except to say that obviously newspapers thrive on speculation <e> <s> however that does not necessarily mean that we have to be sucked in by it <e> <s> as i said i expect publication of the report shortly <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government have been giving considerable thought to the use of capital receipts in the past months or so especially since those receipts have been increased so dramatically by the successful policy of selling council houses <e> <s> unfortunately if vast amounts of money are spent it has a deleterious effect on inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of not taking this matter seriously <e> <s> i said that we will have to wait for the true picture to be revealed when the results of the inquiry are published <e> <s> certainly one takes all such comments with great seriousness <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about houses which may or may not be fit for human habitation accommodation which may not be in the kind of state in which we should like people

house on previous occasions we have been conducting our own survey <e> <s> todays questions were directed at when the results of that inquiry will be analysed and published <e> <s> i have answered that question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently spending million per year <e> <s> that is action <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lord young of graffham will with the leave of the house repeat the autumn statement that is to be made in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> my noble friend then again with the leave of the house will make a statement on enterprise and employment measures <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord young of graffham i beg to move that this debate be adjourned until tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords the success of the havering scheme was the starting point for the secure tenancies right to repair scheme regulations which will come into operation on st january next <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend does not maintain statistics of local authorities as regards right to repair <e> <s> my right honourable friends concern is that whether or not they agree with the legislation they should implement it <e> <s> i hope that that is the view of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason why any tenant however well off should not take advantage of the right to repair scheme to which i referred in my original answer <e> <s> as regards the second question raised by the noble baroness i point out that this scheme runs parallel with any other scheme which local authorities may be running <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the level of arts council grant for currently being made by my honourable friend the minister for the arts in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble baroness lady birk and to the noble viscount lord chandos for their reception of this statement at any rate in part <e> <s> they were both generous enough to say that the fact that it was being made early or promptly would be a great help to both <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is exactly what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it is more than the average level of inflation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall most certainly pass on my noble friends suggestion <e> <s> i must confess that i share his intense dislike of subsidies and that was exactly why i commended the noble viscount lord chandos for his suggestion of a pound for pound scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the last point first the charging of entry fees by museums and galleries is entirely a matter for them <e> <s> i stand corrected by the noble lord <e> <s> i

authorities and the increase in their gre <e> <s> if local authorities are unable to find one-seventh of per cent <e> <s> of their total budget for this purpose i really despair of local authorities

concerning sport i regard it as a general safety question <e> <s> as a result i do not think that the size of the pool comes into the matter <e> <s> the important point is that children should be

not accept that cuts are being made in the education service in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the education act is that when swimming is taught in school hours it automatically becomes part of the curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of possible causes including air pollution for the damage which has been observed to forests in central europe <e> <s> there is a wide consensus among involved scientists that lakes in certain sensitive areas of europe have been damaged by acid deposition <e> <s> both forests and lakes are subject to many stresses and an extensive european research programme including some million worth of work supported by my department is aimed at clarifying the factors responsible for the observed damage <e>", "<cs> yes my lords

cannot serve a notice on their own council both public and private tenants have common law rights <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature conservancy council is making good progress <e> <s> the government hope to be able to reach a decision on the first statutory marine nature reserve in the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords there has certainly been an argument over by-laws but i do not think that this is the real reason <e> <s> the real reason is suspicion generally among the various interests involved <e> <s> the noble baroness will remember that during the renotification process of sssis on land which i am happy to say is still continuing and going on apace there were also initial suspicions and these have taken a very long time to overcome <e> <s> so it is hardly surprising that the marine suspicions if i may call them that have taken just as long if not longer <e>", "<cs> my lords last may we said that we should have to reconsider the law if we had not achieved a reserve within to months <e> <s> that point has not yet been reached <e> <s> if it is reached then of course we shall do exactly that <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the things that the government have been very successful in doing is increasing the grant-in-aid to the nature conservancy council by per cent <e> <s> in and in the year starting this april by a further per cent <e> <s> so at the very least funding will not be an inhibitor <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very surprised if the model by-laws are not finalised next week <e>", "<cs> my lords inevitably the processes are something that evolve over time and it will obviously take very much longer to realise the first one identified by the nature conservancy council as being of scientific interest <e> <s> the process is such that second and third ones will take a very much shorter time <e>", "<cs> my lords since the right to buy was introduced in the government have received applications for the exemption of elderly persons dwellings <e> <s> of these have been granted have been refused and are still under consideration <e> <s> following consultations with the local authority associations the institute of housing age concern and other interested bodies a new <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the remarks of the institute of housing and of the article in a recent edition of <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> i believe that the new appproach which addresses the particular suitability of the dwelling for the elderly in its present state and the circumstances at the present letting is much more rational and satisfactory <e> <s> obviously such tests could well be met by older dwellings if they have been brought up to present-day standards <e> <s> this was proposed in another place and accepted in your lordships house without a division <e> <s> if i may i shall quote the words of the noble baroness lady birk at the time who was leading for the opposition in the housing and building control bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful for the opportunity to respond to this debate this evening on behalf of the government not only because i have been privileged to respond to such reports before but because i have followed the deliberations of the committee with close interest <e> <s> further-more the department for which i normally speak has a direct interest in the matter in hand <e> <s> indeed it has submitted oral or written evidence on no fewer than five occasions <e> <s> this was not all <e> <s> eight other government departments responded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that that is not so <e> <s> i said that it is expected that the fire authority will take over the staff but failing that for an interim period the residuary body will take it over <e> <s> that is only if arrangements cannot be made in time <e> <s> therefore i can give the staff the reassurance that the noble lord has asked me to give them <e>", "<cs> my lords the boroughs and districts have to make a positive decision that they do not want something <e> <s> if they do not want it to the best of my knowledge and belief that particular something will lapse <e>", "<cs> my lords we will get there with a little patience if you please from the house <e> <s> as the house will know local authorities have for a number of years set up private companies for a number of purposes <e> <s> they do so using their discretionary powers under section and of the local government act <e> <s> i understand as does the noble baroness lady david that legal doubts have been introduced <e> <s> i am advised that these concern particular types of company in particular circumstances <e> <s> the precise purpose of a given company and its relationship with its sponsoring authority may in the opinion of counsel create problems <e> <s> other legal views exist <e> <s> this is fairly muddy ground and it is still being churned over <e> <s> i am neither able nor qualified to offer a definitive legal view on the issues involved <e> <s> i can however assure the noble baroness that the government are watching developments closely and <e>", "<cs> my lords not at this moment but i will write to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to get through in a reasonable amount of time and i am attempting to cover as many points as i can <e> <s> if i am indistinct then i hope that i shall not be so indistinct when the noble lord comes to read the <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have welcomed the report of the joint study group under the chairmanship of mr watts chairman of the thames water authority which recommends extensive trials of domestic water metering <e> <s> we shall legislate at the earliest suitable opportunity and take other steps needed to make progress possible <e>", "<cs> my lords for all practical purposes the answer to my noble friends second supplementary question is yes <e> <s> it is true however that there is an under-registration at very low flow rates but this is of no practical significance because of the small amounts of water involved <e> <s> in the first part of my noble friends supplementary question i think he presupposes that we shall end up with compulsory metering but this is by no means certain <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is as is usual on this subject absolutely right <e> <s> i can confirm that since in the english water authorities areas only one in customers has thought the option worthwhile <e> <s> nevertheless it would appear at this moment before we have any compulsory trials to be a fair way of charging everybody for the amount of water used <e> <s> the point that my noble friend makes will of course have to be included in such consultations as we conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made the point that compulsory metering even if this statutory experiment is a success is by no means certain <e> <s> it is inevitable that it will depend on the cost-effectiveness in particular areas for particular households or groups of households and water authorities will have to decide on what arrangements are appropriate for their own consumers in their own particular areas or regions <e> <s> of course the consumer consultative committees of water authorities will be very much involved in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think it is one of the situations like that of micro-computers at the moment there is so little take-up <e> <s> the figures i gave my noble friend lord nugent illustrate this <e> <s> the charges are on average about a meter <e> <s> however the more meters are introduced obviously the lower the individual charge will become <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in the noble lords point <e> <s> i find it difficult to imagine that the charges <e>", "<cs> i understand that this would be the appropriate moment to take the statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already declared our firm intention to take effective action to protect swans from poisoning by anglers lead weights <e> <s> we will ban the sale of most lead weights for angling from st january if the voluntary approach supported by angling organisations has not proved successful by the end of the current fishing season <e> <s> in addition my right honourable friends the minister of agriculture fisheries and food and the secretary of state for wales have issued a model by-law to water authorities so they can if they wish ban the use of lead weights for fishing in their areas <e> <s> the use of lead weights in royal parks will also have been fully phased out by the start of the next fishing season <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will remember that we made very firm commitments when this subject was under discussion in your lordships house last year and the government are sticking <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we have said quite clearly that we will give the anglers and the angling organisations time to put their own house in order <e> <s> i have given a date for this which is th march this year <e> <s> if this does not come about we will legislate <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of a shotgun pellet is to kill <e> <s> the objective of a lead weight is to sink <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the manufacture and sale of lead-free substitutes is a very important point <e> <s> but there will be old stocks and we must make certain that we can ban the sale of lead shots in the circumstances that i have already described to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had constant discussions over the last year on the right way ahead and we are certain that we have come to the right solution <e> <s> i say again that should we need to legislate we will bring the matter forward for consultation and of course we will discuss it in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is a totally different question and i did not say that in the first place <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot comment on that <e> <s> but when i spoke of discussion i was referring to inter-departmental discussion about where we might go on legislation which is a rather different point <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the outside of the palace is concerned the stonework restoration programme will be more than half complete once the river frontage is finished this autumn <e> <s>

services agency which has suffered a number of brickbats in the recent past will be delighted by my noble friends comments <e> <s> i certainly agree with him that the clock tower is a magnificent achievement as is the work being conducted in the chamber <e> <s> with regard to his comment on the time-scale i would point out that the present programme started in and as i said in my main answer

what work should be tackled next <e> <s> he is fully aware of the importance of getting on with the work to the victoria tower which is the last remaining external area of the palace to be dealt with under the programme <e> <s> but he also has to bear in mind that the estimated cost of this would be in excess of million <e> <s> as to the scaffolding in the peers lobby final structural repairs have still to be completed <e> <s> the decorative ceiling panels have been removed and will be restored off-site this year <e> <s> when they will in fact be put back i am afraid i cannot tell the noble baroness <e> <s> nor can i comment on her assertion that funds will not be available in the next financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already answered that question in that i have admitted that i am unable to answer it <e> <s> however i shall put the noble baronesss point of view before my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn

house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> in spite of the fact that my speech has been paraphrased in three short sentences by the noble and learned lord it is with some relief that i answer the noble baroness turning as we do from the bill to the well travelled paths of the local government act <e> <s> in this respect it is not as well travelled in this house as it was in another place where this issue was discussed <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a point to the house <e> <s> i think it will be in the interests of all if i say that if everybody deducted the interruptions we would get into a fine mess by oclock <e> <s> i hope that perhaps this habit will not be continued too long <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments business sponsorship incentive scheme offers matching grants for new sponsorship <e> <s> this has already brought million of new money into the arts since it was set up in october including million worth of new sponsorship from industry and commerce <e> <s> in addition my right honourable friend the minister for the arts takes every opportunity as he visits different parts of the country to publicise the benefits of arts sponsorship to both parties <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that to the best of my knowledge and belief this is a countrywide scheme <e> <s> in regard to new ideas we are continually keeping the system under review <e> <s> the government have already done all kinds of things on the tax front to make it more sensible for businesses and individuals to give money to all charities not only to the arts and to make that more likely <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i disagree with the noble baroness <e> <s> the public subsidy for the arts is extremely generous as a basic level and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have read recent speculation in the press <e> <s> i do not think it would be right for me to comment on it beyond saying that my right honourable friend receives all kinds of advice good bad and plain lunatic in forming his budget <e> <s> i myself have even been known to contribute <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say as a regular visitor to glyndebourne which to the best of my knowledge and belief is entirely subsidised by private finance and has no government money at all that on many occasions they produce opera which i think would not otherwise see the light of day <e> <s> thus i do not see that the minority interest is always being neglected <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i should advise my noble friend and others in his position to get in touch with the association for business sponsorship of the arts which has three full-time regional people i was going to call them salesmen but directors might be a more appropriate term who have been very successful in the past year and who i have no doubt would like to help my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice and certainly not at question time can i go into detailed answers on such an exhaustive list as the noble lord lord hutchinson has just produced <e> <s> however what i will say as far as successor bodies and abolition are concerned is that they have been given per cent <e> <s> of the rate support grant that the senior bodies would have had in the coming year and therefore the fact that the money was spent in the past is no reason to suppose that it will not be spent in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the arts councils estimate in fact we had a mini-debate on it not very long ago and i am well aware of the provision my right honourable friend has made <e> <s> but this of course is extra to the per cent <e> <s> rate support grant figure that i mentioned just now to the noble lord lord hutchinson <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i most certainly agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i welcome all sponsorship wherever it occurs and from whomsoever it comes <e>", "<cs> in the interests of harmony i start by agreeing with one thing that the noble lord lord ardwick said <e> <s> he quoted subsection absolutely correctly <e> <s> why does the bill empower the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> in begging to move that the house do now resume i should say that it is not proposed to return to this bill until five past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord elliott of morpeth for raising this issue <e> <s> i agree perhaps for the first time this evening with the noble baroness lady david that this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> but i should perhaps put it in the context of clause which requires local authorities to keep a separate account of their expenditure on publicity and which makes an important step toward accountability in local authorities publicity spending <e>", "<cs> i think i should make it quite clear that it is certainly no part of the governments intention that the publicity provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> i must start by saying that i am attracted in principle to my noble friends delegated if i may put it that way argument on road safety <e> <s> his intention is to make local authorities publish year-by-year the measures they take to fulfil their statutory responsibility for road safety under the and road traffic acts <e> <s> the government are well aware of the important role which local authorities have to play in road safety and recognise that while some authorities have a first-class record others have a great deal to learn <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no proposals to double the funds available to housing associations <e> <s> in the present public expenditure climate restraint is essential for our wider economic policy and there are other pressures on housing public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course we want to see fewer people in bed and breakfast accommodation and more people employed in the building industry but as i said in my original answer this must be set in the general context of public expenditure restraint <e> <s> i would point out to the noble lord lord hylton that for next year gross provision for capital expenditure on housing has been increased by million <e> <s> i readily accept that we have a little way to go but it is at least a start in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly prepared to take the advice of the noble lord and to look at this again but as i said we have made a small improvement in housing expenditure in our provision <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house knows my honourable friend the minister for housing urban affairs and construction has been looking in recent months at the future of the whole private rented sector <e> <s> he has still to announce his decisions on that review <e> <s> but i take my noble friends point that this is certainly a way forward and a realistic way forward <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot go as far as that and the noble lord well knows why i cannot <e> <s> with regard to his substantive point on the original question of the noble lord lord hylton yes to a great extent i agree with the noble lord but he goes further than the debate <e> <s> the report of the inquiry into british housing says at page that the role of local authorities should be <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that that was a question i would say that all policies of any government take a certain amount of time to come to fruition <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with my noble friend as far as he goes but the solution to the problem does not lie simply in building a lot of new homes <e> <s> after all that approach saddled us with the unwanted enormous council estates we have today <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the noble baroness that to put homeless families into bed and breakfast accommodation is a policy of absolute last resort <e> <s> that is why ever since and i believe under the previous government too local authorities have been encouraged not to use such accommodation unless all other avenues have been totally closed to them <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot tell the noble lord the leader of the opposition the answers to his questions <e> <s> it is an internal review for my right honourable friends own purposes it is neither a statutory nor a public review <e> <s> nonetheless when decisions upon it have been reached the house will most certainly know <e>", "<cs> my lords if i answered my noble friend by saying exactly which aspects the review is examining i would be going further than i should properly go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering this question at the moment <e> <s> nonetheless i certainly take the point of the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> it only goes to prove that in this as in any other area of government priorities must first be identified and then realised <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot answer my noble friend on that i simply do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i would do so if i could be assured that it would not lead to yet another increase in inflation which i am assured by those economists who have advised me and my right honourable friend in the past that it most certainly would do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps we are getting into a little procedural difficulty <e> <s> we are on the report stage <e> <s> as my noble friend is explaining himself in a material part of what he said originally i am sure that if he asked the leave of the house he would get it <e> <s> nonetheless perhaps he would very kindly ask for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be proper for my noble friend to speak to both <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further consideration of this bill on report be now adjourned may i say that we shall not return to this bill until at least oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that the house do now adjourn i am sure that my noble friends would like me to express the governments gratitude for your lordships speedy consideration of the bill and the good humour with which the proceedings have been conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the committee moves to clause i think it would be right to make a short business statement which is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the three docklands boroughs newham southwark and tower hamlets are among the housing stress areas in which the housing corporation are concentrating new fair rent approvals for their programme <e> <s> in the housing corporation approved new fair rent and low cost home ownership schemes with a value of over million in the docklands area of these boroughs <e> <s> we have no proposals at present to allocate further special funds to the housing corporation for new fair rent schemes in docklands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that this is quite correct <e> <s> the total population of the eight square miles of the london dockland development corporations area is <e> <s> approximately per cent <e> <s> of those people live in council accommodation per cent <e> <s> are owner-occupiers and the remaining per cent <e> <s> have other forms of tenure <e> <s> on the fair rent approvals in the million that i have mentioned this amounts to million <e> <s> money is also given by the individual boroughs and they are also building houses themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say as i did in my original answer that million was given by the housing corporation to housing associations in docklands for the sort of schemes that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i fully understand and he has been at pains to point out the political situation in southwark but it is interesting to note that the comparison for extra housing association money in the three london boroughs concerned has risen from million in to million in <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can willingly give that undertaking <e> <s> this is why the government have asked the housing corporation to identify and to concentrate resources on the areas of particularly high need including manchester parts of bristol and elsewhere in the country <e> <s> it has produced a list of stress areas which i have mentioned <e> <s> it is right that within the resources available the areas to concentrate on should be those where the needs are greatest <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the housing corporations preferred option in its first corporate plan was to double the current programme but it is right to point out that this would cost million a year and as i said in my answer to the noble lord lord hylton on th march last this has to be done within our general and very successful economic policies <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the responsibility of birmingham city council to make and promote its own bid <e> <s> in doing so the city has sought government support to enable it to meet the requirements of the olympic charter and to help birmingham secure the nomination to host the games <e> <s> the government are giving that support <e>", "<cs> my lords the chief request of the birmingham city council was for an indemnity against losses arising from the games <e> <s> the government have agreed to guarantee only losses in excess of million <e> <s> so far as concerns the other part of the noble lords question we are giving full support and will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i totally agree with everything the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i recommend her to read the birmingham olympic bid publication <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the nedo report as a useful contribution to the continuing debate on home improvement <e> <s> i note that the report does not recommend a state fund as such but that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been considering that consistently since <e> <s> during that period a record sum of nearly billion has been spent on home improvement grants <e> <s> spending last year was million and was considerably higher than in the best year of the labour government million in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am too young to have the memory of the operation of schedule a that the noble and learned lord obviously has <e> <s> i shall however consider his request though i think that it is wide of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say that it is a grey area and that the one slides into the other <e> <s> i think that both questions are relevant to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords nedo means national economic development council <e> <s> i am not sure whether the report is in the library but if it is not i shall make certain that a copy is placed there <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i gave were in cash terms <e> <s> i have already made it clear that we are in fact increasing gross provision for improvement grants <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures on those in greatest need but we are to have a debate on that subject on wednesday week and i shall be delighted to provide them then <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider that point but of course local councils provide a short list under the right-to-repair scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords because my mathematics are not quick enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look at that but at the moment i have no evidence to suggest that it is a major problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is essentially about private house owners and it is not only centrally funded money which comes into that it is equally a matter for the local authorities financial institutions and of course the federation of housebuilders and repairers <e>", "<cs> my lords we are about to have a modern version of the report on the state of the housing stock the figures for which will be available in mid- <e> <s> based on that we will then make our policy absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords by definition the audit commissions report was concerned more with money than with the actual state of houses <e> <s> what we need to know is the actual state of houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recent report on housing was the ama one on the state of london housing <e> <s> i note with interest though i have been able to glance at it only fairly cursorily so far it was received at the department only last monday that while there has been little change in the level of disrepair since there has been considerable progress in reducing the number of properties that are either unfit or lack basic amenities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> of course as i said in my original answer our policy is to direct help to those who most need it <e> <s> equally by definition that seems to be a favourite phrase of mine in answering these questions they are very unlikely to be paying tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will be helpful to the house if i answer this question in terms of new projects <e> <s> outside the designated housing stress areas where the housing corporation has been asked to concentrate its new approvals in the total scheme costs of new fair rent and home ownerships approvals in will be million <e> <s> this is just under per cent <e> <s> of the million lotal scheme costs for new projects in these areas in <e>", "<cs> my lords housing associations are only part of a housing programme but i point out that the government have provided for a programme by the housing corporation of million in england in <e> <s> together with the funding of housing associations by local authorities which was about million in that will enable the housing associations to make a substantial contribution towards meeting housing need <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords general point i think that this total provision for housing both with the housing association movement and outside it is a sensible way of running a housing programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that my noble friends figures concentrate entirely on housing corporation grant in the areas that he mentioned <e> <s> on one matter i agree with the official opposition housing is about people and where there are particular needs in an area that is where we shall concentrate our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords it is awfully easy to think that the answer to all our problems lies in more and more and newer and newer money <e> <s> but where on earth is it to come from <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a decision by the housing corporation on a request for reconsideration of its policy by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have are as usual in cash terms <e> <s> i note that in that period expenditure went down by per cent <e> <s> in the period of the last labour government on exactly the same basis expenditure went down by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until five minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be doubly grateful to my noble friend lady vickers <e> <s> first she agreed through the usual channels to postpone this debate from a very late hour on tuesday th april until today and secondly she has today successfully drawn our attention once more to the problems of houses in multiple occupation <e>

multiple occupation or hmo and has drawn attention to the people who live in these properties and the conditions which sadly they can experience <e> <s> i agree generally with what has been said here and i do not propose to go over the same ground <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will follow through with my speech just a little further he will find that i shall meet his point exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that a speech ought to be taken as a whole and not in little bits <e> <s> how easy it is for an opposition to find fault with a government any government in the exercise of their duties <e> <s> ah <e> <s> what it is to have instant forgettery <e> <s> the labour party when in government took no steps whatsoever to change those powers into duties <e> <s> my noble friend on the other hand is prodding us to do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords in a minute <e> <s> as the noble lord lord dean has said there is one area where this government have acted and i believe rightly so <e> <s> in recent years there has been much concern about fire safety in hmos <e> <s> the risk of being a casualty in a fire in an hmo is about five times greater than the risk in a single-dwelling occupied dwelling <e> <s> indeed i was deeply affected yesterday when i went round a house in multiple occupation where two people died and one was rescued unconscious in a fire on boxing day last year <e> <s> that made me realise why the government have concentrated their actions on hmos in the area of protection from fire <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord dean has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> as the noble lord lord donaldson will understand very well i was talking about conversion of powers into duties <e> <s> we are discussing what governments have done unprodded the noble lord did some prodding and so did my noble friend over the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i honestly do not think that it helps the house to prolong this argument further <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the length of this answer <e> <s> according to information provided to the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy by local authorities in england and wales their net expenditure on hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation for households accepted as homeless was some million in / <e> <s> provisional annual expenditure for great britain on all supplementary benefit payments to people in board and lodging accommodation including bed and breakfast accomodation guesthouses and hostels at december is some million <e> <s> it is estimated that some per cent <e> <s> of this relates to unemployed claimants <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the publication to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> i

authorities have very high numbers of empty flats and council accommodation generally which could be made available quite speedily <e> <s> they do not do that on the whole for political reasons <e>

concerns homeless families which i understand to be the noble lords particular worry finding permanent accommodation for homeless families is of course a major priority for local authorities in the

i should have added that a partial exception is given in the case of the channel islands isle of man and gibraltar which we discussed in the last series of amendments <e> <s> the commission which would make any enabling order for these territories would be given discretion to disapply the adoption requirement in these cases <e> <s> this is because the government regard lending in these territories simply as an extension of the power to lend on united kingdom land and not as a new departure in itself <e> <s> the detail has been delegated to a statutory instrument purely because there

discussions taking place on detailed planned spending for the following year <e> <s> all sorts of speculations exist but no member of the government can tell the house what the outcome of the discussions will be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one effect of the shortage <e> <s> another factor is that many people come to the south-east to pursue employment and therefore need houses <e> <s> it is no secret that we are looking at ways to diversify the pattern of the rented sector indeed that is already under way for example by housing trusts and tenants co-operatives and in direct provision by building societies as we discussed last thursday in connection with the building societies bill <e> <s> i accept that much more needs to be done but i welcome the fact that the halifax building society estimates that with the provisions in the bill it could build houses a year for rent in needy areas by <e>", "<cs> my lords the report makes the valid point that average rents do not cover

no overall political control of that scheme and that the alliance appears to be voting with the labour party in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords only a small amount of time has elapsed since the london residuary body was set up <e> <s> sales are proceeding <e> <s> if i gave an answer today i have no doubt that by next week the figure would be totally different <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to my noble friend i do not think that i can do better than refer her to the answer i gave to the supplementary question of the noble baroness opposite <e> <s> however all these things will become much clearer <e> <s> i was aware of the appeals meeting <e> <s> i assume that this means although i do not actually know that there is still some money for future donations <e> <s> i understand that the london voluntary service council is shortly to publish some research on this very subject <e> <s> this is perhaps an occasion when an earlier supplementary from the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee might be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that the taper does not make the slightest bit of difference for the simple reason that the precept as stated during discussion of the bill in this house and in another place has been divided pro rata among the boroughs <e> <s> as i said just now although i am very interested to hear the views of the noble lord lord graham and of my noble friend lady gardner of parkes the lvsc is shortly to publish some research on the subject <e> <s> we shall then all be in a very much better position to make up our minds <e>", "<cs> no my lords i must confess that i was not aware of the glcs policy on computers vis--vis the voluntary bodies to which the noble lord lord avebury has just referred <e> <s> the correct avenue in the case of a one-borough voluntary service is the borough <e> <s> if it spans more than one borough it is of course the richmond scheme <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that i would for the simple reason that the widdicombe inquiry was a very comprehensive look at the financing arrangements of the whole of local government <e> <s> i do not believe that particular bits of it which appeal to particular parties or individuals should be as it were plucked like plums out of a christmas pudding <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is relevant to this question <e>", "<cs> my lords in my limited experience of these matters both as an ex-small businessman and an ex-chairman of a voluntary body i know that the two groups are equally paranoid on the subject of future funding <e> <s> there is nothing new in this <e> <s> on the case to which the noble baroness refers i know perfectly well that i am not in a position to give that kind of commitment this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that he will not be in the house later this evening but by that stage many of your lordships in an enforced capacity will probably have heard too much of my voice <e> <s> to answer his supplementary question consultations are in progress upon the matter of the environmentally sensitive areas <e> <s> two have already been announced in the last week in scotland at breadalbane and loch lomond five in england namely the broads the somerset levels and moors the pennine dales west penwith and the eastern end of the south downs <e> <s> there is also one in wales in the cambrian mountains <e> <s> the procedure is that once the consultation period is complete my right honourable friend the secretary of state will ratify his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greateful to the noble lord for his introductory comments <e> <s> we are not talking about a new body we are talking about a new sort of area <e> <s> the existing bodies the countryside commissions the councils for national parks the local planning authorities and in special cases the nature conservancy council will be the bodies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this government have a very good record on green belts <e> <s> we shall be going into the question rather more fully when i answer the starred question of my noble friend lord brougham and vaux on friday <e> <s> the government are firmly committed to the protection of the green belts but at the same time we need to achieve that delicate balance between conservation and growth <e> <s> since we came to power we have more than doubled the area of approved green belts and maintained the presumption against inappropriate development in them as provided for in the original green belt circular no <e> <s> of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble baroness is absolutely correct <e> <s> the report of course covers very much more than forestry and in fact very much more than agriculture <e> <s> it is a land-use report for the whole country generally and as she says goes up to <e> <s> there have been questions about the quality of the background information on which the report was based and of course these are being investigated <e>", "<cs> i agree my lords and this is why it is so difficult to understand the position taken by those people who regard the green belt as being in their words totally sacrosanct <e> <s> of course there must be nibbling on occasions but the legislation provides that replacement land must be given in exchange <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord makes a very valid point and everything i have said about designated areas incidentally i have not mentioned sites of special scientific interest but they would be included is of course equally valid for the rest of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords great discussions are currently going on within government on this matter <e> <s> every now and then little snippets about them get into the media <e> <s> for example the noble lord will know there is a suggestion that there should be forestry on much of the surplus land <e> <s> the noble lord has his view on that obviously but as i say there is still much <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on record as saying that i do not believe in living in a country which has a glass-case countryside policy <e> <s> i think perhaps that covers my noble friends supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to that is that the broads scheme has been an outstanding success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend he is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am rather flabbergasted that the noble baroness should i think be the fifth of your lordships this afternoon to congratulate me on my appointment <e> <s> i am also somewhat flattered <e> <s> so far as concerns her introductory remarks on the amount of time that the usual channels agreed to give this bill i should have thought that perhaps it would be more proper for this to be a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> on the question for written answer to which she referred i did indeed arrange for it to be answered yesterday <e> <s> with the best will in the world i cannot be responsible for the happenings surrounding the <e>", "<cs> that is exactly why i made the offer i did in my initial response to the amendment <e> <s> it is most important that we all agree to get it right and <e>", "<cs> i never expected perhaps because i am nave that when i proposed the amendment we should have a whole debate short though it has been on the exercise of the right to buy <e> <s> but each noble lord has done just that perhaps i may say that exercising the right to buy does not make one more house available for letting <e> <s> it does not make any difference to this countrys housing stock <e>", "<cs> yes it would <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to turn to the amendment <e> <s> the committee has questioned whether it is right that the government should ask either house of parliament or both houses to agree to an order-making power in a case such as this <e> <s> this bill represents the second time that the government in primary legislation have asked this chamber to change the discount structure <e> <s> as my noble friend lord elton said on second reading there must be a simpler way <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said exactly that <e> <s> there is a simpler way <e> <s> that is what i have presented to the committee in the amendment <e>", "<cs> on second reading as has been pointed out in discussion on the last amendment my noble friend lord elton made no secret of the fact that very few flats have so far been sold under the right to buy <e> <s> we all know that <e> <s> i freely admit it <e> <s> there is no <e>", "<cs> they are allowed to through the low-cost home ownership scheme <e> <s> i had a delegation from one district council to see me yesterday in the department <e> <s> they expressed the same surprise that the noble lord lord dean has <e> <s> but they and officials in my department are to examine the position together to see whether it would help their housing needs <e>", "<cs> i must say that my noble friends amendments are quite ingenious in providing for the amount of discount to be repaid on the resale of a property purchased under the right to buy to be reduced in accordance with the former tenants tenancy record <e> <s> my noble friend obviously sees no objection in principle or logic to allowing those with a long previous tenancy history to get away without <e>", "<cs> the discount to which a tenant is entitled in exercising the right to buy normally depends on how long he or she has been a public sector tenant or has occupied armed forces accommodation <e> <s> the tenants discount qualification is expressed as a percentage of the market value of the property <e> <s> that is not however the end of the story <e> <s> in his concluding remarks my noble friend asked for what is in fact already on the statute book in section of the housing act which already places limits on the amount of discount which may be allowed in cash terms <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord lord dean has made <e> <s> this is exactly the sort of subject that will be under consideration if and when we decide to produce an order and lay it before parliament <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i am slightly dumbfounded by the speech of the noble lord <e> <s> i rather resent the government being accused of tagging things about scotland on to the end of clause <e> <s> may i advise the noble lord to please look at the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can deal with one charge at a time and i should have thought they were rather different charges <e>", "<cs> it is a separate clause <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure where that leaves us <e> <s> at some point in his speech the noble lord lord ross said that he did not want me to adduce the same arguments as i did on the english equivalent of this particular piece of proposed legislation and therefore i thihk perhaps my proper response would be silence <e> <s> i accordingly seek the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i was extremely interested to hear the quotation from the letter made by the noble lord lord dean at the end of his speech because this is what clause is about <e> <s> it is about a tenant considering exercising the right to buy wanting to know exactly what is entailed and what possible charges there will be for example for repairs to those parts of the building that he does not own after he has actually purchased the property <e>", "<cs> no i cannot let the noble lord get away with that <e> <s> i do not have doubts about what <e>", "<cs> in the case that the noble baroness cites if there were no right-to-buy sales in a block all the money required for repairs would have to come from the usual mixture of central and local government finance <e> <s> i do not see that that point gets us any further <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the burden does go back to the council house tenant <e> <s> the whole object of the amendment is to let the tenant who wants to exercise his right to buy know in advance what his share of the cost of repairing the common parts of the building will be in the foreseeable future <e> <s> we are not talking about his own flat <e>", "<cs> i spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> to with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to move them <e>", "<cs> it might perhaps be simpler for the chair if i moved amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> again i think we are back with the basic misunderstanding about this clause which both my noble friend and i have tried to explain to the committee <e> <s> before i go any further i should say that in the case the noble baroness has mentioned with cladding falling off walls and the contractors going in to do the whole repair the wall would be a common part <e>", "<cs> the outside wall <e> <s> but if the inside of that wall was part of the leaseholders flat the leaseholder himself would be responsible for the inside <e> <s> however if he were not a leaseholder and i <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> a tenant who moves into a block of flats after they have been improved or repaired and then exercises the right to buy would find that that improvement would be reflected in the price of the flat <e> <s> so yes at the end of the day the tenant would have to pay <e>", "<cs> i am a little confused by the concerted opposition attack on this set of amendments and indeed on the clause which they seek to amend because i genuinely believe that the effect of these provisions has been completely and utterly misunderstood <e> <s> the more i heard noble lords opposite the more i was genuinely convinced that i was right and that they have been misunderstood <e>", "<cs> i am talking about page on the marshalled list and paragraph of the new schedule <e> <s> i am talking about paragraph <e>", "<cs> assuming this bill becomes an act in the form in which i hope it will that procedure will be totally invalid because it is illegal <e> <s> i will get to the point about paragraph in a minute <e> <s> what i was talking about was what the effect on the tenants will be and the noble lord came back to me quite reasonably and said well shouldnt the secretary of state be the promoter in all this rather than the tenant <e> <s> well of course neither is the promoter in all this <e> <s> the promoter in all this is the local authority who wants to pass the building over to a private sector landlord <e> <s> it starts the ball rolling and then you have statutory consultation with the tenants under previous enactments <e> <s> that statutory consultation must take place as a result of the consultation the tenants then have to make up their minds from their own point of view whether they think the landlord is doing the right thing <e> <s> they will then make their views known usually in a tenants referendum <e>", "<cs> on occasions the secretary of state as all secretaries of state do will suggest to a council that it consider that it might be through the urban housing renewal scheme for example that the right way to manage a property would be not to keep it in its own ownership but to pass it over to the private sector <e> <s> that happens from time to time now so the secretary of state may as i said in very few cases be involved in which case if the secretary of state is at fault it will be to the secretary of state that the tenants would have redress <e>", "<cs> there are two points here are there not <e> <s> the noble baroness started by expressing concern about tenants security of tenure <e> <s> of course the position is not exactly the same <e> <s> local authority tenants operate under one act of parliament and private sector tenanted property comes under another <e> <s> if the property in this case is sold to a private sector landlord the security of tenure of the sitting tenant would come under the rent acts <e> <s> that does not mean any loss absolutely none of security of tenure i am advised <e> <s> at the moment if after the transfer of the property the tenant applies to the rent officer for a fair rent he can do so <e> <s> but it means that the new landlord will know what his rental income is only after he has bought the property <e> <s> that seems fairly straightforward <e> <s> the amendment enables the proposed new owner of the property to make a judgment in advance of purchase <e> <s> it may well be the case with a good local authority where the rents are reasonable that the situation described by the noble baroness of a rent lower than the fair rent would not apply <e> <s> equally the position may be that which she has described <e> <s> the noble baroness tempts me although at this time of night i shall resist the temptation to go into the whole question of local authorities as managers and owners of tenanted property <e> <s> i do not feel however that such remarks would be a service to the committee <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has not understood that we are talking about two totally separate matters <e> <s> in this new clause we are talking about the fair rent that the property would attract if it was in the private sector in exactly the same state as it now is <e> <s> in other words the landlord has had a good indication of how much rental income he will get if he buys the property <e>", "<cs> my nanny always told me that it is better to live in hope <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge and belief the words disponor and disponee are normal language of the law <e> <s> if i am wrong in that i shall advise the noble baroness as soon as possible <e> <s> but i am fairly certain that noble and learned lords and indeed learned gentlemen of any description would understand readily what these mean <e>", "<cs> with the exception that i described it is not changing anything at all <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that everything that should be on the record is on the record <e> <s> when she reads it it will not be tomorrow now it will be the next day she will understand absolutely everything <e>", "<cs> i must say that after sitting through the committee for all the committees working day i rather thought that nothing i would say would surprise the noble baroness but we shall see <e> <s> first i fail to be convinced that we should limit the granting of orders to cases in which demolition is proposed or in which substantial works are needed to the dwelling so that the tenant could not live there while the works were in progress <e> <s> perhaps i am about to surprise the noble baroness <e> <s> this is because it may be desirable in some cases to redevelop an estate as a whole in circumstances where not all the dwelling-houses on the estate are to be subject to demolition or substantial works <e> <s> the ground for possession found in the new ground a is intended to help local authorities and other landlords of public sector tenancies to deal with their run-down estates by enabling them to sell those estates to the private sector for redevelopment or modernisation <e> <s> in such cases it may be necessary to recover the possession of all the dwelling-houses in order to bring the estates back into use as decent houses <e> <s> sales to the private sector will bring private capital into the process of bringing that housing back into full use <e> <s> that must be in everybodys interest <e>", "<cs> in a case like this what is best for the people is for the estate to be redeveloped but what i was trying to point out in my original answer to the noble baronesss amendment was that this amendment would remove the flexibility from local authorities that ground a is intended to give <e> <s> it may very well be that it is not necessary to move everybody on a particular redevelopment scheme in which case that should be allowed <e> <s> on the other hand it might very well be that it is necessary to move everybody in a redevelopment scheme in which case that should he allowed <e> <s> all i am asking for is for the law to allow local authorities because it is local authorities we are talking about in the first instance to be able to keep their options open <e>", "<cs> we are talking in this case about a management decision <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> i understand the objectives of the noble lord lord dean of beswick but i fear that the effect of this amendment would be rather different from what i think he anticipates <e> <s> very often <e> <s> a large number of tenants will have already vacated the estate at their own request leaving properties empty and hard to let <e> <s> the noble lord as past chairman of a local housing authority in manchester will know this situation very well indeed <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to change the factors which the secretary of state or the housing corporation must take into account in deciding whether or not to approve a redevelopment scheme proposed by a local authority or a housing association <e> <s> these factors were inserted in response to calls in committee in another place for the secretary of state to be bound to take into account certain key matters for example any representations made to him or the effect of the scheme on the extent and character of the housing in the neighbourhood <e> <s> the list was not intended to be comprehensive hence the <e>", "<cs> are not precedents wonderful things <e> <s> indeed i produced some precedents on an earlier amendment as the noble baroness will remember <e> <s> the important thing about precedents is that they are useful only when they are pertinent to the case in point <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are obviously intended to maximise the compensation paid to a secure tenant displaced from his or her home under a possession order under ground or new ground a of schedule to the act <e> <s> to all but the landlords concerned that is no doubt a laudable objective <e> <s> it is therefore a little hard for me to have to say that the amendments are either redundant or wrong in principle <e>", "<cs> i believe that the bill as it stands together with the amendments proposed by the government giving tenants an effective veto on the delegation of management goes a long way towards meeting the concerns expressed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is being unduly suspicious especially at this time of night <e> <s> where all three organisations the secretary of state if i may be allowed to call him or her an organisation the local authority and the tenants concerned are wanting to try out a new management team then i really do not see what there is to be suspicious about <e>", "<cs> i am interested in the fact that the noble lord has seen fit to move the amendment but i fully appreciate why he has done so <e> <s> i understood that he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and when he moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i know that in committee this afternoon the noble lord has zeroed-in as it were on the need for public inquiries <e> <s> i have sought to explain to him that public inquiries are all very well in their context but that in this case they would remove the right from tenants which the government are keen to give them and about which the opposition are suspicious <e> <s> i do not feel that public inquiries are appropriate in this case <e> <s> tenants have what i have described over and over again as a veto <e> <s> what more could tenants want <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree that that should be encouraged but i am not quite sure that the rating system is the way to do it <e> <s> as with all methods of rating the valuation officer in applying the so-called contractors test is merely seeking to ascertain the rates on the basis of the rent which a hypothetical tenant would be prepared to pay for the property <e> <s> i appreciate that new technologies and one-off projects have high capital costs which can result in a higher rateable value <e> <s> but this matter is not inflexible and ultimately the valuation officers assessment can be tested as in the ilfracombe case by the local valuation board <e>", "<cs> my lords all sorts of people live in windy areas <e> <s> i do myself <e>", "<cs> my lords the only difference between scotland and england and wales is that in the formulation of the contractors test the scots have a written-down value of per cent <e> <s> and in england and wales it is per cent <e> <s> there is very little difference indeed <e>", "<cs> no my lords but the shed itself may be rated <e>", "<cs> my lords this is rather different <e> <s> the special arrangements for the cegb and the scottish generating boards are there because those boards cover an area of more than one local authority <e> <s> therefore the rates are different and special arrangements have to be made <e> <s> at the moment to the best of my knowledge there is no wind-generated power fed <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware that the department of energy is giving priority to wind-generated electricity and i can assure the noble lord that whatever the outcome at ilfracombe my colleagues in both departments will discuss it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and as i said i will take up this particularly difficult matter to make sure that if it is unfair it will not continue to be unfair <e> <s> however i should point out that new technologies and one-off experimental projects as i said to my noble friend earlier have always been rated <e> <s> therefore it is quite logical that wind-generating turbines should also be rated <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to get into a discussion at question time this afternoon but that seems to be an admirable reason for disapplying the rates altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at that in my general consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i readily agree with the noble baroness that this is a very difficult area and as she will know the proposal to make relationship breakdown a ground for possession is by no means new <e> <s> it was extensively discussed at the time of both the housing act and the housing and building control act <e> <s> it was resisted then principally on the ground that it would be more appropriate for questions about the future of the matrimonial home to be settled by the courts under matrimonial legislation than by a public sector landlord <e> <s> i hope the committee will agree that this argument still has considerable force <e> <s> it is however true that matrimonial legislation does not provide a means of assigning the family home to a so-called common-law spouse which is a problem bound up in this whole general area <e> <s> there are situations where a spouse is unwillng to take the initiative under matrimonial legislation as it now stands <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness responds perhaps i may reply to both the noble baroness lady fisher and her noble friend lord carmichael <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to say to the latter that i am fully apprised of the fact that this <e>", "<cs> i am extremely interested in what the noble lord said and especially the remarks he made at the beginning of his speech when he talked if i understood him correctly about the illegal manipulation of the lists <e> <s> such an illegal manipulation can of course be challenged in the courts <e> <s> the committee may have heard of a recent case where an applicant successfully challenged by judicial review canterbury councils refusal to admit her to the waiting list and so we do not need this new clause to deal with that point <e>", "<cs> that is a fair point <e> <s> equally if i read it aright under the new clause the matter would have to go to court and someone would have to take it to court <e> <s> obviously the local authority will not take it to court <e>", "<cs> no i meant that since i am living and working in westminster i would be very unlikely to get a house this was the point i was seeking to make but i would be able under the proposed clause to get on westminsters housing list <e>", "<cs> that is all very well but the point i was making was that i have read my departments report and have understood clearly what it says <e> <s> but i cannot see any justification for me at my age as an owner-occupier elsewhere in the country being allowed to join a waiting list for a possible house in westminster <e> <s> i honestly do not think it would be right and i am sure many noble lords would agree with me <e>", "<cs> yet again i fully understand the noble lords aim in moving this amendment which is to be fair to council tenants affected by proposed sales to a third party <e> <s> however i hope that on this occasion at least i can convince the noble lord that not only is his amendment unnecessary but that it could in some cases frustrate the wishes of the very people it is intended to help namely the tenants themselves <e>", "<cs> if the sale takes place it can only be with the consent of the majority of the tenants <e> <s> inevitably as with a general election a council election or anything else if there is a majority by definition there must be a minority <e>", "<cs> maybe but perhaps the noble lord has forgotten that no government since the war have been elected by more than per cent <e> <s> of the voting population so i do not see that there is validity in that argument <e> <s> i would add that under the provisions that the committee has already approved the local authority will have to certify to the secretary of state that all the tenants affected have been consulted and such certificate must be accompanied by copies of the consultation documents served on the tenants <e> <s> if the secretary of state is not satisfied that tenants have been given adequate information he will have the power to require the local authority to carry out further consultations <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord was working himself up to ask the opinion of the committee <e> <s> before he gets to that point it is only fair to tell him that sitting tenants on disposal do not lose all their statutory rights <e> <s> they will become rent act tenants and have the preserved right to buy <e> <s> i should have thought that those were valuable continuing rights <e>", "<cs> indeed i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the point i was trying to make is that rights under the rent act as opposed to rights under the housing acts are very little different <e> <s> when the noble baroness on another point talks about housing being taken over by the private sector she must remember that all this discussion that we have had both on tuesday and today centres around the fact that it is the local authority themselves who want to pass it over to the private sector and that it is the tenants in that situation who have the right of veto to prevent it <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord has got it wrong again <e> <s> it has never been the governments intention to phase out the rent acts never ever ever <e>", "<cs> i do not have the copy of <e>", "<cs> they have all sorts of things do they not <e> <s> for example they have a right to a mortgage they have a right to repair <e> <s> we have been talking about a right for common part grants and we have been talking about all sorts of rights over the past few days <e>", "<cs> i was slightly confused at the beginning of the noble baronesss explanation because she obviously had not taken on board something which her noble friend lord elystan-morgan said just now <e> <s> as i understood it and i sure he will immediately correct me if i am wrong he said that there was no ideal solution in this matter and he gave some rather convincing arguments against having a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord seriously suggesting that a minority should be able to veto the wishes of a majority <e> <s> if so as i said in my original speech or rather in response to one of the noble lords on the front bench opposite that would turn our electoral system upside down <e>", "<cs> i really must protest to the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> only under an inquiry he said would the tenant have a right to be heard <e> <s> under the bill the tenants must be consulted all the tenants must be consulted by the local authority <e> <s> in the case of a public inquiry as we all know only those people who want to put in objections to the inquiry actually do so <e> <s> under this bill there is a strengthened right over any public inquiry anywhere in the land <e> <s> all the tenants must be consulted <e> <s> not only must all the tenants be consulted but a majority must agree <e> <s> i really cannot see how noble lords opposite can get away from those simple facts in the bill <e>", "<cs> i said over and over again on tuesday that the tenants must be informed <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard asked how the tenant would make his view known <e> <s> it has to be in writing <e> <s> that is the first answer to his question <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> he or somebody else on his behalf has to be able to write <e> <s> he has to be able to make his mark <e> <s> he has to be able to affirm or whatever is necessary in his particular case <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> it should not be just throwing literature through the letter-box <e> <s> it will not be just throwing literature through the letter-box because the tenants as i have just explained to her noble friend lord stallard have to give a positive answer <e> <s> the secretary of state will receive both the paper that goes out and the signatures or the written evidence which comes in of the tenants approval <e> <s> the secretary of state can then decide whether or not the information that was given to the tenants was adequate <e> <s> if he decides that it was not adequate the process has to start again <e> <s> i should have thought that this was real consultation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my attention was slightly distracted <e> <s> will the noble baroness be good enough to repeat her question and i will answer yes or no <e>", "<cs> no i have obviously totally confused the committee or at least those members on the opposition side <e> <s> what will happen is that the local authority will consult on a specific scheme which it decides is right for the tenants the property the land the buildings and everything else <e> <s> it will consult on a specific proposal and on that specific proposal the tenants have a right of veto <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> in replying to the noble lord lord sefton i must make this my final speech on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord said that i have no regard for the position of the minority <e> <s> i have said over and

reasonably to cope with it at the moment <e> <s> i hope that i may be allowed to write to my noble friend on that point <e>", "<cs> i referred to the monitoring which is a survey of all housing

that is summer <e> <s> i do not know whether members of the committee will consider that satisfactory but that is the answer that i must give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord for one second <e> <s> will he allow me to speak to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> at the same time as responding to his <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to the provisions of clause which extends the assured tenancy scheme to property which has been improved repaired or converted <e> <s> the extension of the scheme was welcomed by all parties in another place but i must say that from the speech of the noble lord lord dean i did not sense that he disapproved of the basic tenets of clause <e>", "<cs> we shall come to that point in due course <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is a government amendment <e> <s> it provides that an approved body cannot let property on an assured tenancy under the extension to the scheme unless it is fit for human habitation <e> <s> the test of fitness for human habitation which we have chosen is closely based on that in section of the housing act with which we had a little play before dinner in turn derived from the housing act and earlier legislation <e> <s> as it will also be necessary for a substantial sum to have been spent on works to the property the standard of accommodation provided will in the great majority of cases be well above the fitness standard <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that tenancies granted under the assured tenancy scheme are subject to broadly the same statutory regime as that which applies to business tenancies <e> <s> market rents may be charged and the tenant has the right to renew his lease <e> <s> section of the landlord and tenant act to which the amendment refers put simply allows landlord and tenant to contract out of the act with the consent of the court <e> <s> there is that valid safeguard <e>", "<cs> i think we agreed that amendments nos <e> <s> and were to be taken together <e>", "<cs> landlords who have their approval withdrawn are already prevented under the assured tenancy legislation from creating any further assured tenancies <e> <s> the effect of these amendments would be to deprive them of their existing assured tenancies presumably by converting them into tenancies to which the rent acts would apply <e>", "<cs> i am glad we heard the word tenants just now from the noble baroness <e> <s> but before i respond to that point the noble lord lord graham sought to make capital out of the number of assured tenancies <e> <s> in answer to a point on the last amendment it may be correct to tell him that the department carries out an annual survey of approved bodies <e> <s> the last survey was carried out in april and there is a copy in the library <e> <s> that is where the figure i produced earlier came from <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord i think perhaps it would be fair to point out that if approved the oppositions amendments would not only penalise landlords who lost their approved status but would also damage the tenants interests <e> <s> assured tenancies may normally be freely assigned unless the lease includes a specific prohibition on assignment or requires that the landlords consent be obtained <e> <s> the assured tenant may pay a premium for his lease and may have the right to assign it at a premium <e> <s> if as the amendment proposes the removal of the landlords approved status causes any tenancies he has granted to cease to be assured tenancies they become regulated tenancies <e> <s> in these circumstances the tenant would in most cases lose any right which he may have to assign the tenancy at a premium <e> <s> if he himself has paid a premium for the lease he would therefore suffer a financial loss <e>", "<cs> i can do no more than repeat the assurance i gave in answer to the last amendment that we will consult and consult rapidly on that <e>", "<cs> i am advised by the table that the numbers are kept the same but the clauses have been re-ordered so that they fit in with the motion which i think my noble friend lord elton passed on the ordering of clauses for this bill <e>", "<cs> i am

pertinent thoughts to a subject through almost first-hand knowledge <e> <s> many of us have to suffer at least from time to time from not being entirely sure what we are talking about <e> <s> i would say to the noble baroness that if you buy a picture you expect to be allowed to sell it <e> <s> if you buy that part of your house the share that you own as opposed to the share that you rent why should it be any different <e> <s> that is my answer to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear it <e> <s> however we are talking about the same honourable friend of the noble baroness <e> <s> he suggested a reform of mortgage relief the words of the noble baroness <e> <s> that is not as i understand it but i take the word of the noble baroness <e> <s> the government have not proposed either reform or abandonment of mortgage relief <e> <s> i do not believe and this is very much an offhand remark that as an idea it has very much to commend it to my honourable friend the minister for housing <e>", "<cs> all rented property in this case the rented parts of property is covered by a lease which is entered into at the beginning of the letting period <e> <s> so again i may be getting extremely dim at this time of night but i simply do not understand the point made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> speaking from memory and i would have to check the facts as i suspect

noble friend lord elton in a written answer to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes announced that the government were prepared to consider proposals from new town corporations for the transfer of their housing to bodies other than local authorities <e> <s> we wish to ensure that the choice between a local authority and a non-local authority option for the remaining new town housing is not restricted by any provisions in the legislation concerning statutory transfer to the local authority <e>", "<cs> not all local authorities want to take new town housing <e> <s> halton borough council recently reaffirmed having been asked i think i am right in saying three times that is subject to confirmation that it wants nothing to do with the housing at runcorn <e> <s> so this is not an open and shut case <e> <s> i can sympathise to a certain extent with the spirit of the first part of the amendment <e> <s> my intention is that there would in practice be an opportunity for the council and non-council option to be put to the tenants and to other interested groups wherever that option arises as it may do in as many as five of the six new towns concerned <e> <s> i remain to be convinced that the climate for such consultation would be better if conducted against a rigid statutory framework <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord referring to any occasion even on the example that i quoted <e> <s> there are local authorities who specifically do not want new town housing <e> <s> there are occasions when it would not be appropriate to give it to housing associations <e> <s> is the the noble lord saying that we come into a glass-case situation and that the housing has to remain with the new town <e> <s> surely that cannot be right <e>", "<cs> i have taken up my responsibility for new towns only in the past three weeks <e> <s> i have not yet visited any of them <e> <s> i certainly intend to do so <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that there has been a policy for a number of years to wind up new towns <e> <s> if i knew my brief as well as i ought i should be able to rattle off the names of the new towns and the agreement that has been reached with them on the date by which to wind up <e> <s> i know that it is an ongoing <e>", "<cs> bearing the name that i do i can guess one of them <e> <s> to be serious i should have thought that in certain circumstances that was an argument for allowing new town housing to go into the private sector which has access to money and all sorts of ways to improve properties and make them more rentable than we are often told from the other side of the committee with the so-called restrictions on local authority housing expenditure would be possible for the local authorities <e> <s> therefore if i may respectfully say so to the noble lord it is an argument that cuts both ways <e>", "<cs> i take that point but the noble baroness should remind the committee of the date and the government at the time who set up the new town <e>

<s> however i take very much to heart the point that the noble baroness has made <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> i believe that it was the noble baroness lady stedman who earlier in this short debate spoke effectively about carrots and sticks <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness lady david the first time round i said that if the new town housing went to the local authorities the local authorities would inherit both the debt and the subsidy to go with it the carrot and stick if you like <e> <s> a housing association would get neither <e> <s> therefore there is an equality there

problem on all too many local authority housing estates not only in london but regrettably elsewhere in the country <e> <s> attacks and harassment directed at people because of their racial or ethnic origin must be tackled and stamped out <e>", "<cs> it has already been spoken to <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments commitment to the green belt policy is in itself a pressure to secure the use of these sites <e> <s> our urban programme of derelict land expenditure and the land register system are both designed to encourage the use of vacant land in city areas and of the under-used land owned by public bodies <e> <s> since mid- the total area of land removed from the register of unused or under-used publicly-owned land is acres of which acres an area larger than the city of stoke-on-trent has been disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that there have been difficulties with the farming community within the green belt area and this is one of the many matters of which my noble friend lord vinson as chairman of the development commission and its agency the council for small industries in rural areas is taking great account <e>", "<cs> my lords in this sense the local planning committees are part of local authorities and the governments remit to local authorities is to leave things up to the local authorities themselves <e> <s> what we are responsible for where there are cases coming to the department is keeping very careful watch that the results are considered and published as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble baroness has asked that question <e> <s> circular / published on th july is indeed the definitive statement on green belt land <e> <s> however the policy has not changed since circular / and i should like to quote from paragraph of that circular <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with my noble friend that we must maintain a firm policy <e> <s> the policy is that which i have just stated to

to appeal which have subsequently been granted i am afraid i do not have the figures and i shall have to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> this new clause linked as it is with the desire to delete clauses and strikes as the noble lord lord diamond said at the heart of the governments proposals to introduce spz legislation <e> <s> in other words in opposing the question that those two clauses stand part of the bill the clear intention of the noble lord is to prevent local planning authorities in england wales and scotland from setting up simplified planning zone schemes <e> <s> it is these clauses that insert the essential provisions in the relevant acts of parliament to require authorities to consider the benefits of establishing spzs and to do so i think this important where they decide <e> <s> if these enabling provisions were deleted from the bill the provisions in schedule allowing local authorities to prepare and alter schemes and prescribing procedures for so doing would fall <e> <s> the governments entire spz proposal would effectively be killed off <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> if the noble lord likes to glance at schedule to the bill he will see that there is one occasion only where the secretary of state is involved <e> <s> that is in paragraph <e> <s> that paragraph says quite simply that where a developer feels that a local authority should consider setting up an spz scheme he may make application to the secretary of state <e> <s> that is the only time the secretary of state becomes involved <e> <s> when the noble lord tries to say that we are taking away yet more democracy from a local authority i do not think he can be allowed to get away with it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i cannot accede to the request so reasonably put by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> his scheme in the bill for simplified planning zones is so incredibly flexible that where the local authority want to go into great detail for the corner site in a city or whatever they can make spz schemes to that effect <e> <s> on the other hand where they want to make very much more relaxed schemes the local authority can do so <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to <e>", "<cs> like the noble baroness i am totally sold on efficiency and value for money in local government <e> <s> therefore it is with some regret that i have to say to her that this modest spur to efficiency is not really a runner as concerns spzs <e> <s> i say that for the following reasons <e> <s> i cannot agree that local planning authorities should be tied down to thinking about setting up spzs only when they have a local plan or <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is right <e> <s> this amendment would have the effect of limiting the application of simplified planning zones only to those areas in the country which were in receipt of urban development grant under the inner <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord was speaking i was rapidly looking for the part of the bill where it states in what circumstances already not outlined in the bill the secretary of state would have the power to designate extra areas <e> <s> in fact we shall come to that point under the amendment to be moved by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> in a few moments <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to put myself at the noble lords disposal <e>", "<cs> this very brief amendment which is out of all proportion to the size of its effect would seriously undermine the whole concept of the governments proposals to introduce spzs <e> <s> the amendment if accepted would as the noble baroness has said reduce the specified -year life span of spzs schemes by half to only five years <e> <s> this is the same period as ordinary detailed planning permissions run for <e>", "<cs> yes certainly he could <e> <s> also the application to the secretary of state is only a last-resort power <e> <s> in the first instance the application has to be made to the local planning authority and the local planning authority has to have refused <e> <s> i should have thought that a reasonable planning authority in the circumstances that the noble baroness has just outlined would not refuse but would be only too delighted for the benefit of its residents to try to accommodate the concerns <e>", "<cs> the basis for my remarks was paragraph up to the second or

do not see that that is a bad thing <e>", "<cs> i do not think i should repeat what i said at the beginning of this afternoons proceedings to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i trust that now both he and i know exactly what i meant and that i have been able to spell it out to the committee <e> <s> so far as concerns the substantial point of the noble lord lord foot he will know only too well that central government in the shape of the secretary of state for the environment or the secretary of state for wales have to approve the county structure plan <e> <s> i do not see that it is a particular imposition on democracy that the spz scheme should have some access i suppose that is the word for the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> even in my few weeks in the department i have discovered that the political complexion of various local authorities is regularly taken into account <e> <s> i do not see anything wrong in that <e> <s> the secretary of state would have to know the general philosophy of the local authority in this case the noble baroness looks questioningly when i say that i am sorry <e> <s> he can hardly ignore it can he <e>", "<cs> i appreciate fully that these amendments would not remove the reaction between the local authority and the individual <e> <s> what they would do however is to remove the right of an individual to request the secretary of state to direct a local planning authority to prepare an spz scheme <e> <s> as the bill stands this right would operate only where an individual had put a proposal for an spz to the authority and the authority had either refused to comply with the application or failed to make a decision within three months of receiving the request <e> <s> it would also be the only situation in which the secretary of state could initiate the setting up of spz schemes <e>", "<cs> it was not apparent to me on reading the amendment that the noble baroness sought to give assistance in the form of loan or share capital <e> <s> i am advised that there is a bar in clause to doing this <e> <s> therefore she has tabled the amendment to the wrong clause which is what has confused my advisers <e>", "<cs> i can explain that <e> <s> loan or share capital is not part of it <e> <s> the words that the noble baroness has quoted could include the provision of productive machinery i am sorry i shall start again <e> <s> the second part of clause which is what all this refers to is what i like to think of as a laundry list of types of qualifying activity <e> <s> assistance may be given on expenditure incurred in connection with any of these activities <e> <s> the present list is wide <e> <s> the phrase in connection with means that expenditure on such items as fees and finance charges legitimately incurred would be eligible as well as the cost of materials and works but there is a common theme all items concern expenditure on land or buildings <e>", "<cs> i sought to explain to the committee not that i was automatically rejecting amendments tabled by the opposition but that i though i had good reason to do so <e> <s> my good reason was that the amendment as drafted as i understood from the initial speech of the noble baroness lady david either was in the wrong place or if it meant what i thought it meant was drawn too wide <e> <s> i should have thought that both reasons were perfectly apposite

subject to rapid correction any money that is spent on urban regeneration grant would first be in addition <e>", "<cs> in addition <e> <s> secondly derelict land can occur outside urban areas but urban regeneration grant is kept specifically to within urban areas but that does not necessarily mean the inner cities <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend lord elton in his second reading speech was taking noble lords through the individual provisions of the bill he <e>", "<cs> it certainly is not my normal practice <e> <s> obviously i shall have to look into the point that the noble baroness lady seear has made <e> <s> it may be a printing mistake or it may be something that needs amendment at report <e> <s> as i have said i shall certainly look into the matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend has a personal view about that <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall have to look to see whether it is normal statutory language <e> <s> i rather doubt that it is and if it is not i shall make sure it is put right <e>", "<cs> there is a planning publication in three volumes which i have always been told is referred somewhat inelegantly to as the planning <e>", "<cs> i am totally unable to answer that question <e> <s> what i can tell the noble baroness is that the powers that be in the public bill office and the clerks at the table have been working consistently and very conscientiously to make sure that there will be no delay in printing <e> <s> as far as i know that was the position on tuesday night <e> <s> all the amendments to the bill were already in printers block form by the following morning <e> <s> therefore i do not expect any undue delay <e>", "<cs> i rather thought that the noble baroness in moving this amendment was going to utter a threat that if i resisted this amendment i would do so at my peril if not now certainly at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend and the noble baroness i think know me better than that <e> <s> i have not the least intention of resisting these amendments but i shall have to consider the exact form that would be appropriate because as my noble friend has said this particular wording has been in an act of parliament for years and things change <e>", "<cs> when last month i arrived at the department i discovered that there was growing concern in some quarters about the way that the department adds buildings to the statutory lists <e> <s> from the tone of the small debate that we have had this evening it is quite clear to me that the dust has not yet settled <e> <s> incidentally i must say that it adds a certain <e>", "<cs> yes i was obviously mumbling as i am rather apt to do at the time <e> <s> i can confirm that my officials have spent many weeks of their summer in consultation with the

<e> <s> the rescue archaeology grants to which the noble baroness has referred have nothing to do with listed buildings <e> <s> they may or may not have something to do with ancient monuments but they have nothing to do with any amendments that have as yet been put down <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness will get from the flavour of my reply the answer to her question but not in quite the same form as she might have anticipated <e> <s> before i go into all this i should say that i do not think it is proper to discuss individual cases this evening especially when decisions have not yet been arrived at by my secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am at the end of this quite long debate for a committee stage grateful to all members of the committee who have taken part in the discussion <e> <s> when the right reverend prelate the bishop of london spoke of a compromise i think that it is nothing less than balancing on a tightrope and any one of the three parties namely the churches main committee the church commissioners or indeed the government can knock the others flying at any moment and so his point was very well taken <e>", "<cs> i readily accept that at first sight the amendment has its attractions <e> <s> i note that the proposed new section a and i am grateful to the noble baroness for her correction would apply only to unoccupied or partly occupied property and would thus avoid the worst problems of carrying out works to occupied buildings perhaps someones home against the wishes of the owner <e> <s> nevertheless there are still objections to giving authorities the powers sought <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could be as speedy as the noble baroness on this occasion <e> <s> it might seem strange that at a time when the department is putting so much emphasis on speeding up planning procedures this amendment should be introduced but the present wording of the paragraphs in schedule is causing problems and unnecessary aggravation for applicants authorities and the department <e> <s> all referred applications are dealt with as quickly as possible <e> <s> action is completed on about per cent <e> <s> of cases within the -day period and with the help of english heritage who advise us we hope to improve our performance <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge and belief the situation remains as it is in wales <e> <s> if i am wrong perhaps i may be allowed to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i must confess that the noble baroness has bowled me rather a fast ball which i am totally unable to answer <e> <s> i will if i may write to her <e>", "<cs> before i respond to the two amendments perhaps i may thank my noble friend lord montagu for his answer to the question put by the noble baroness lady white on the previous amendment <e> <s> he was of course right so i do not think that a letter will be required <e> <s> however i shall cogitate on whether a similar procedure in wales would be appropriate <e> <s> on that score i shall certainly write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> at present if a planning authority discriminates racially in reaching a decision on a planning application that decision is likely to be quashed if taken to the courts <e> <s> the racial or ethnic origin of the applicant cannot be a material land use planning consideration but the noble lord lord foot is quite right there is at present no specific remedy in law available to someone who may be discriminated against in the administrative process in the handling of a planning application for example if the consideration of his application is deliberately delayed <e>", "<cs> the amendments of the noble baroness bear a striking resemblance to those tabled in another place <e> <s> while i entirely share the laudable underlying objective of the amendments of conserving the countryside and the landscape i rather like my noble friend who has just spoken am not convinced that extending planning control is the best way to do so <e> <s> perhaps it would be appropriate for me to remind the committee that the section is of course that of a planning bill <e>", "<cs> in that case i can only say horrors <e>", "<cs> i think it is a bit late at night to start an argument with the noble baroness but it is my recollection that most land drainage areas are in what are proposed to be environmentally sensitive areas or other areas covered by conservation controls of one sort of another <e>", "<cs> again at this late hour i have been doing a wee bit of editing of my own and i have two comments to make on this amendment <e> <s> first it is undesirable in planning terms because it relates to matters that will frequently be outside the control of the beneficiary of the planning permission <e> <s> while he can request suppliers of goods and materials and contractors to approach and leave the development site by a specified route he cannot require them to do so <e> <s> such a condition would therefore be unreasonable <e> <s> it would also be unenforceable by local authorities acting under their planning powers <e> <s> enforcement of rights of passage over public highways is a matter for the police and for the local authority acting under highway and traffic regulation powers <e>", "<cs> i rather suspect that this amendment arises from a misunderstanding of provisions in the bill <e> <s> in new section a the bill seeks to reproduce the acts existing provisions for development plan schemes with some updating and clarification <e> <s> the main change is that proposals except those affecting land in a national park to alter repeal or replace a local plan are now to be included in the local plan scheme as well as those for making a local plan and local planning authorities may prepare such proposals only where authorised to do so by the scheme <e> <s> this change has been introduced to keep local plan schemes in step with the times proposals to alter or replace local plans form a more important part of local planning authority work now that many initial plans have been prepared <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> in that case i shall continue <e> <s> new section provides that district planning authorities shall keep under review the need for and adequacy of local plans for their area and may make recommendations to the county planning authority for incorporation into the local plan scheme <e> <s> the county planning authority are to make and amend the local plan scheme in the light of those recommendations and in consultation with the district authorities <e> <s> under the new provisions as with the current ones the secretary of state may amend a local plan scheme in response to representations from a district who are dissatisfied with it <e> <s> i think these provisions safeguard the interests of both districts and counties while presenting the public with a clear programme of the local plans to be prepared in each county <e>", "<cs> i rather anticipate that most of those questions are covered in the noble baronesss amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> would it be convenient if i spoke very quickly to that now <e> <s> the purpose of that amendment appears to be to ensure that ministers do not seek to recover costs from people who are legitimate third party objectors at planning inquiries <e> <s> there is no proposal so to do <e> <s> it is not the intention to recover costs from third parties <e> <s> indeed in the case of abortive inquiries it would not in any case be possible <e>", "<cs> as regards the opening remarks of the noble baroness on the amendment which she felt my noble friend lord bellwin was bullied into making on an earlier occasion i remind her that there is a proverb on the west coast of scotland which goes we think better later <e> <s> that is exactly what the government have done <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows full well we expect to spend million to million over six or seven years on each of the new development corporations <e>", "<cs> since the noble baroness as she admits makes the same point that she made earlier it will not surprise her to get exactly the same answer <e> <s> this abrupt cut-off is a deterrent to developers wishing to invest in an enterprise zone toward the end of the zones life <e> <s> there would be uncertainty as to the planning position of developments begun but incomplete when the area ceases to have enterprise zone status <e> <s> as i said in introducing this amendment we are doing nothing more nor less than your lordships committee has already approved in our addition to the bill for spzs <e>", "<cs> as i began to say on the last amendment before i interrupted myself before regulations are made we shall consult interested parties such as the council on tribunals the law societies and the local authority associations <e> <s> however we do not think it desirable for there to be a requirement to consult <e> <s> i can think of circumstances where that would lead to a waste of time and resources where only a technical amendment was needed <e> <s> the requirement to consult might delay the introduction of a universally accepted change <e> <s> for those reasons i urge the noble baroness to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> i tried to give the assurance that we shall consult on any occasions where there are people to be consulted <e> <s> but there are a couple of occasions which i instanced when it would not be appropriate to consult and therefore we shall not consult <e>", "<cs> my lords none <e>", "<cs> my lords the reduction of the inflation rate to per cent <e> <s> for which the government quite rightly claim credit has had the effect of creating a rise in real incomes in the region to which the noble lord refers in his question namely the south-east <e> <s> with regard to first time buyers these have risen in number every year since according to the building societies figures <e> <s> in there were compared with only in <e> <s> i should have thought that these figures speak for themselves in demonstrating the success of the governments encouragement of home ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mellish the government do not approve of either spivs or cowboys <e> <s> this is obviously a situation which needs watching very carefully <e> <s> but i have not had evidence to suggest that it is happening on a widespread scale <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mellish would like to produce evidence i shall consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the reason why the government are encouraging local authorities to take up the per cent <e> <s> allowance for capital receipts for low-cost home ownership which i think is probably the subject which the noble lord is covering in his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords that surely presupposes that all houses in the south-east are newly built which in fact is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we will not know the figures for until they are published <e> <s> however i can tell the house that in the growth in house prices was per cent in it was per cent in it was per cent in it was per cent and in it was per cent <e> <s> i would accept that these figures are national figures and it is very much more difficult to isolate them to particular regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend that in so far as there is a problem of dwelling accommodation which in fact was not what i was asked in this question then the more units that are made available to rent must obviously help <e> <s> freeing such properties from the scope of the rent acts would be very much a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is for the government to justify the situation <e> <s> as i have revealed during this series of questions this afternoon there are people in the south-east who can and do afford to pay the prices which are asked of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can be expected nor would the house expect me to make an off the cuff comment on a letter that the noble lord has read out <e> <s> however so far as repossession cases are concerned obviously this is a worrying factor but i do not see it as being connected to the question that the noble lord put on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> however the housing corporation is not the only funder of housing associations although it does certainly provide the major slice at the moment <e> <s> there are also local authorities where they choose to use that route to spend their money <e> <s> since the building societies act came into force there is the opportunity for building societies to invest in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have been drawn down a route which is really not germane to the original question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in answer to another supplementary question but referring to the noble lord lord northfield that the figures i gave originally were countrywide <e> <s> from those figures there is no evidence that the situation that the noble lord describes in his supplementary question is putting people off buying houses <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should point out to the noble lord lord dean that it is now a well accepted economic fact that large amounts of spending power released rapidly are inflationary <e> <s> i should point out to him that per cent <e> <s> of billion is billion which the government regard as an acceptable level of non-inflationary allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to go on to complete my sentence <e> <s> perhaps i should point out to the house that this is report stage <e> <s> in when i first became a spokesman for the government the capital receipt allowance was per cent <e> <s> should it have remained at per cent <e> <s> today that would mean that local authorities would be able to spend billion a year of their own receipts <e> <s> there is no doubt in the governments mind that this would be inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this must be the last time that i seek the leave of the house to respond to this amendment <e> <s> this amendment as i sought to point out to the the right reverend prelate has absolutely nothing to do with the total level of housing investment <e> <s> it is about the effect of council house sales upon an authoritys ability to meet its responsibilities <e> <s> the suggestion is that authorities should be reimbursed for sales <e> <s> i would suggest that the house sticks to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mulley for the way that he moved the first amendment and spoke to the second and for giving me the opportunity to try to explain the matters that he has raised <e> <s> i am at one with the noble lord in wishing to ensure that tenants exercising the right to buy are fully informed about the way in which the purchase price quoted to them has been worked out so that they can query anything that looks wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i can readily understand the objective of the noble baroness in tabling this amendment and i have some sympathy with its purpose <e> <s> we are concerned here with houses and flats located within cemeteries or within what i may perhaps be allowed to call operational buildings buildings such as schools which are not there to serve housing purposes <e> <s> as the law stands if a public sector landlord lets a house or flat falling into this category to an employee in consequence of his or her being an employee the tenancy may well be secure but the right to buy does not arise <e> <s> however if the letting is to an ordinary tenant the right to buy will arise unless one of the various exceptions to security of tenure or the right to buy applies <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment the noble lord is seeking to tighten up the consultation provisions in the bill and after the hours or so it seems that we have spent in committee on this subject i am very sorry that he should have seen fit to bring up the matter again <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is absolutely right <e> <s> schedule already sets out in clear and concise terms the consultation arrangements which are to apply when a council wishes to dispose of tenanted dwellings to a private sector landlord <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite have rightly stressed the importance of full and detailed consultation with council tenants about matters affecting their homes <e> <s> we need no reminding of this <e> <s> indeed before the statement we had a division on just this point <e> <s> it has always been this governments policy to ensure as far as possible that such consultations are held <e> <s> that is why we have introduced the new consultation requirements now contained in clauses and of the bill to strengthen further the right of council tenants to be consulted about plans affecting their homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord stallard because he enables me to respond to a point made by his noble friend lord ross of marnock some minutes ago <e> <s> he and his noble friend again expressed concern about paragraph of the new schedule a which provides that a disposal is not invalid if a council has failed to consult its tenants properly <e> <s> i repeat that there is nothing sinister or devious about these provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we ought to be clear what the issue is here <e> <s> we are not talking about tenants losing their homes <e> <s> they will continue to live in the same house but with a different landlord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak with the leave of the house and answer the points of the noble lord lord elystan-morgan my concern is that this is not a properly comparable case for the full panoply of public inquiry and i sought to make this clear to noble lords opposite in committee <e> <s> the amendment has been drafted in part at least with the comments that i made then very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house those were a couple of quick sharp exchanges which i was not expecting especially the one from the noble lord lord davies <e> <s> however i shall respond to him in public on this point as i have already responded to him in private <e> <s> i hate to drive a wedge between the noble lord lord stallard and the noble lord lord graham <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sure i never will but i should point out to both noble lords that the noble lord lord graham at the end of his remarks produced a very good reason for not accepting the amendment which the noble lord lord stallard proposed earlier on postal ballots <e> <s> be that as it may i can assure the noble lord lord graham that when he referred to the case in bethnal green he gave me the impression as i am sure he intended to that it was done without proper consultation and that the tenants in that respect were bounced <e> <s> do i have the right end of the stick <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that extra explanation <e> <s> the whole point of what i have been saying today and in committee is that the bill says firmly that the secretary of state must not only know of the consultation process but must understand how it is being used how it is carried out what information has been given to the tenants and so on <e> <s> the secretary of state if he is not satisfied can direct the council to do it over again <e> <s> he has the ultimate power and he is the ultimate conscience of the consultation process <e> <s> i do not think that this is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the tenancy agreement would be exactly the same whether the landlord went bankrupt or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad the noble baroness finds this amendment light relief <e> <s> i too was somewhat relieved to be able to delve into a dictionary rather than into endless dry and dusty lawbooks which during the course of my researches on this bill have not been allowed to gather any dust principally due to the noble baronesss and her noble friends castigations or perhaps exposure of my knowledge <e> <s> perhaps there is a simpler way of putting that but i am not with it at the moment <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> my lords i always respond to the noble lords amendments <e> <s> he does not always like the response but nonetheless i propose to do so again <e> <s> there are three points here the attempt to list information that must be given to a tenant about a proposal to delegate management the proposed requirement that a majority of tenants positively endorse the proposal and the deletion of the provision about technical invalidity <e>", "<cs> my lords i enjoy watching the noble baroness moving however little motion she makes <e> <s> what the amendments entail is certification by local authorities in every single case where an improved property is to be let on an assured tenancy the formulation of an entirely new property standard just for the purposes of the assured tenancy scheme and a duty on the landlord to maintain the property to that standard throughout the period of the assured tenancy letting <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to speak entirely from memory which is why i did not respond to the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> in particular i do not have a copy of the relevant column of <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the few times that i am delighted the noble baroness continues to bully me <e> <s> when we debated this subject in committee i said that the government were sympathetic to what the amendment was seeking to achieve <e> <s> i undertook to look into the point to see whether we could come back with an amendment of our own at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am genuinely sorry that the noble baroness has chosen to pursue this amendment which as i endeavoured to explain in committee is damaging to the interests both of approved landlords and perhaps more importantly of their tenants <e> <s> under existing law if a landlord loses his approved body status he is prevented from granting any further assured tenancies as i said just now to the noble lord lord dean but any tenancies granted up to the point where approval is withdrawn remain as assured tenancies <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not quite what i said <e> <s> i said that if a landlord loses his approved body status he is prevented from granting any further assured tenancies <e> <s> it would be the most tremendous penalty if we prevented him from letting at all and i am sure that this is not what the noble baroness wants <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that by the time we go to bed tonight i shall have proved to the house that i am no sluggard in considering race relations issues <e> <s> i recognise that this amendment is a valiant effort to meet the points that i made in committee <e> <s> i regret to say though that the amendment illustrates just the problem i referred to then namely the difficulty in amending the present ground in a way that remedies the shortcomings while not making local authority tenants subject to their landlords authority more than is necessary to enable their landlords to carry out their functions properly <e> <s> in my view this is too complicated and sensitive an area of law to amend overnight without proper consultation of all the interested bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not have ground in front of me although the noble lord lord elystan-morgan obviously has <e> <s> the amendment deals with the opposite of what ground seeks to do <e> <s> i was not trying to pull the wool over anyones eyes or anything like that <e> <s> i was making a genuine attempt to show willing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may be allowed to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i think that we are about to start talking at cross purposes at great length <e> <s> the point that i was making is that the subject of ground is the tenant whereas the subject of the new ground proposed under the amendment is anyone but the tenant <e> <s> i hope that i have now explained the matter correctly and that the noble lord will take the point on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until a quarter past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has such a nice way of calling me disingenuous that i always find it flattering <e> <s> in moving this amendment the noble baroness quite rightly said that we debated an amendment in identical terms during the committee stage <e> <s> i am sure that it will not come as a surprise to the house to learn that we have undergone no sea change in our views in the past fortnight <e> <s> our position remains that we would regard as at best premature any attempt to amend the homeless legislation in the light of the law lords judgment in the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house while i agree with per cent <e> <s> of what the noble countess lady mar has just said we have gone <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to report that i had a very helpful meeting with representatives of the new town local authorities last week but i was not surprised in the light of that discussion to see this amendment come forward <e> <s> it is in such similar terms to that moved by the noble baroness lady david in committee that i find it a little difficult to discover something new to say <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to answer the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> we are well aware of the assumed lack of protection for new town housing staff in a case where the housing is not going to a local authority <e> <s> there is clearly an argument that the statutory position for staff should be the same regardless of the destination of the housing they have been managing <e> <s> however i should point out that staffing was not in practice a problem at central lancashire new town where the new town housing was sold last year to four housing associations <e> <s> i think that the staffing implications of future transfers to owners other than councils can be left to be resolved by sensible local negotiation against the background of the employment legislation which applies to the non-housing staff of new town corporations affected by transfers of assets and wind-up <e>", "<cs> of course i anticipate <e> <s> if i need to correspond with the noble baroness further i shall of course do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the origins of section of the landlord and tenant act go back years or more <e> <s> section provides that in any contract for the letting of a house at an annual rent not exceeding a specified amount and subject to certain other conditions there is an implied condition that the house is fit for human habitation at the start of the tenancy and that the landlord will keep it so during the term of the tenancy <e> <s> the present rent limits date from <e> <s> section of the landlord and tenant act dates from <e> <s> it places a statutory obligation on the landlord to keep the dwellinghouse in repair <e> <s> it is a much more exacting requirement than that in section <e> <s> all short leases of property let after in both the public and private sectors have the protection of section and the protection offered by section is not relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that at this time of night we are all becoming rather tired <e> <s> the noble baroness appears to have taken up my last remarks without putting them into the context of the remarks that i made immediately before that <e> <s> i suggest that we both go away and read what we both said <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the noble baronesss amendments are a necessary consequence of the implantation of clause into the bill <e> <s> as such i have no wish to make an issue of either of these amendments but i should stress that does not imply that we accept clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be returning to the noble baronesss determined restriction on the way in which local authorities can manage their stock <e> <s> ground has been in force for a number of years with no evidence of abuse and with no moves to change it <e> <s> no attempt was made in drafting ground to restrict the use to be made of properties after work has been carried out on them because it was envisaged that ground would cover a variety of situations <e> <s> it is for the local authority as landlord to judge in each particular case how best to use its redeveloped stock <e> <s> for example i think it quite likely that from time to time a landlord will wish to carry out work which falls under paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope from what i said in committee that it is clear to the house that the government are not persuaded to find a way of restricting the application of the spz provisions beyond what is already in the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness mentioned environmentally sensitive areas <e> <s> we have an amendment to cover that point in just a few minutes and so i shall reserve my comments until that moment in view of the lateness of the hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be the first to agree with the noble baroness that we need to make sure as far as we are able that there are no loopholes which would undermine our objective of preventing spzs from being set up in inappropriate areas <e> <s> these include national parks areas of outstanding natural beauty green belts conservation areas national scenic areas and of course sites of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the noble baronesss efforts i am afraid that i cannot see that this is an advance on her previous proposals <e> <s> i am sure that in drafting these amendments she had the intention of trying to ensure that no worthwhile request from an applicant would be dismissed summarily by a local authority <e> <s> under the amendment the authority would be forced to take a second look <e> <s> but i cannot see how that will help matters <e> <s> what is needed is in medical parlance a second opinion and that is what the secretary of state will provide with his reserve powers <e> <s> in the unlikely event of a direction being discharged the intervention of the secretary of state to make or alter a scheme himself will be more fruitful than an attempt to enforce the direction by an order for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i assumed that the grouping at the beginning of the afternoon was being kept to <e> <s> i was obviously wrong <e> <s> i thought that the noble baroness was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in that case i have covered amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if any noble lord wishes to move it he will receive a silent response from me <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of part iii of the bill is to provide a flexible enabling power rather than to lay down in precise detail how assistance under clause is to be given <e> <s> thus this part indicates the purposes for which assistance may be given the types of expenditure which qualify for assistance and the form that assistance may take <e> <s> it does not seek to lay down the detailed administrative rules under which payments may be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess i lost my ability to be surprised some hours ago <e> <s> i observed in committee that the following clause now clause ruled out the classic method of doing this the purchase of share or loan capital <e> <s> i accept the point made in that debate by the noble baroness that such finance could in theory be provided either by grants or loans both of which are allowed by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to have lost my notes on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am desperately trying to look at the marshalled list or in my notes for the main government amendment in this block <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i can do no better than quote from the amendment which refers in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble baroness has taken account of some of the points i made at committee stage and that the clause has been substantially revised <e> <s> i thank her for that <e> <s> i note that the scope of the powers sought has been restricted to listed buildings <e> <s> i accept that the fact that the notice would have to be confirmed by the county court before the works could be carried out by the authority or secretary of state does give more protection to the owner <e> <s> however at the risk of repeating what i said in committee the effect of the clauses will be to impose a potential liability on owners of listed buildings of all kinds to carry out works for the preservation of their buildings if the authority and the courts so require <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm straight away that the right reverend prelate has it absolutely spot on <e> <s> however i am sure that all the right reverend prelates were as disappointed as i was to hear the noble lord explaining his reasons for the amendment and illustrating his profound mistrust of the churchs motives when it comes to the care of its listed buildings <e> <s> of course there are times when it is very tempting for the owner of any building not only a church to think how much money can be made by selling the site <e> <s> many churches of all denominations have great difficulty in finding the money for repairs but most of them are remarkably successful in raising funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends for putting down these amendments <e> <s> they cover matters that were touched on in committee and which i undertook to consider in some depth <e> <s> i must add that i have also spoken to my right honourable friend the secretary of state about them on no less than three occasions <e> <s> i am glad therefore to be able to report back on my researches into the difficult subject of how we should control the adaptation and demolition of our finest buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords the ink is scarcely dry on the non-statutory agreement which i announced both at committee and earlier this evening or was it yesterday <e> <s> i am not quite sure <e> <s> i do not think it is right that i should break it unilaterally at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble baroness has tabled this amendment especially as she says that she has been advised by the cpre <e> <s> what she seeks to do is repeal part of existing law which the bill merely restates namely the power for the secretary of state to direct a local planning authority to make alterations repeal or replace local plans for its area or part of it <e> <s> this is not a new power <e> <s> the provisions in the bill carry forward similar provisions in present legislation which were introduced in the act when local plans were first introduced <e> <s> indeed there was a similar provision for development plans before that <e>", "<cs> my lords although this amendment arose from a grammatical defect in section of the town and country planning act the fact is that changes of use of buildings and land where both the existing and the proposed uses fall within the same class of the use classes order is already allowed <e> <s> we have considered carefully the representations of those responding to our consultation paper on the use classes order <e>", "<cs> my lords the present power of direction enjoyed by highway authorities allows the views of one interested party to prevail and denies the local planning authority its role as arbiter between different interested groups <e> <s> its existence assumes that in the last resort the subject matter of the direction is something which the local planning authority cannot decide <e> <s> they thus have a power of veto over the local planning authority <e> <s> naturally as far as highway matters are concerned we recognise the special contribution that highway authorities have made to the planning system <e> <s> over the years however the competence of local planning authorities has increased to an extent where they now have the expertise necessary to take decisions on highway matters in respect of classified roads if they have first taken the views of highway authorities <e> <s> there is now no reason why those views need to be binding on the local planning authorities <e> <s> i do not make those remarks nor does the bill propose this relaxation in a vacuum <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that applications will be made to the london borough of lambeth in respect of all the buildings to establish office use and in respect of the main building for a change to hotel residential and office uses together with ancillary and conference facilities <e> <s> on my noble friends point about ilea not being a member of ilea i find it rather difficult to speak for it <e> <s> however i can tell the house that the london residuary body will be pleased to enter into negotiations with ilea on its future housing and i can confirm that its notice to quit expires on st march <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we debated that very subject month after month in your lordships house last year <e> <s> no i do not think that that would be a good idea <e> <s> the point is that the buildings future is a matter for the london residuary body which of course owns it as a result of an act of parliament <e> <s> it is up to the lrb to decide how and in what way to investigate its future use <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my safest answer to my noble friend is to say that that is a point of view with which i do not disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very hypothetical indeed but i did tell the house that there will not be vacant possession until at least march <e>", "<cs> my lords the major part of county hall that is to say the front and the main building is a listed building so that any change or any alteration to the inside of the building would need listed building consent again from lambeth council <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness somewhat misinterpreted what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not intended to be a funny remark when i said to my noble friend lord maude that i did not disagree <e> <s> however equally as a distinguished lawyer the noble lord lord mishcon will know that that cannot under any circumstances be construed as saying that i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should be unwise to comment further on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that was not the case we were considering <e> <s> when we reach the point that the noble lord lord dean proposes in amendment no <e> <s> unless he wants to deal with the point now which i am prepared to do we can consider the workings of schedule <e> <s> this amendment is directed to those cases where the noble baroness lady david wishes to insert into the statute a public local inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that that was an intervention and that i need not ask the leave of the house to speak again <e> <s> with regard to the point made by the noble lord lord stallard the consultation provisions in clause relate to sales of tenanted properties to any private sector purchaser <e> <s> in such a case tenants will have the preserved right to buy security of tenure and such other rights as are protected by agreement with the developer <e> <s> the question of on-sale by the developer of tenanted properties is irrelevant <e> <s> tenants will retain their rights including security of tenure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but this amendment would achieve the very opposite of what the noble baroness has said she would like to see in the bill <e> <s> clause as it now stands enables a local authority to apply to the rent officer for certificates of fair rent in respect of residential properties of which they intend to dispose <e> <s> we envisage that they will mainly make use of it where they are disposing of tenanted property to another landlord who will then go on letting it under a regulated tenancy on a registered fair rent in other words exactly the circumstances that the noble baroness quoted from my letter to her of th october <e>", "<cs> my lords although this is the first time that these particular amendments have been proposed this subject has been raised on several occasions in our discussions on the bill <e> <s> we have therefore as the noble lord lord dean said covered this ground before and i am well aware of the suspicion with which paragraph of schedule and new section a which is inserted by clause are viewed by some of the noble lords opposite <e> <s> but as i have said before there is nothing devious about these provisions <e>", "<cs> again my lords i am afraid that this amendment would do no practical good <e> <s>

friend lord boyd-carpenter for his comments on what the noble baroness said as regards devaluing the north <e> <s> part iii of the bill does exactly the opposite <e> <s> its purpose is to give my right honourable friend a comprehensive power to provide assistanc for the regeneration of the physical fabric of run-down urban areas wherever they might occur in the country <e> <s> it was not

right <e> <s> there is also the fact which has nothing to do with the government that more and more people are now driving diesel cars which of course are lead-free <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am very grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> i did not add that a staggering kilograms per person are emitted from east germany every year <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will remember that at the very beginning of the committee stage your lordships and i speaking for the government even before the matter came to a division agreed that the test of whether houses and flats really were suitable for the elderly and so exempt from the right to buy had not worked well in practice <e> <s> although i said that the government were themselves working towards a simpler and more objective statutory test the noble baroness lady david assisted by the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble lord lord hylton put down an amendment on the marshalled list which in many respects reflected the governments own view very closely indeed <e> <s> i shall get to that in a minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord hughes is absolutely right and i shall refrain from so doing <e> <s> it is true that the opposition spokesman and this is not a quotation went on to say that if tenants felt that they were being unreasonably denied the right to buy by their landlords they could have recourse to the courts <e> <s> however as my honourable friend made clear yesterday that is not a convincing point <e> <s> tenants and landlords already have recourse to the courts against unreasonable decisions by the secretary of state <e> <s> it is quite misleading to suggest that from this point of view the rights of tenants would be strengthened by putting decisions in the hands of the local authorities <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords there is something this afternoon that we can agree on <e> <s> there is already a power in section of the housing act for right-to-buy questions to be decided in the county court <e> <s> this is not the same as judicial review but it might give a tenant another route to the courts under the opposition amendment <e> <s> this does not alter the basic point that decisions of the secretary of state are reviewable and tenants do not find it easy to go even as far as the county court a point that your lordships might well take on board <e>", "<cs> my lords also of course the right to buy releases considerable assets for the local authority so i would suggest to the noble lord lord henderson and i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for reminding me of the point that the noble lord on the cross-benches made that there is even in this case a balance to be struck <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to your lordships amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment concerns a theme that has been running through the operation of the leasehold reform act ever since when my noble friend lord coleraine asked my noble friend lord bellwin speaking from this box whether something could be done about the two methods of assessment for leasehold enfranchisement in the higher rateable value bracket <e> <s> my noble friend replied that until the matter was tested in the courts there was nothing that the government could do about it <e> <s> it was tested in the now famous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for their reaction to this government amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that there is national interest in this subject was given point to first by the noble lords question and secondly by a question of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter the other day <e> <s> it is government policy which was clearly stated during consideration of the abolition bill that all the assets and debts of the metropolitan counties including greater london would go to the various residuary bodies and that it would be for the various residuary bodies to determine what to do with them <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that was a perfectly normal english word <e> <s> yes <e> <s> i do mean selling <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hoped i had made clear in my original answer what happens in the interim is a matter for the residuary body <e> <s> if the south bank board or anyone else is interested in obtaining rehearsal or any other facilities in county hall they should express their interest to the london residuary body in whom county hall is now vested <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that slur on chairmen of residuary bodies in other parts of the country <e> <s> if the noble lord can substantiate what he says <e> <s> i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time your lordships have put me in a quandary should i deliver a speech answer noble lords questions or do a bit of both <e> <s> fortune favours the brave so i shall attempt to tread the middle path <e> <s> we have had a wide-ranging debate and inevitably i can cover only a few of the original points raised <e> <s> some of the points were not so original but i shall leave that <e> <s> i shall have to resort to writing to many noble lords <e>", "<cs> four years <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that there was overwhelming objection <e> <s> i agree that there was a balanced response <e> <s> it is not the first time that governments have legislated on the subject of balanced responses <e> <s> it is not the moment to debate the subject of dog licences with noble lords but that is a case in point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to debate this matter with the noble lord when we get the bill in your lordships house but there are many methods of deciding how and wish what relevance local authorities perform <e> <s> there is the government the district auditor and in certain circumstances as the noble lord will know there are the courts <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> the noble baroness lady burton is a formidable force on the subject of consumer affairs <e> <s> i do not think it would be right in a debate such as this to debate with her the difference between this and consumer protection <e> <s> however i can tell her that we intend to make regulations under part iii of the consumer protection bill to require landlords who resell gas and electricity to give itemised bills to their tenants stating the number of units consumed and the statutory maximum price <e> <s> these regulations will be made as soon as possible after the bill receives royal assent <e> <s> i expect to have the continued support of the noble baroness on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords most cars on the road today which run on regular leaded petrol can also run on unleaded petrol but most cars which run on premium petrol cannot use unleaded petrol <e> <s> those cars will give rise to a significant though declining demand for leaded petrol for a number of years <e> <s> leaded petrol will obviously remain available on forecourts while there is a demand for it <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the noble baronesss first question is no i shall not consult my right honourable friend because he has already made up his mind <e> <s> in his budget speech this year he announced that he intends to create a tax differential in favour of unleaded petrol to offset the higher production costs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i agree with the noble lord lord winstanley that we are dragging our feet in comparison with our european competitors <e> <s> a vital component in all this is the car manufacturers themselves and the ability to produce engines that run on lead-free petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us what your lordships select committee said on this particular point <e> <s> however catalysts have their own disposal problems and produce some pretty horrible wastes <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the figures which i announced in my original answer prove absolutely that the government are not hanging about in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to suggest or to prejudge anything that my right honourable friend may or may not say in the future <e> <s> i have told the noble baroness what he has said in the past <e> <s> as regards advice to motorists and those purchasing new cars new cars coming on stream do not need leaded petrol and therefore in a sense it would be automatic advice <e> <s> however i think i am right in saying that the department of transport has produced a list which shows exactly which cars on the roads today will run on which sort of petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is publicised but if it is not i shall make sure that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that the department consulted very widely on this matter and all views have been taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recall the occasion in the house to which the noble lord lord graham has just referred <e> <s> in accordance with previous practice both houses will be informed of the terms of any new agreements when they have been made <e> <s> on the question of a statutory or a voluntary ban we have always had a voluntary ban up to now and the latest figures

<e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am totally mystified <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the noble lord has presented a correct record as to what happened on that occasion <e> <s> i do not know whether or not discussions took place through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot intervene or follow up the noble earls suggestion of a government inspector because i have no powers so to do <e> <s> the law however provides two remedies <e> <s> the first is the courts which i accept are costly and may not be appropriate in this case i hope that i do not receive a furious reaction from noble and learned lords or secondly through the local ombudsman <e> <s> i understand that that case has already been referred to the ombudsman <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble baroness and the noble earl on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be profitable to rehash the arguments we had at that time on the housing and planning bill <e> <s> the point is that whatever form of consultations one has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i should not wag my finger at the noble earl <e> <s> i am not talking about the case to which he referred but it would be inappropriate for the minority to have a veto <e>", "<cs> my lords the development commissions and cosiras various schemes make a major contribution to the provision of permanent jobs in rural areas through the construction of advance factories offering advice and assistance to small <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am afraid i cannot say because it depends on the development of the agricultural industry within the next months to two years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware not only of the highlands and islands development board but also of the development board for rural wales which are both doing extremely good work in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords all the schemes in action for jobs that is to say schemes with the exception of jobs search travel to interview scheme and career development loan scheme are applicable to rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i must confess that like my noble friend i am a great fan of the development commission <e> <s> that is why as i said in my original answer its budget has been increased by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering the question on behalf of the government <e> <s> the fact that my noble friend the secretary of state for employment happens to be sitting beside me is neither here nor there <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments policy

important matter and it is peoples concerns which count <e> <s> i think it would be helpful therefore if i gave some background to the house <e> <s> i do not want to quibble with the noble lord lord harris but in september the property services agency on behalf of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence proposed the construction of a training complex comprising about buildings on salisbury plain suitable for fighting in built-up areas the so-called fibua complex <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect i think that the noble lord is confusing two different things <e> <s> i have already alluded to the two meetings for local people which are to be held on tuesday and friday next week th and th december <e>", "<cs> my lords if as was suggested i think by the noble lord lord harris the people in question live in the village or indeed have what one might call a civilian interest in this matter of course they will be fully entitled to attend those meetings and to ask questions and receive such replies as appear to be appropriate to the various individuals at that time <e> <s> the noble baroness looks restless <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to explain earlier there are proper procedures for public inquiries or for the consideration of public inquiries in a matter such as this <e> <s> i have assured the house and given your lordships my own assurance that these procedures have been conducted fairly <e> <s> i have said that public relations need to continue and through the meetings to which i have referred they will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a supplementary question from the noble lord lord stallard on th july i said that the first marine nature reserve would be announced and confirmed by the end of november and it has been <e> <s> further sites are being processed by the nature conservancy council which is currently discussing the setting up of further marine nature reserves and those at skomer and the menai straits are well advanced <e> <s> i hope that at least one of them will be designated in <e> <s> survey work and preliminary discussions are continuing at four other sites loch sween st abbs bardsey and scilly islands <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the by-laws are confined to metres of low watermark <e> <s> i do not see any difficulty with the by-law to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> i am grateful for her expression of approval <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware that the charity referred to by my noble friend is the landmark trust <e> <s> the nature conservancy council by-laws will control dumping as well as damage to plants and animals <e> <s> inevitably in such a case some cost will fall on the trust but i am assured that full discussion took place over this long period the noble baroness lady nicol mentioned five years between the trust and the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> the noble lord not for the first time has stumped me <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest comprehensive figures on rent arrears owed to local authorities suggest that accumulated arrears in great britain total over million <e> <s> the authorities with the poorest performances with arrears expressed as a proportion of their annual rent rolls are the london boroughs of brent haringey southwark and lambeth and the western isles district council <e>", "<cs> my lords the current levels of arrears in a minority of authorities are quite scandalous <e> <s> in haringey for example to which my noble friend referred the total arrears run at per cent <e> <s> of total rent income at a smidgen under million <e> <s> they are one of the minority who place an unjustifiable burden on other tenants and on ratepayers who have to bear the costs of interest charges and of ultimately writing off debt <e> <s> it is very hard to see how such authorities justify such disgraceful conduct to their electors and their auditors <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that this problem would not be nearly so serious if the local authorities concerned had proper management controls and identified the problem early <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a whole realm of figures here <e> <s> perhaps on the precise figure it would be appropriate for me to write to the noble lord <e> <s> however the western isles are indeed in the top five authorities concerned and i trust that the electors will take notice of that fact <e>", "<cs> no my lords they are not written off in the first instance <e> <s> there are discussions between the council officials and the individual tenants <e> <s> once they have been identified which as i said to the noble lord lord mellish is the major <e>", "<cs> my lords rent is a current account income and affects repairs and maintenance rather than capital spending <e>", "<cs> my lords if proper management entails very great difficulty perhaps local authorities are not the right people to manage public housing in this country <e> <s> on the original supplementary question of the noble lord lord graham rate support grant has absolutely nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords in severe cases yes indeed <e> <s> it might well do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt an expert on the western isles and i am not <e> <s> however i can tell him that rent arrears as a percentage of rent collectable in the western isles is per cent <e> <s> which i suggest is a high figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no better than to refer the noble lord to the answer i gave to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the position rent being paid direct to the landlord has to be with the agreement of the receiver of the benefit concerned <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord about the precise proportion of the various london boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords that is also my understanding <e> <s> however the question is specifically on local authority rent arrears and it is that question which i came prepared to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords cipfa and the local authority associations are discussing this matter at the moment <e> <s> however the figures given in the press release referred to by the noble baroness and the figures which i have given come from the local authorities themselves <e> <s> if they are incorrect it is the local authorities figures which are wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords they are the same questions as have been asked for a number of years <e> <s> we are looking at a moving picture and the situation has become very much worse in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment about the calculation of expenditure for rate support grant purposes <e> <s> do i assume that i have the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am perfectly prepared not to repeat the statement <e> <s> i am totally in the hands of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are now in a position to have the statement <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the two noble baronesses clearly no one can be pleased that there is a further need to legislate in this highly complex and technical area <e> <s> i am sure the house will agree however that once the government had been advised that the basis on which they had operated was incorrect in law it would have been quite improper to continue without putting matters right <e> <s> i should make the point that the existing system although we are advised that it is incorrect in law was adopted to meet the wishes of local government itself <e> <s> this legislation is therefore validatory and will enable the existing system to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows as well as i do that the only way that the house and the country can be per cent <e> <s> certain of any piece of legislation whether it is in the rates field or any other is when it has been tested in the courts and in some cases has reached ultimately what i might refer to as the judicial arm of your lordships house <e> <s> but what i can tell the noble lord is that there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he trained me well when i was aiding and supporting him and he taught me as it were to know myself <e> <s> since then my theory has been that if i cannot understand a matter i cannot possibly help your lordships understand it <e> <s> that reminds me to answer a question of the noble baroness lady stedman which was what expenditure we are talking about <e> <s> relevant expenditure is the amount met by rates block grant and specific and supplementary grants and any use of reserves <e> <s> total expenditure is the amount met by rates and block grant and any use of the reserves <e> <s> i hope that that helps her <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained earlier the rate support grant proposals are announced by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> it is perfectly true that there were two statements this year which i also referred to earlier <e> <s> the statement in july was the original proposal since then as i explained new information came to my right honourable friend and he made another statement in december <e> <s> as i have said the confirmation once consultation has again taken place will be made in january <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing <e> <s> but i have already explained to the house that my right honourable friend considered it wrong at that point to come to the house until he had clear proposals for tackling the problem <e> <s> that was my right honourable friends decision <e>", "<cs> my lords because total expenditure is relevant to the calculations on rate and precept limitation and the bill is likely still to be going through parliament we cannot operate the normal rates act timetable <e> <s> new rate and precept limitation procedures for only will be included in the bill as a temporary phenomenon <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the controller was talking about a report in draft and no one knows what the final report will look like <e> <s> nevertheless i agree with the noble lord that the controller issued a timely warning as a result of the current considerations of the audit commission <e> <s> as to what will happen that is a hypothetical question <e> <s> if local authorities sort themselves out the situation will not arise <e> <s> like the noble lord i note that if the labour party were to form a government the opposition have made it quite clear that they have no intention of picking up the tab <e>", "<cs> my lords in a nutshell that conduct refers to creative accounting on the capital control accounts of the various local authorities in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of what was said <e> <s> however since a quarter of publicly-raised finance is spent by local authorities any large increases are by definition inflationary <e> <s> so the government need to control expenditure anyway <e> <s> it is disgraceful that some irresponsible authorities almost all of them controlled by left-wing councils manipulate the system to run up huge debts which will eventually have to be met by the ratepayer <e> <s> this must clearly be condemned <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not given the impression to my noble friend or to anyone else that i am not taking this matter extremely seriously <e> <s> as far as the opacity of the phrase creative accounting is concerned i refer to two comments in my original answer <e> <s> the great difficulty is that until <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble lord correctly i do not think that it is up to me to defend what a previous labour minister has said <e> <s> however in reply to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i was referring to any large increases whether in local authorities or through the public exchequer being inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a very technical second question on which i shall have to write to him <e> <s> however he knows as well as i do that large amounts of money swilling around the system cause inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope no one in your lordships house will think me patronising when i start the governments response to the bill put forward by the noble earl lord halsbury by saying that he brings great credit to this house by bringing before us a most important subject which is much in the public mind at the moment <e> <s> it is extremely disturbing to see some of the material which is <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend my original answer concealed the fact that we are currently monitoring the quality of more than bathing waters according to the regime laid down by the commission in the directive <e> <s> further-more we are in discussion with the water industry with a view to designating further waters <e> <s> it is hoped to do that shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure was and remains <e> <s> the directive however does not set out guidance and we are in discussion with the commission as to precisely what the directive means for the selection of bathing waters <e> <s> up to now the government have selected them on bathing use rather than on the use of an adjacent beach which i understand has been the practice in some other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the moral pressure that is required is not on local authorities but on the water authorities in whose domain these waters fall <e> <s> moral pressure is being applied <e> <s> the house will know that some million is being spent over the next four years by the water authorities on capital projects to improve the water quality and this will continue beyond <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the supplementary question of the noble lord the leader of the opposition it may be that i slightly misunderstood the question from my noble friend behind me <e> <s> the problem of litter on beaches is one for local authorities whereas the quality of the water <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends point on the inheritance of the water authorities from the local authorities is well made <e> <s> nobody pretends that this problem which undoubtedly occurs in some places will be cleared up overnight <e> <s> the million over the next four years which will continue beyond is within the water authorities investment plans approved by government most recently in another place on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords from the list of monitoring which was given by my honourable friend the member for leeds north-west on th december it appears at first glance that some per cent <e> <s> of the waters would meet the requirements of the directive <e> <s> over the next years i would expect pretty well all the waters in question to be brought to an acceptable standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble baronesses for their rather cool reception of this statement which as both have noted is the fourth we have had on this subject since the end of october <e> <s> i think it would be fair to point out that the intentions of my right honourable friend were strictly honourable and the first statement was indeed considerably earlier than it has been in any previous year <e> <s> the fact that new information came in made the statement of rd december necessary <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think i can accept that <e> <s> what my right honourable friend did as the chairman of hertfordshire county council made clear in early december was listen to the views of local authorities and local authority associations which of course the act fully expected him to do <e> <s> that is why it contained proposals for him so to do <e> <s> the local government finance bill had its second reading in another place yesterday and we will get on to it in due course <e> <s> i have no doubt that your lordships will have a certain amount to say on it then <e> <s> however i just make the point that i made in a statement shortly before we rose for the christmas recess <e> <s> the whole objective of that bill is to validate the <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his support of the abolition of grant recycling <e> <s> yes quite clearly it is an absolute nonsense if on the one hand a particular local authority can <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will make available substantially more provision and grant for a settlement on teachers pay which meets our requirements on pay structure and duties whenever that may occur <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for educations announcement of th october said that million grant in respect of million expenditure would be available for <e> <s> for the respective figures were million grant and million provision <e> <s> the house will therefore see clearly that it is expected that this current settlement will mean a substantial increase in funding <e>", "<cs> my lords at a quick glance at the noble lords question i am not aware of any additional expenditure due to the passing of that act <e> <s> however i shall have clearly to look into this further and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i am aware such severe weather payments to which i think the noble lord is referring are paid for from the centre and not through the grant entitlement <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for social security has just announced in another place that for this week only the payments will be made to all in the qualifying groups that is those over years old or families with a child or children under two years <e> <s> this is not dependent on what happens to the weather this week <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will know that the green paper proposes and i use the noble lords word to make the grant system much simpler <e> <s> once the proposed reforms are implemented the new system will ensure that every pound increase in spending means a increase in local domestic taxation <e> <s> grant entitlements will no longer depend on spending whether of that authority or any other <e> <s> however i take the point that primary legislation will be needed for this and there will be no doubt an enormous amount of discussion in both houses and indeed outside them before such an act can reach the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can do is to confirm that what are in the green paper are proposals and proposals they will remain until they get on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that if any of that money goes to the treasury it will be the local authoritys own fault <e> <s> if local authorities spend at the generous level provided by the government they can claim the full amount of grant <e> <s> this is what i would hope they would find themselves able to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement which i have just read out is not the rate support grant report for it is a statement of my right honourable friends firm intentions <e> <s> one of the points in the bill is that my right honourable friend should not be allowed to take any further considerations into account after i think th december <e> <s> it may well be that there will be considerable discussion on this point both in another place and in your lordships house <e> <s> however the auguries if i may put it like that make the intentions in the statement as positive as they currently can be <e>", "<cs> it is my lords in my right honourable friends own words his firm intentions yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble earls view that this matter is of great public interest <e> <s> many bodies are involved in this problem and they will find that they have conflicting interests <e> <s> i should expect major contributions from the council of british archaeology the museums and galleries commission the museums association and english heritage and from several different government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should expect the review to discover anomalies in the present arrangements and it is those that we have sought to investigate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that that is a widespread view <e> <s> but of course the ancient monuments and archaeological areas act makes it an offence to use a metal detector on scheduled monument sites or areas of archaeological importance without the secretary of states consent <e> <s> reputable operators of metal detectors are well aware of that but i accept that there are others who are not so well informed <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was being briefed on the noble earls question i was also advised by the treasury <e> <s> i hope that that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords god your lordships and the electorate willing i hope to be doing it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge and belief they do not have to have licences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the bill on this subject promoted in by the noble lord lord abinger <e> <s> that of course will be one of the starting points for the review <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and i understand also on beaches <e>", "<cs> my lords the charging of fees for planning applications has been the law of the land since <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord lord stallard says that there was no general welcome in <e> <s> but since with the operation of the scheme there has been no general consternation at it either <e> <s> therefore i suggest that the principle of the fee scheme is past history <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey shows that although there has been a deterioration in a few areas such as the south-west and the north-west there have been improvements in others such as wessex and anglia <e> <s> the overall quality of those waters continues to be high with per cent <e> <s> of river and canal lengths and per cent <e> <s> of estuarial lengths assessed as being of good and fair quality <e> <s> i am well aware that improvements in water quality were attributed in the main to investment by the water authorities and equally by industry <e> <s> deteriorations were attributed to deteriorating sewerage work effluence sometimes due to increased loads and to agricultural pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point about the directive to which the noble baroness referred that is a slightly different subject though i take the point on board and will respond to her in writing <e> <s> following normal practice i shall put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords it was that to which i referred <e> <s> that is what i call the methodology <e> <s> if i confused the noble baroness by my answer i can only apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend knows very well the financing of water authorities is based on a charge for a service or rather a product rendered <e> <s> it is quite right that within the overall water cycle the charges should reflect the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords in a period of very severe weather such as we have experienced particularly but not totally within the south-east of england over recent weeks inevitably there will be burst pipes and as a result much water will go to waste <e> <s> that is a major problem <e> <s> i am informed that the thames water authority is rapidly getting on top of the water shortage problem <e>", "<cs> my lords un general assembly resolution / designated as the international year of shelter for the homeless particularly in the developing countries <e> <s> thus we expect a greater proportion of our bilateral aid will be taken up by homelessness projects <e>", "<cs> my lords there have always been people who need to be housed by local authorities <e> <s> in the period mentioned by the noble lord there have been profound social changes more divorces more illegitimate births more young people leaving home earlier and with enhanced expectations about accommodation <e> <s> on the other hand it is only fair to point out that the homeless households <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so then according to the theory presented by the noble lord lord dean of beswick it will not of itself mean a decrease in the numbers of homeless families <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord on his new position <e> <s> i agree with him as i and my noble friends have made clear from this box on many occasions that houses in multiple occupation and i assume that the noble lord is talking about hotels should be used in absolutely last resort circumstances <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we should continue to encourage local authorities to make the best use of their stock <e> <s> too many empty local authority properties exist currently of which have been empty for more than a year <e> <s> it is even worse in london where there are vacant of which have been empty for more than a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is a financial problem <e> <s> some time ago when we were discussing this matter we heard from my noble friend lady macleod about local authority properties in london which were fit for habitation but which were not being let <e> <s> that must be a scandal in any sense of the word <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord speaks as he usually does when he addresses your lordships house with very great force and with very useful ideas <e> <s> but i do not think that it would be appropriate for government to use legislative powers in this way to force local authorities to do that which the noble lord currently suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> an extra million has been found for per cent <e> <s> housing action grant for private finance schemes which are directed at the homeless <e> <s> also within the urban programme almost million has been found for renovative and wide-ranging housing schemes <e> <s> advice to local authorities via circulars on empty properties and houses in multiple occupation is constantly on the boil <e> <s> the estates action initiatives have been extremely successful but i fully recognise that there is more to do in all these respects <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems about a sudden massive increase in the building or repairs programme are that industry needs time to produce those very materials to which the noble lord has just referred <e> <s> in the meantime the only available source of supply would be from imports <e>", "<cs> my lords in this country there has always been a restriction in the amount of money that local authorities were able to release from their capital receipts certainly since i took an interest and under the last labour government <e> <s> the fact that their capital receipts overall are not so much higher than they were necessitated a reduction from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords the london brick company has had a monopoly of the supply of common fletton bricks since <e> <s> however flettons have faced increasing competition from concrete concrete blocks plasterboard and timber frames and by now command only a small proportion of the total market <e>", "<cs> my lords common fletton bricks are traditionally used more in the private sector than in the public housing sector <e> <s> it is encouraging to see that the governments policies are having a successful effect on building in the private sector which is up by per cent <e> <s> in the period to in comparison with the period to <e> <s> it is important to note that the strength of this growth has not been handicapped by a shortage of building materials <e>", "<cs> my lords the director general of fair trading considered this subject in and recommended to my right honourable friend the then secretary of state for trade that there were no grounds for reference to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> if any noble lord or indeed anybody else considers that the present case warrants investigation he should submit his evidence to the director general for consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord might be interested to know that in million commons were sold <e> <s> by sales had dropped to million <e> <s> in other words this is a phenomenon which has been going on for a considerable time as i said in my original answer because of an increase in the use of alternative materials such as concrete blocks <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that robin hoods bay is the most popular resort in the north yorkshire moors national park and that the local economy depends heavily on tourism <e> <s> i also understand that subsequent to the consultation about which the noble lord has just spoken the revised scheme revised to take account of comments made during the consultation was approved by the national park the borough council the parish council and the local amenities society <e> <s> i think that all concerned have behaved in an exemplary fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords my answers to the noble lord are yes yes and yes <e> <s> i am pleased that he has backed up my last supplementary answer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of these facts <e> <s> indeed i can tell the house that the councillors of fylingdales parish council have written to the scarborough borough council expressing dismay about the way that the views of the residents and ratepayers association objecting to the scheme have been represented in the press as the views of the whole community <e>", "<cs> my lords when i am asked a question of this sort in your lordships house i review all the available papers on the particular case <e> <s> i therefore looked at this case with great care knowing that i would be answering a question today from the noble lord <e> <s> as i have said my conclusion is that the authorities in question have behaved in an exemplary fashion <e> <s> they have taken account of the consultation procedure and they have changed their plans <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case they are also interested in cliffs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest of the noble lord lord hunt in this matter which as he said has surfaced on two previous occasions in parliamentary questions <e> <s> i accept straightaway that it has dragged on far too long which is why my right honourable friend through my mouth as it were has made the announcement that he has today <e> <s> i suspect that there are lessons to be learnt from this <e> <s> when we have concluded this we shall be able to make an analysis of what lessons are to be drawn and what action we can take in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that far too much limestone had been quarried <e> <s> i was careful not to say that <e> <s> what i said and the noble baroness is quite right was that this matter has dragged on far too long <e> <s> yes the decision that my right honourable friend is minded to make is indeed for tonnes a year <e> <s> but as i said he will make up his mind when he finally makes the decision on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been suggested that a working party on chemically pure limestone should be set up and this matter remains under consideration <e> <s> we need to know the extent of high purity high quality limestone in this country but i rather suspect that by the nature of things this is likely to be in areas which will give rise to the same sort of public concern that this one has in other words high landscape value areas <e>", "<cs> my lords not to the best of my knowledge but high quality or chemically pure limestone is comparatively scarce and is important in the manufacture of chemicals pharmaceuticals and magnesia refractories <e> <s> for most of those applications the limestone must be at least per cent <e> <s> calcium carbonate and have a very low concentration of impurities such as iron and aluminium <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering the question today and the letter was sent today as i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather different question <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like to put her question to me more formally i shall be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend in his supplementary questions has ranged very wide indeed on subjects which i suspect will principally be covered in the debate in your lordships house on wednesday <e> <s> however for the moment i would say this <e> <s> the local government finance act is the legal base for the current arrangements <e> <s> when it was going through both houses it was believed that there was no need for a sanction beyond the auditors powers of surcharge which indeed are powerful <e> <s> but quite clearly from the figures i have given and from what we are told by the audit commission the situation has now changed <e> <s> that is why this matter was a major consideration in the widdicombe report <e> <s> i do not accept that the government are sitting on their hands <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot tell the noble baroness and the house which authorities are among the that i reported on in my original answer because the audit commission is barred by statute from revealing details of individual audits to any third party including the government <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the audit commissions report to which the noble lord refers is a damning indictment of inefficiency and waste which cannot be tolerated <e> <s> that is all i should like to say for the moment but i shall return to the subject on wednesday <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i hope i have alluded to already this is something which is very much in our minds in considering the responses by local authorities and others to the consultation paper on the widdicombe report <e>", "<cs> no comment my lords <e> <s> i do not think it is in the least amazing <e> <s> what the commission chooses to do is totally within its own remit <e> <s> that is equally the case if it does not think that it is profitable to answer the governments questions or indeed the noble lords questions and that is perfectly above board <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt it very much <e> <s> certainly i have seen reports to the effect but the audit commission would be the people to approach in this matter <e> <s> i will ask them but i doubt it very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear from the audit commissions report the most recent <e>", "<cs> that is a hypothetical question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the audit commissions job as i see it is to conduct investigations and to help the financial health of local authorities <e> <s> obviously it will turn its attention first to those it considers need that help the most <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a thoroughly useful and thought-provoking debate just as one would expect from one introduced by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> it was remarkably apolitical until we heard the speech of the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> i estimate that if i covered all noble lords they would get rather less than a minute each so with your lordships permission i shall not <e> <s> your lordships speeches have brought out the fact that the problems of our inner city areas are complex and deep rooted <e> <s> i must say that i very nearly packed up and went home when i heard the speech of the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> i hope that what i have to say will be relevant to parts at least of every speech <e>", "<cs> i meant my lords that i was able to rip out great sections of things that i should have liked to say <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we have disposed of that particular matter i agree with the noble and learned lord that too many of our urban areas are disfigured by the results of the misdirected solutions of past years <e> <s> it was the most reverend primate who mentioned skelmersdale <e> <s> this was a new town on a greenfield site and one not surprisingly that i have visited on several occasions <e> <s> the government of the day tried to persuade businesses to go to a place they did not want to go to in the first place <e> <s> some businesses were attracted it is true but it was the first place where those who did go sought to make cuts when they rationalised in the late s and early s <e>", "<cs> right my lords <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will in future not describe me as a grey minister who never puts his head over the parapet <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord please to wait for the argument before he starts to criticise what i am saying <e> <s> the metropolitan areas stand to receive million more rate support grant next year and london million more than in the current year <e> <s> the share of grant going to inner cities has also increased <e> <s> authorities with urban programme partnership and programme status get per cent <e> <s> of national block grant compared with a steady per cent <e> <s> between and <e> <s> it is not just in terms of rate support grant that the government assist deprived areas <e> <s> taking one example central government assistance to merseyside is running at over billion a year <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness says that the hip programme for this coming financial year is per cent <e> <s> of what it was last year she is absolutely right <e> <s> but the point i was making was that the total amount of spend on local authority housing is going up by million and that is an undeniable fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not denying that i have tried very hard not to deny it <e> <s> what i am saying and have been saying all along is that what we should look at is not the expenditure of one sector or another <e> <s> we should look at the total expenditure being made <e> <s> that comprises the whole mass and i do not think that we can look at any particular part in isolation <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> she took us to task for saying that we shall be recruiting an environmental health officer to advise the department and to help prepare and publicise examples of good practise suggesting that that was the only environmental health officer in the country <e>", "<cs> that is what it suggested to me <e> <s> there are as the noble baroness pointed out local authorities in this country and they all employ environmental health officers <e> <s> the complaint has been that the government have not understood what environmental health officers are telling them <e> <s> who better to advise government than one of their own fraternity so to speak <e> <s> it is absolutely right that we should employ one such officer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are indeed sites which the nature conservancy council will have to consider on the basis of their having been listed under the act <e> <s> they are making good <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very detailed question <e> <s> if the noble baroness has any particular site in mind i shall of course respond to that if she gives me notice <e> <s> the act sites are given some protection under the act <e> <s> it was decided in that this was not enough and that is why we got the act <e> <s> the government will look at their own sites with great care when there are considerations of development or re-use of those particular sites <e>", "<cs> my lords the investigations needed before a site is either notified or renotified have a scientific basis <e> <s> i have assured the noble baroness opposite that the nature conservancy council have the money <e> <s> they have not told the government that they do not have enough scientists to pursue this particular scheme <e> <s> equally the scientific investigations which are necessary are of themselves very lengthy <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of notifying a site is in a sense temporary in that any operation likely to damage the scientific values of the site which is on a list given to the owner of the site at the time of notification has to be discussed with the council <e> <s> following this a temporary stop notice for four months is put on while agreements can be arrived at <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there has been no problem <e> <s> in fact there has never been a case where a management agreement has been unable to be financed <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were sites of something like the persian carpet beetle i suspect that the beetle would not be rare in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords before i forget the noble lords last point i must say that i agree with him wholeheartedly i hope that the working party will get down to work with the commission and i hope that local authorities will follow the commissions advice using the district auditor or whoever is appropriate in each particular case <e> <s> i must congratulate my noble friend lady cox for the quality of this debate <e> <s> i can however understand my noble friend lord beloffs point but i see he is not here so i will not continue with that <e> <s> i do not therefore propose to make a second speech <e> <s> however i shall do less than justice to the house if i do not pick up just a few points <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham has a favourite trick of putting words into peoples mouths that they did not actually say <e> <s> i was not casting any aspersions whatsoever <e> <s> the definitive version of the report as i made quite clear both at question time on monday and just now is the one that we all have and that is published <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to look very carefully into what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am not particularly interested and i do not expect that he is in the background of our debates in or indeed in our voting records but if he is correct then i shall make an apology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not familiar with the case as i said but i will of course look into this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the th of may comes earlier than anything else going on in the local authority world at the moment <e> <s> that is why i said use your vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both noble lords for their welcome in one case generous and in the other from the noble lord lord dean slightly more cautious of the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> this statement is good news for local authorities but more importantly it is good news for prospective tenants of rented accommodation <e> <s> the housing corporation already has powers to make grants of up to per cent <e> <s> of the costs of rental housing schemes <e> <s> local authority associations have sought similar powers and we are now proposing to give them to them <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean welcomed the consultation exercise which surrounds this proposal of my right honourable and honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the consultation period is two months <e> <s> the statement made it quite clear that any contract entered into after midnight tonight would be caught and of course when the bill gets onto the statute book it will be the legislative base of that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the statement said it is intended that this money shall be found from within existing local authority funds <e> <s> but the whole point about this is rather like the success of the urban development corporations in that it gives the local authorities the opportunity to use enormous leverage and as a result get more houses for less money <e>", "<cs> my lords the government regard housing associations as part of the private sector <e> <s> perhaps that is part of the answer to the last point made by the noble baroness lady denington <e> <s> i shook my head when the noble baroness said that the government were providing per cent <e> <s> grant <e> <s> in fact in this particular instance it is the local authorities who will be providing the per cent <e> <s> grant <e> <s> these sorts of schemes are not yet properly off the ground and i think it is too early to say whether the / per cent <e> <s> mix is right or whether it ought to be altered <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about the war because the housing acts which my noble friends normally complain of were those passed by a more recent labour government <e> <s> be that as it may the amount of money involved is impossible to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have difficulty enough with the present and clearly if i am wrong on my history i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all three noble lords who have taken part in this short discussion <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean of beswick referred to an act of faith <e> <s> the governments first act of faith is of course in the area and in what can be done through the area and to the area through this organ for regeneration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not intend to castigate those particular local authorities in any way <e> <s> i was suggesting that this particular corporation may give a little bit of much needed zip to the regeneration of that whole area <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there is at least one cold snap of varying severity each winter <e> <s> the cold snap that we had last month was the most severe since the winter of <e> <s> the average rate of failure in the united kingdom amounts to one burst per year for every four kilometres of main <e> <s> it may interest the house to know that each burst costs to repair compared with a gross replacement cost of for four kilometres of main <e>", "<cs> my lords if water authorities find it cost effective which i suggest they probably will not from the figures i gave in answer to my noble friend lord campbell they are at perfect liberty to use whatever materials they deem to be necessary <e> <s> i should point out that the polyethylene pipes suffer from <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i was seeking to convey in the most polite of possible terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never lived in or experienced the winter of norway or sweden <e>", "<cs> i expect that the reason has something to do with the snow cover in those parts of the world which would reduce the expansion and contraction of the soil <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment about the planning implications of the governments newly announced policy on the rural economy <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to compare the reception given by both noble baronesses this afternoon with that accorded to the statement of my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture repeated by my noble friend lord belstead yesterday <e> <s> i observe from <e>", "<cs> my lords no not this particular circular <e> <s> there is great emphasis within my department to encourage local authorities to bring forward decisions on these matters at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> equally within the appeal system my department is trying hard to achieve exactly the same objective <e>", "<cs> most certainly my lords but the planning system provides today if you like exactly the same as it provided on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> the local planning authorities are made up of elected councillors <e> <s> that is the best safeguard for the planning system as a whole <e> <s> i cannot believe that if there is a large local outcry any planning authority would be ignorant of that fact and would not take it into account in its considerations as indeed planning authorities have in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for putting his finger squarely on the two points that he mentioned <e> <s> the countryside in this country is principally man-made as a result practically all that there is therein is also man-made <e> <s> if you want good conversation in this country it is certainly the farmer to whom you should principally turn <e> <s> so far as the alternative use of farm buildings is concerned my noble friend again is absolutely right <e> <s> it does not do the cause of conservation any good at all to see crumbling farm buildings wherever they are and whether listed or not <e> <s> to use them is the best way to preserve them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i know that my noble friend takes particular interest in village shops and post offices and the maintenance of the rural economy as a whole <e> <s> this slight change of policy is fully intended to maintain and increase the rural economy as a whole <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i fully accept that this is part of the problem <e> <s> but the subject that we are dealing with today is confined to rural areas where mobility of labour makes the building of houses in some instances necessary on particular sites <e> <s> this has always gone on through the planning system and it will continue to go on through the planning system <e> <s> the point i tried to stress to i think the noble baroness lady stedman is that this change will make <e>", "<cs> my lords not necessarily <e> <s> the whole objective of this policy and indeed the planning system generally is to consider each case on its merits which is the remit of the planning authority backed up of course by the appeals system and ultimately by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing his written answer last night my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture said <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of abandoning the protection of locally or nationally identified environmentally valuable land which includes green belt areas national parks areas of outstanding natural beauty and other regions of good countryside <e> <s> each planning application will still be considered on its merits according to the usual planning considerations <e> <s> as i have said before such considerations are the very rationale of planning authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept with the noble baroness that village schools are part of the rural community <e> <s> but that does not mean that village schools are part of a small community <e> <s> they must have a hinterland from which to draw <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education considers these facts extremely carefully when he authorises the closing of local schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> of course it is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said in answer to the noble and learned lords noble friend the leader of the opposition that if it becomes apparent that planning law needs to be adjusted in this respect it will have to be adjusted <e> <s> whether that will include a right of appeal for objectors as well as a right of appeal for those who have had their applications turned down will need to be investigated in that light <e> <s> but at the moment we do not propose to introduce a third party right of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord pursues a theme that he brought up in our discussion of the trafford park urban development corporation area and constitution order last night <e> <s> i believe it was him but it might have been another noble lord <e> <s> the point at issue is that such areas are covered by my phrase locally or nationally environmentally valuable land <e> <s> there is no intention in the light of the statement to change the local plans on which all planning in this country is based <e>", "<cs> my lords if a debate were to be arranged through the usual channels i am quite certain that either i or one of my noble friends would be delighted to respond to it on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baronesses accept that there were very few peers on the opposition back benches who spoke in that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate on what is by any standards a highly technical bill <e> <s> i agree with all noble lords who have spoken that it is a highly technical bill <e> <s> indeed i have needed to do more homework on this bill than on any other i have been involved in during my time in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the statement was on th december and that was the six weeks period to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said is that we have no intention of specifying something to be revenue which the whole world thinks is capital <e> <s> knowing the speed with which my mind is working at the moment i shall have to reflect on the question that the noble lord has just asked me <e> <s> but i can undertake to give him an answer before the committee stage starts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the three noble lords who have spoken in this very short debate which certainly hotted up in the last -odd minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering points in the best way that i am able in the limited time available <e> <s> if the noble lord lord stallard will let me continue with my speech he may find that he has rather more answers than he expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords that was quick fire-power if ever i heard it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord hooson for their comments on this statement though i am not sure that i am quite so grateful to the noble baroness for her comments <e>", "<cs> my lords that is reading far more into a press notice than actually exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather suspect that in those circumstances whether to accept or reject it would not be my decision <e> <s> the committee might well have a view not only on the drafting but on the substance of the clause itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is the case at all <e> <s> the local government finance bill is by any standards an extremely complicated piece of proposed legislation not only from the point of view of drafting but also for noble lords in all parts of the house including myself to understand <e> <s> although i have no doubt that we shall return to this subject on monday and tuesday next week i do not accept the noble lords contention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has stumped me i am afraid <e> <s> i am not aware that the bill to be introduced in another place today will carry any <e>", "<cs> this part of the bill namely clauses and is designed to define relevant and total expenditure by reference to the rate fund revenue account which is made statutory for the first time <e> <s> it is therefore a revenue account and not a capital one something we will discuss further later on today <e> <s> clearly then it is important that local authorities should know in precise terms what items are to be treated as income to and expenditure from that account <e>", "<cs> local authorities prepare their accounts according to proper practices and their auditor is required to satisfy himself under the local government finance act that proper practices have been observed in the compilation of the accounts <e> <s> these practices are not set out in statute and accountants and auditors in particular the professional accountancy institutes have developed and indeed are continuing to develop a body of accounting practices which are considered proper for local authority accounts <e> <s> the bill also does not specify precisely what the proper practices are <e> <s> as i have already made clear it is not our intention to interfere with local authority accounting <e> <s> what clause of the bill does is to provide that the practices to be applied <e>", "<cs> in looking after this bill i want to be as accommodating as i possibly can be to noble lords in all parts of the committee <e> <s> i take the point that the noble and learned lord does not want my right honourable friend to specify what he calls an improper practice yet another concept with which i suspect we shall have to grapple in a moment <e>", "<cs> this clause provides for and subsequent years a new method of calculating relevant and total expenditure by reference to the items of account debited or credited to the rate fund revenue account required by clauses and <e> <s> the provisions of this clause are designed so that for these future years the method of calculating relevant and total expenditure will be broadly the same as that which has in practice been followed each year since <e> <s> this clause will enable us to fulfil our objective of maintaining the <e>", "<cs> no one who has read the papers over the last few weeks can fail to be aware that clause clause and clause which deal with the validation of past decisions on rate support grant and rate limitation have given rise to much misunderstanding confusion and criticism <e> <s> i observe that the noble and learned lord lord silkin called this a major consitutional blemish and the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead followed that view and said that it was constitutionally offensive <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that confirmation <e> <s> the government did not produce this bill lightheartedly or overnight <e> <s> each subsection was crawled over for days <e> <s> indeed this crawling over was the reason for the statement that i repeated last week which caused a certain amount of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> having heard what he has just said of course the bottom line of all this is the validating reports that have been made by my right honourable friends since and laid before another place <e> <s> one cannot validate a report without validating the decisions that led up to the making of that report <e> <s> it is this about which we are arguing <e> <s> these as the noble and learned lord has himself just said do not necessarily depend on the previously described total and relevant expenditure <e> <s> therefore one must by definition have a wide validatory provision and that is what is found in the bill <e>", "<cs> nobody is more aware than i of the complexity of local government finance <e> <s> at least i can say that it is a good deal less complex since than it was when the party of the noble baroness was in power <e>", "<cs> it was so complex then that there was not a computer in this country to do the calculations and they had to go by satellite every time to columbus ohio <e> <s> that is what i call real complication <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear that the government know what they want to achieve but it is not so clear that the rest of the committee either agree with what they want to achieve or indeed are going to allow us to do so <e>", "<cs> i accept the point made by the noble and learned lord lord silkin that after the passing of this act it will become the law <e> <s> that is quite natural and normal <e> <s> but let us take a court case which is entered into today <e> <s> by the very nature of things it is going to take three weeks or so for this bill to get on to the statute book <e> <s> it is quite likely knowing the speed of the courts and the noble and learned lord will know of this much better than i do that a decision handed down will not be given until after the passing of this act although that decision will have been made on the position under the existing legislation <e> <s> therefore this is something else that quite clearly the bill needs to validate and the draftsman has chosen this particular way in which to validate it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for explaining the amendment so clearly but as i said in my intervention towards the end of the winding-up speech of the noble and learned lord lord silkin in the second block of amendments which we considered this afternoon all we are interested in validating are those reports which have already been made and those decisions leading up to making those reports <e> <s> there is a whole list which i think i am right in saying i gave on second reading as to what still has to be done which will not be covered by this bill <e>", "<cs> if the offer is going to be refused then the offer will be refused <e> <s> as i was saying <e>", "<cs> i should not call it a vain hope <e> <s> however it is a very wide hope <e> <s> what i actually promised to do was to look at two particular amendments and the speeches made by noble lords regarding them <e>", "<cs> in answering this amendment perhaps i may make the general point that in my experience the law is rather like the mills of god it grinds exceedingly slowly <e> <s> i do not think that the noble baroness should be surprised that lawyers have taken so long to make up their minds on the exact formulation that has been produced in this bill <e>", "<cs> did i detect a certain sharpness in those last words of the noble baroness lady david <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham says that he hopes so <e> <s> if i may be sharp in return i do not recall that when the clay cross position was validated by the last labour government any issue of compensation to local authorities was even thought of or considered by the party opposite therefore i do not think that compensation which as i understand it has never been used in this way for local government in the past has any justification for the future and after all the explanatory memorandum says that this will not cost extra money <e>", "<cs> the government do not accept that the local ratepayer has been disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> i have forgotten the name of the act in question but i believe it was the something or other housing act <e>", "<cs> i have now been provided with the title of the act <e> <s> it is the housing finance special provisions act <e> <s> the whole purpose of that act was retrospectively to relieve councils who were liable to financial penalties but had not yet been surcharged <e> <s> that is why i referred to that act <e>", "<cs> as i sought to explain in what the noble and learned lord deigned to call my semantic initial argument i understand that the amendment is improper because of that clause in the bill <e> <s> i attempted off the top of my head to explain that there are no compensation provisions in existing legislation <e> <s> therefore because of clause if it is unamendable i suspect we will not have a definitive <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i personally had crawled over it <e> <s> i said that it had been crawled over which is a different point whether at the weekend or not <e>", "<cs> before i start to answer what has developed into a surprisingly lengthy debate on the amendment considering the scope of the subject the length is principally about other matters i must take a retrospective action <e> <s> in answer to amendment no <e> <s> i said that as i understood the position it contravened clause of the bill and was covered by a money resolution <e> <s> i am now advised that it may well not be within the scope of the money resolution but if the amendment were adopted as of course it still can be in the future another place may decide to invoke financial privilege to reject it <e> <s> that is not to say this is where i am totally at fault and i apologise most sincerely to the committee that it cannot be moved here <e> <s> i promised earlier that i would make the position clear as soon as i reasonably could and i hope that the committee will accept this apology <e>", "<cs> i have absolutely no doubt that the noble baroness and her team will consider most carefully what i have said and what actions they wish to flow from it <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the correction <e>", "<cs> yes both subsections directly bear on the subject of this amendment and indeed any specifications that my right honourable friend may make under the bill when it becomes an act <e> <s> at the top of page subsection says <e>", "<cs> the government are not unfeeling and they are certainly not unaware of the situation in birmingham to which the noble baroness lady david has made reference <e> <s> i should like to remind her that this years rate support grant for birmingham is million more than last year <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has yet again managed to read more into the clause than the clause actually deserves <e> <s> subsections and provide for future years that is the financial year <e>", "<cs> i am shaking it <e>", "<cs> i shall try but whether i succeed only the noble baroness and perhaps her colleagues on the front bench opposite will be able to tell <e> <s> i think it would be best for me to go back to the bill before referring to the terms of this amendment and to look at clause <e> <s> this may or may not save time on the clause stand part debate which i anticipate we shall have fairly shortly <e>", "<cs> i shall try and repeat what noble lords will find in <e>", "<cs> without taking it in particularly rapidly at this time of night i understood that what the noble and learned lord has just said is confirmation of what i said earlier <e> <s> however we shall no doubt both look at <e>", "<cs> time being what it is it may not be possible to send to the noble baroness a written missive it might have to be an oral one <e> <s> however i shall certainly do my best so that she is well armed to attack me tomorrow <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may quickly say that as the noble and learned lord lord silkin has just said clause validates past acts in relation to rate limitation <e> <s> when considering the amendments that we have debated at length this afternoon the nature of the validation provisions that we are seeking in this clause was fully and extensively discussed and indeed as the noble and learned lord has just said voted upon <e> <s> as i explained then and have continued to explain throughout the afternoon our principal concern is to provide absolute certainty about precisely what is validated so that there can be no argument that something done in the past is not valid <e>", "<cs> if there is any uncertainty under the bill there will certainly be even more uncertainty as to what is and is not validated so far as concerns the amendments that have been put down on the marshalled list today <e> <s> i have said that i and the government want certainty and the noble baroness has agreed with me about that <e> <s> perhaps with a bit of luck we shall actually achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baroness the reason the announcement of this decision was deferred it could have been made last week was in deference to her and her putting down the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there is general laughter but that statement happens to be true <e> <s> in answer to the supplementary question asked by the noble baroness this was a complex case in which the inquiry ran on and off for four months <e> <s> the inspector then put a great deal of effort into assessing much complex evidence and presenting it objectively <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> the position is exactly as he has stated <e> <s> however i would point out that the planning permission for the original quarry does not expire until september and so we shall not see overnight the environmental improvements that he wants <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that there has been no deviation from that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made quite clear that they see roadstone being quarried in those places outside the national parks where such a thing is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the technical specifications of what is used as roadstone and indeed ballast on railway tracks is beyond me <e> <s> if i may i shall write to the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords high-quality limestone can on occasions be found outside the national parks and so the situation is rather different <e>", "<cs> my lords since the unit was set up in june schemes in local authorities have been approved involving additional targeted resources of million in <e> <s> under estate actions homelessness initiative some million within this total has been approved specifically to enable local authorities to bring nearly empty council properties back into use to benefit the homeless <e> <s> in the next financial year estate action will have resources of million to support considerably more new and continuing schemes <e>", "<cs> not exactly my lords <e> <s> estate action is concerned with finding solutions to problems on difficult-to-manage council housing estates whereas in housing action areas the prime concern is with modernising run-down private sector housing typically the pre- stock <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of the scheme is to improve the quality of life on council estates <e> <s> as i said estate action is supporting a wide <e>", "<cs> england and wales only my lords <e>", "<cs> it is extra money my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i noted with interest that the noble baroness introduced the block of amendments without condemning rate-capping <e> <s> i understand that it is her partys policy to abolish rate-capping should it get into power <e> <s> i can only hope that her measured tones in introducing the amendments indicate a change of heart for her party in this respect <e>", "<cs> i sought to say that i was delighted that the noble baroness did not raise the matter of rate-capping <e>", "<cs> it depends entirely on the speed of progress of this bill through parliament <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the error has been pointed out to me <e> <s> however while he is speaking about the primary formula as we might call it in this block of amendments will the noble and learned lord say whether or not the amendments intend line to remain as printed in the bill namely divided by rateable value <e>", "<cs> after that vigorous debate i can hardly believe that now i can actually speak for myself rather than having members of the committee putting words into my mouth <e> <s> i was particularly interested in the speech of the noble lord lord graham who suddenly reminded us after this long and as i say vigorous debate that we were talking about a series of amendments <e> <s> what we are discussing of course are alternative formulae to what is proposed in the bill <e> <s> my noble friend and i on numerous occasions now have explained why we had to use formulae <e> <s> we have admitted that it is not the most perfect position in the voltaire sense but nonetheless we have now agreed in committee on a division that formulae are required <e>", "<cs> as the committee well knows i am not expert on local authority procedure but i understand that such a thing can be corrected by a subsequent meeting <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall tell the committee as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> so there would be if we changed the formula <e> <s> i shall return to that matter in a moment <e> <s> for the south yorkshire passenger transport authority the fixed costs were i am advised fully taken into account in the decision on a per cent <e> <s> uplift which is given in the formula under the bill <e> <s> again so far as south yorkshire is concerned the government believe that if concessionary fares do not change and if rail fares rise nearer to the level of bus fares the uplifted expenditure limit that is the expenditure limit plus per cent <e> <s> will require only small reductions in subsidised bus services <e> <s> if the will is there the means are there <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> was i gabbling again <e> <s> i always like to be told when i am gabbling <e> <s> i intended to say that the noble lord lord kilmarnock referred intitially to ilea but that it was the noble baroness lady-ewart-biggs who in my opinion was generalising from a particular case <e> <s> i have no doubt that the case which she quoted is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> as i understand it amendment no which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has just moved takes a rather different track from the amendments that we discussed in the last block <e> <s> i think that the noble and learned lord has made clear that this amendment is primarily designed to assist the london borough of newham though of course it also assists a few a very few other local authorities as the noble and learned lord said <e>", "<cs> i was about to question the noble and learned lord on that very point because in his very interesting introduction to this amendment to which i listened with great care i understood that so far as he could work it out himself and after all it is the noble and learned lord who is moving the amendment this applied to all authorities that were rate-capped for the first time in and <e> <s> have i understood the noble and learned lord correctly <e>", "<cs> so it affects some authorities more than others but it affects all those authorities first designated in <e>", "<cs> in which case of course to that extent it would cover hounslow and tower hamlets as well <e> <s> i do not think that it will benefit the committee if i again explain the process through which the formulae were derived <e> <s> however i must stress that representations made by honourable members in another place and by local representatives when they met my honourable friend the minister for local government were certainly not ignored nor indeed do the government intend to ignore the very interesting speech that the noble and learned lord has just made which will require careful study later <e> <s> he pointed out quite correctly that newham spent per cent <e> <s> over the grant-related expenditure assessment in which is one of the reasons newham was rate-capped in the first place <e>", "<cs> i was at pains to point out albeit comparatively briefly for me that my honourable friend will be going to newham on friday to investigate matters <e> <s> i am afraid that i can give no commitment as to the result <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord would like to take the words that i have uttered in the spirit in which i have uttered them he will know what to do with his amendment <e>", "<cs> my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i was trying to prove that i read the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> this is a remarkably technical amendment although presented so clearly and fairly by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and provide that in setting up the formulae we should use in effect whichever is the more favourable to an authority of the penny rate product or the rateable value figure presently included <e>", "<cs> that was rather a barbed comment <e> <s> i have learned from bitter experience over the last six years that when my noble friend lord renton speaks about drafting any sane sensible minister ducks and ducks very rapidly indeed <e> <s> yes of course i shall take up his point <e> <s> however he did not develop it <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that it helps the committee at all if i continue to repeat myself <e> <s> however we are now in what i can only describe as peculiar and particular circumstances <e>", "<cs> that brings me to the whole subject of changing the local government finance structure which i long to do and which the noble baroness has said is desirable <e> <s> indeed the government intend to do that as soon as they properly can on the basis of the green paper <e>", "<cs> i find it refreshing when the noble baroness asks a straight question which i can understand <e> <s> we spoke about clause in discussions on an earlier amendment yesterday i believe that it was on amendment no although i should not like to swear to that <e> <s> therefore i can say that the consultation power referred to by the noble baroness relates to specifications in all reports and supplementary reports except those three to be made immediately on royal assent to this bill <e> <s> the specifications may be made outside reports and consultation applies <e> <s> however the secretary of state will consider representations made on reports and supplementary reports to be made immediately after royal assent <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment as i understand it is to revoke or amend <e> <s> it is the usual power relating to specifications and it is to cover mistakes which happen and have happened under all governments from time to time <e> <s> the power must be exercised reasonably but i do not wish to enter into the discussion of what is reasonable which the noble and learned lord lord silkin had with my noble friend baroness hooper <e> <s> nonetheless that as i understand it is the position and i hope that it answers the question of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton gives me a magnificent cue to what i was about to say to the committee <e> <s> the amendment seeks to alter a traditional form of wording on consultation <e> <s> the drafting to be found in clause has been used in legislation for many years <e> <s> indeed it was the party opposite which passed the local government act <e> <s> section of that act states <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in the house on monday when my noble friend made that remark <e> <s> however i have heard him say that on many occasions <e> <s> house prices are determined by agreement between private individuals and no government including that of the noble lord have ever attempted to dictate to ordinary people the price at which they may sell their property <e>", "<cs> my lords because of lower inflation and because of other measures taken by this government the standard of living in this country has risen over the last two years <e> <s> the question of the noble lord lord beswick prompted me to investigate the situation as far back as which is why i gave my original answer <e> <s> that information is contained in a graph which is very complicated and i shall put it in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the percentage of mortgage advances made to first-time buyers in the south-east is very close to the average for the country as a whole <e> <s> in greater london it is well above the national average <e> <s> over the period from the last quarter of to the third quarter of first-time mortgages were issued <e> <s> in the rest of the south-east the figure is <e>", "<cs> my lords as i pointed out earlier peoples affairs are their own <e> <s> if a husband and wife wish to take the tremendous step and we know from building society figures that they do of joining together to own their own home i cannot see that that is wrong <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have heard the noble lord say that before <e> <s> that is why the governments right-to-buy policy has excited so much interest <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the fact that the question on the order paper refers to the south-east i think that most people would accept that the main determinant of house prices is the real income of house purchasers <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything either surprising or revolutionary about that <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is a personal circumstance of which i was not aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the building societies association has just published figures for the end of as regards that matter <e> <s> they indicate that the rising trend of arrears in recent years may be reversing although i accept that it is too early to be certain that that is a permanent change <e>", "<cs> my lords again i do not think that there is any relationship at all <e> <s> i do not accept that the governments regional structure has collapsed in the way in which the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords going rate is a very wide term <e> <s> i do not have any comment to make on the top salaries review body especially as i know that it determines my salary <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord nugent is absolutely right <e> <s> we all know the effects of the brain drain and we want to do everything we can to avoid it <e>", "<cs> my lords for the people in those houses it is clearly a good thing <e> <s> for those who want to buy them especially young people and first time buyers there does not appear to be any problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have ever had a better cue in your lordships house than that one <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord aldington <e> <s> i have been extremely conscious throughout our consideration on this bill of the concern of noble lords on all sides of the house to ensure both that the validation is no wider than it needs to be and that it is clearly effective <e> <s> i uttered that on second reading i uttered it in committee and indeed the noble and learned lord lord silkin in introducing this block of amendments quoted my so doing <e> <s> i am therefore most grateful to noble lords on all sides of the chamber for their endeavours to contribute to this aim by their careful and researched amendments and thoughts <e> <s> quite clearly my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for example has spent a lot of time with a wet towel around his head as indeed have other noble lords on this particular and i agree particularly worrying provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point the noble and learned lord is absolutely right which i shall have to answer during the course of this speech <e> <s> a noble lord said that the gentleman in whitehall i suspect that it was the noble and learned lord lord simon again knows best <e> <s> i submit that that is not the case here <e> <s> what we are talking about is the gentleman in whitehall admitting that he is wrong and saying in this bill what he intends to do about putting the wrong right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the way in which she introduced this amendment <e> <s> quite clearly both her explanation on introducing it and my responses in reply in committee require elucidation <e> <s> i have considered her amendments most carefully as i promised at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said at our last discussion was as i admitted on the subsequent amendment totally and completely wrong and i apologised at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not exactly rendered null and void <e> <s> they say that that was the position up to the time of royal assent <e> <s> that will continue to be the position notwithstanding any decision of a court of law <e> <s> therefore since grant has already been paid out under those provisions there cannot possibly be any cost to local authorities under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right in her reading of what occurred at the committee stage during a debate in which she not only participated but also introduced <e> <s> i described the practice as questionable <e> <s> i also said in another part of my remarks that it was not illegal <e> <s> i can well appreciate why the noble baroness is pressing me to expand on these points <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to respond to that slightly indecisive winding-up of the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> when i said and said positively that specifications will not be retrospective i meant that if deficit financing was carried out in this financial year and the specification was made in the next financial year then accounts for would not be covered by specification and therefore the situation regarding the local authority which had practised it in that year would remain exactly the same as it was when it was practising it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would point out to the noble lord lord kilmarnock that because the amendment is to clause it is only relevant to rate-capped authorities <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to persuade the government to put money for homelessness into local authorities i suggest that this would be a very odd way to do it <e> <s> the manner in which the money was spent would have much wider implications than for the rate-capped local authorities alone <e>", "<cs> clearly <e> <s> the homeless person is no more likely or less likely to go to a rate-capped or non-rate-capped local authority <e> <s> this is why if you are dispensing the largesse which the noble lord lord kilmarnock requests of the government this must be done equally and not just for the rate-capped authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to require my right honourable friend to pay compensation to designated authorities for expenditure incurred by them as a result of any changes to the firm intentions for the coming rsg settlement which my right honourable friend announced in january <e>", "<cs> my lords the local authority ombudsman is not an officer of the government <e> <s> i am not prepared to speculate what he will find in any particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i misinterpreted what the noble lord said which fills me with a certain amount of embarrassment <e> <s> in the meantime it may be helpful to the noble lord and to south yorkshire fire and civil defence authority if i say what i was going to say though the noble lord did not ask me to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did last time <e> <s> he is very generous <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the house may or may not remember that my noble friend lord renton bounced me with this idea on schedule stand part in committee <e> <s> what i did very naturally as even such a bad cricketer as i am does with a bouncer was to duck very smartly indeed <e> <s> having done that i then had to spend some time considering the words in <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been made clear by the noble and learned lord this amendment is primarily designed to assist the london borough of newham <e> <s> i told your lordships when we were considering the bill in committee that my honourable friend the minister for the environment countryside and local government would be going to visit newham to investigate matters <e> <s> he did so last friday and heard about and saw the position <e> <s> he reported his findings to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> my right honourable friend has now considered once again the formulae in the bill taking into account the latest available information including my honourable friends findings <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it might be appropriate to respond to the noble lord <e> <s> i said that i was given to understand that the amendment i had proposed refers to newham and to gateshead but not to brighton <e> <s> i shall have to write to him with the details <e> <s> my point was that that was my understanding of the amendment that i was proposing to bring forward at third reading <e>", "<cs> i very much hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i shall certainly do my best but i do not think that it will be possible to have what is the word <e> <s> a colloquy or an exchange with noble lords opposite before monday morning <e> <s> if that will suit i shall undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house for the last time i hope perhaps i may say that a colloquy cannot be written <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i do not recognise anything of the kind <e> <s> we have not halted any schemes but merely subjected them to the requirement for consent as i said in my original answer <e> <s> the government are keen to hear from any authority wishing to put forward worthwhile schemes which are consistent with the governments housing policy objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement was made because we were aware that authorities were preparing many schemes which were merely devices for avoiding the capital control system <e> <s> we therefore had to move quickly <e> <s> but i say again that if any local authority has any scheme that it wishes to be considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state it has only to declare itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking from memory now <e> <s> when i considered the statement which i repeated to your lordships i understood that there were two sheffield schemes <e> <s> one scheme was not caught by the ban and will go ahead under the provisions that sheffield decided upon at the time <e> <s> the second scheme has still to be released as it were for my right honourable friends consent <e>", "<cs> my lords the grants are limited to per cent <e> <s> of the cost of schemes <e> <s> this per cent <e> <s> is approximately equivalent to the subsidy enjoyed by owner-occupiers through mortgage interest tax relief <e> <s> especially when they are combined with index linked finance it should be possible to produce schemes at affordable rents <e> <s> if we had per cent <e> <s> schemes not only would that create municipal housing but fewer schemes would go ahead <e> <s> there are more per cents <e> <s> in per cent <e> <s> than there are per cents <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments objective for the next parliament is to make million more houses available for the owner-occupied sector <e> <s> i readily admit that the private sector will continue to have a role in the provision of rented accommodation but that is no reason why this should be done by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government expect no immediate change in the energy require-ment for new construction work in industrial buildings <e> <s> in the longer term the impact of the proposed deregulation would depend on decisions about insulation levels made by those who commission and build such buildings <e>", "<cs> yes my lords naturally the department of energy has been consulted and it will equally be involved in considering with the department of the environment the response to consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be as well to put this amendment to the government amendment and indeed the whole government amendment into context <e> <s> when i persuaded the noble and learned lord lord silkin at report stage to withdraw an amendment in favour of a government amendment which i promised and which is the subject of amendment no today the amendment i persuaded him to withdraw was to add at the end of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish this one point and then i shall give way <e> <s> i was saying that i agree with my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> the government amendment with the words which noble lords opposite clearly find offensive makes explicit what was previously implicit in the bill <e> <s> there is no additional power in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite say that <e> <s> what i said was that the whole purpose of this power to make specifications relates to where there is doubt in the future so that the whole of local government operates under one specification in regard to the accounts in clauses to of this bill <e>", "<cs> because my lords they remove a doubt and as i said earlier they make explicit what is already implicit in the bill <e> <s> therefore i cannot see why there are grounds for complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> with the leave of the house we intend to apply some specifications for <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be becoming a little emotional this afternoon in this chamber <e> <s> a con was the word used on the last amendment a ploy says my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i may try to be a little more rational and say that in my hands i hold a report <e> <s> it is commonly known as <e>", "<cs> my lords as i moved the amendment i think it appropriate if i parry the iron <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that when the noble lord actually sees the bill he will find that each of the i was going to say anachronisms but that is the wrong word acronyms in the bill are defined <e> <s> i think that that will solve his problem <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments seek to introduce a new clause into the bill which would require my right honourable friend to make payments to local authorities by way of reimbursement for either additional expenditure incurred or expenditure rendered abortive by the bill or for expenditure incurred as a result of any change we have made to my right honourable friends intentions for the forthcoming rate support grant settlement as announced on th january <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will agree with me at this point that i have the position right so far <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all the answer to the request of the noble lord lord underhill is written down in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have no crystal ball and cannot see the future how can i possibly make a declaration on that particular score <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble baroness knew that perfectly well when she asked me the question <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that because i hope that i have explained to the house why the principle is wrong and not only the technical problems <e> <s> however even if the suggestion related to the technical problems what an amazing idea it is <e> <s> the noble baroness obviously wants to cause more confusion to local authorities and i am glad that she withdrew her amendments on compensation which we have just now discussed <e> <s> in the noble baronesss book according to her speeches on the subject there would have been perfect justification for her compensation amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past hour or so there has been enough material to keep your lordships going for at least five wednesday debates and therefore i think it would be inappropriate for me to respond beyond saying two things <e> <s> quite clearly i have not persuaded the noble baroness lady david and quite clearly i never shall <e> <s> she spoke again about

on this occasion i believe that my memory is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my right honourable friend the current secretary of state for education who changed his view and who introduced the idea of the abandonment of clawback <e> <s> however the spending plans of the government this year are realistic because they provide for a substantial increase in authority current expenditure billion more at billion <e> <s> the settlement provides for most local authorities except as i admit those which are rate and precept limited to increase their current spending by / per cent <e> <s> this is well above the expected rate of inflation of per cent <e> <s> i am advised that if authorities spend at inflation in the current year they would get at least million more grant from the exchequer than the firm intentions statement provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that her noble friend agrees with my analysis of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> this bill in no way attempts to smuggle <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that the consultations had taken place before the drafting of the bill and that they had continued practically up to the last moment <e> <s> as to whether consultations will go on in the future consultations about the rate support grant settlement will continue into the future because this is one of the bases of the legislation <e> <s> consultation with the local authority associations is a necessary and desirable part of the process leading up to the making of any rate support grant report or supplementary report <e> <s> provision requiring such consultation is already present in the main legislation in section and section of the local government planning and land act of which noble lords opposite have so much disapproved in their miscellaneous speeches today <e> <s> no further specific provision is therefore necessary in this bill <e> <s> i hope that that answers the noble baronesss question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of the role of the late air chief marshal in the battle of britain but any monument even to someone as distinguished as that would have to be applied for in the normal way <e> <s> for example applicants would need to show that there was a sufficiently influential body of public opinion to support the proposal and to raise enough money to pay for the erection of the statue and its future maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only placing facts before the house <e> <s> i have no doubt that the criteria i outlined in my supplementary answer to the noble lord lord dean of beswick will indeed be fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> of course he is absolutely right although i personally was not involved <e> <s> indeed i was not born at the time <e> <s> nonetheless the expression of solidarity if i may so describe it which has come from all parts of the house today will be borne in mind by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think it is <e> <s> if the government were to put up a monument the government would be expected to pay for it and if a foreign government were to put up a monument that foreign government would be expected to pay for it <e> <s> if therefore a public subscription is raised i see nothing wrong with the public subscription also covering the cost of maintenance <e>", "<cs> not entirely my lords <e> <s> the position is i understand that statues which are erected by the government acting in that capacity are indeed paid for out of public funds <e> <s> other statues are paid for by those who wish to erect them <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think i have grasped the essential facts of the discussion <e> <s> i have said that i will relay those facts to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am not sure that i can do any better <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i should like to comment on that suggestion off the cuff <e> <s> i would however point out that once applicants have found a site they must obtain the consent of its owners <e> <s> they also need planning permission and then the consent of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment under the public statues metropolis act if the site is in a public place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord should feel that way <e> <s> i do not believe that i have been irresponsible or unresponsive in answering this question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend not for the first time has put his finger squarely on the point <e> <s> that is why i did not answer my noble friend lord craigton off the cuff <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility is under the public statues metropolis act and ultimately is with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested by that suggestion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> of course i understand and the noble lord has had support all round the house for pressing this particular point <e>", "<cs> my

own to the committees programme and are using all opportunities to promote the year and its goals <e> <s> other departments are contributing further resources projects and assistance in promoting the year <e> <s> this is evidence of the governments genuine commitment to the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the protection of the ozone layer and the proposed directive on chloro-fluorocarbons is one of the items which will be under discussion in the environmental council tomorrow and friday in brussels <e> <s> i have no doubt that strides will be made in the correct direction <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are talking about in this and indeed any other proposed directive is a treaty which will be entered into by the community as a whole and discussions have to he held both at official level and ultimately at ministerial level before such a thing can be done <e> <s> what i have said is that i expect progress to be made on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords planning for a year such as this takes some considerable time and towards the end of the planning stages the government announced that retrofits would be made to three power stations so as to remove the sulphur emissions from them <e> <s> this will cost about million and will take place between and so the government are taking this issue extremely seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that discussions are going on within the commission to draw many countries attention to numerous different directives that have been passed up to now <e> <s> a point of the year is to establish in peoples minds the relationship between environmental protection and economic development and this is a consideration which the government will have firmly in mind not only thoughout the year but permanently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> this will give the petrochemical industry exactly the fillip that it needs to make our atmosphere cleaner for all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that that is part of the european year of the environment programme which had escaped my notice and i am very grateful that the noble baroness has drawn my attention to it <e> <s> may i put in a little plug for the year and say that his royal highness prince charles is currently opening the uk year of the environment in a speech on teesside <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is exactly why the government announced in the autumn the uk scheme which involves job creation for exactly this sort of purpose through the community programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that is a generous tribute from a man who is not only chairman of your lordships all-party environment committee but also for many years was chairman of coenco <e> <s> which is itself an enabling body of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i rather think that that is a question which is a little detailed for the moment <e> <s> the answer to the broad question is yes the forestry commission is continously in discussion on this matter with my department <e> <s> as to the details i think perhaps i ought to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the two actions to which the noble lord pointed in his supplementary question are mutually exceptable <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i accept my noble friends point absolutely <e> <s> of course the call-in procedure exists for those applications and i must point out that in this particular case to the best of my knowledge and understanding an application has not yet been made on issues which are of more than national importance <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary who has responsibilities for sport among other things acts in the same way as i and any other minister in the department on behalf of the secretary of state from time to time <e> <s> he was not acting in either a planning or a sports capacity when he suggested that this should be a case for listing a building on architectural and/or historical grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen those remarks or any reference to them but i shall certainly draw the noble lords point to the attention of my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the general answer to that question is that local authorities are responsible among other things for the welfare of the people in their electoral areas <e> <s> i am quite sure that they will consider all the factors should a planning application come before them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is a very valid point and i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to note that the noble lord should have such a good memory that he is able to contrast this answer with an earlier answer that i gave on a not dissimilar subject <e> <s> perhaps we have all learnt lessons from that occasion <e> <s> so far as his real point goes it is of course hypothetical but i have heard and listened to what my noble friend sitting behind me said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that in that event the issues would fall to be considered by a different body <e> <s> i do not think that the issues would necessarily be dissimilar <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments bill which is now before a select committee in another place was very generally welcomed and indeed received an unopposed second reading <e> <s> it is a major piece of conservation legislation which balances the equally important needs of navigation conservation and public enjoyment and will establish for the first time an authority with powers to manage the land and water spaces in an integrated way <e> <s> the government will not therefore withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect those are two rather different issues <e> <s> obviously the control <e>", "<cs> my lords with regret i am not going to answer it now because it falls wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> it is a public hybrid bill which as i explained is currently before a select committee in another place <e> <s> it will then go to standing committee followed by report and third reading stages <e> <s> it will then come before your lordships <e> <s> i should have thought that there was plenty of opportunity to discuss the bill at such length as noble lords require <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are claims that or more sites were bulldozed in <e> <s> without having details of precise cases i am unable to comment but if any noble lord including of course the noble baroness has identified such sites i shall be very interested to look into the matter <e> <s> of course we shall not know the precise position of the reported underspend until final end-year figures are available <e> <s> naturally we are concerned at the possibility of underspend <e> <s> i can confirm that there are arrangements for the carry-forward of underspend to the following years budget <e> <s> if it occurs some of that underspend will be as a result of slippage <e>", "<cs> my lords yes certainly <e> <s> these grants are decided well in advance <e> <s> in - the budget provision for rescue archaeology grants was some million for it is million <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm the speculative figure which has been given in certain parts of the media <e> <s> i am advised that the figure will be nothing like that it will be significantly lower <e> <s> i am unable to comment on the report of the select committee on the environment of another place on heritage buildings and ancient monuments <e> <s> the report was published only on th february last and my right honourable friend is still considering the recommendations contained therein <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure of what my noble friend is thinking <e> <s> i do not know of any problems in that area <e> <s> if my noble friend has a specific example i shall be interested to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was directed specifically to english heritage <e> <s> as i am sure the noble and learned lord knows well welsh heritage comes under the welsh office <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think it does <e> <s> i observe that one of the options on which the london residuary body is consulting is that the heath should be owned and managed by the london borough of camden <e> <s> two of the three boroughs involved would agree with this and the third would not <e> <s> therefore i do not think that it is a plus for a london-wide solution along the lines that the noble baroness has identified <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling but i am speaking entirely from memory now that the residuary bodies individually are obliged by law to produce annual reports <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall advise my noble friend and certainly look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the london residuary body has identified the three options referred to by the noble lord since when there is a fourth option which is that the city of london should own and manage the heath partly financed by the city itself and partly by a capital endowment from the london residuary body <e> <s> it is these four options which are currently being considered and consulted upon <e> <s> once the results of those consultations have been studied by

abolition bill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the residuary body <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it was the anniversary of the transfer of the heath to the london residuary body and it was also the first anniversary of the abolition of the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i expect a final decision will be made in the spring of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i absolutely agree <e> <s> this is why i am pleased that the london residuary body has taken this matter extremely seriously <e> <s> it has issued as i have said several times two consultation papers on the matter <e> <s> the first three options in the second consultation paper are there because they are the front runners as a result of the first consultation and there is the new option that has been added to which i have just referred in answer to the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i most certainly can <e> <s> under the provisions of the local authorities goods and services act the london scientific services may offer their services to any other public authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody has suggested that the final resting place as it were for the london scientific services has to be found with any great speed

nd march this year <e> <s> according to an assessment based on the likely level of demand for services prepared by consultants for the london residuary board the likelihood is that during the course of the year it will fall to <e>", "<cs> my lords i must disagree with the noble baroness <e> <s> my understanding is that the london scientific services provide now that they have always done a consultation service <e> <s> as i said in answer to my noble friend lord cranbrook this can be done now as in the past for any local authority body who so desires <e>", "<cs> my lords the london scientific services were before abolition employed by the greater london council <e> <s> and the greater london council purported to be a london-wide body <e> <s> many noble lords would dispute that purportion if there is such a word <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that i gave a rather off-the-cuff answer to my noble friend last week <e> <s> i have since confirmed that the london residuary body is required under the local government act to publish an annual report on the discharge of its functions <e> <s> my right honourable friend is required to lay such reports before the house <e> <s> the annual report and accounts for were laid before your lordships on th november last <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the leader of the house said during the second reading on th april at col <e>",

with air chief marshal sir christopher foxley-norris in his capacity as chairman of the battle of britain fighter association <e> <s> in a letter to me dated st march this year he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lords last point but i am afraid that the noble lord lord dean has misinterpreted my right honourable friends letter which i have in front of me <e> <s> i should like to quote from that <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it would be a very sweeping thing for me to suggest that the government could cover what my noble friend calls the trifling sum involved <e> <s> it is suggested to me at this moment without knowing details of the statue in question that the capitalised sum for maintenance could be between and <e> <s> in other words what we are expecting is a capitalised annual maintenance for some years <e> <s> it would be difficult for the government to commit themselves to that at this time <e>", "<cs> as has already been made clear not by me in answer to supplementary questions but by my noble friend lord balfour who asked this question it has been the policy of successive governments all governments since not to make payments of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly grateful to my noble friend for putting into a very few words what i have been attempting to explain to your lordships in rather too many <e>", "<cs> my lords sponsorship means exactly that namely the provision of a capital sum <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said on th march the first thing that has to happen is that we have to have a proper application which i advised the association today to submit to my right honourable friend as soon as possible <e> <s> i think that would be if i quote my words correctly sympathetically entertained <e> <s> what the noble lord has just said in his supplementary question is proof of my opening remarks this afternoon <e> <s> there appears already to be sufficient public support <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can usefully add anything to the words i have already uttered on this subject sympathetic means sympathetic <e>", "<cs> my lords sponsorship comes from surprising places as occasionally does advertising in your lordships house <e> <s> i am sure that suggestion will be welcomed by the sponsors <e>", "<cs> my lords the government approved last year a grant of to support this worthwhile project and i am glad that i am able to tell the house that we have now agreed to make a further available in the current year <e>", "<cs> no my lords i understand that it is in the region of per cent <e> <s> and that watch asked for about for the current year <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the government are giving <e> <s> the project has attracted a considerable amount of private sector sponsorship in excess of which is why the individual packs are remarkably cheap <e> <s> the involvement of young people generally in the european year of the environment is a distinct project of the british committee for the european year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i certainly agree with both the points made by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> the government are most grateful for the work of my noble friend lord buxton who chairs the media panel of the european year of the environment committee <e> <s> the blue peter series and also the wild side of town programmes on bbc have made a tremendous environmental impact among <e>", "<cs> my lords to a certain extent <e> <s> i received a delegation from norway at the end of last year on exactly this subject and i had to make the point that not only is this transboundary pollution but there is also a certain amount produced in the countries which are themselves complaining <e>", "<cs> my lords breaches of the directive can be settled in the ultimate instance only by the european court <e> <s> as to the current position regarding the court i accept that one and only one legal proceeding has been started by the commission in respect of water in tower hamlets <e>", "<cs> my lords the general comment that i made at the beginning of my answer that no water from a public water supply is a danger to health includes nitrates as well as any other of the masses of parameters within the directive <e> <s> however we are considering the recommendations for action contained in the report of the nitrate coordination group together with the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> an integrated approach is needed with contributions from both the agriculture and the water industries <e>", "<cs> my lords again i must reiterate the point that there is no risk to public health <e> <s> a programme of improvements on nitrites is already well advanced and an application has been made to the commission under article <e> <s> we hope to resolve this matter shortly with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a detailed and specific question that i shall have to answer in writing <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that i shall certainly do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs has provided an opportunity to return once more to the subject of the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> i congratulate her on her perspicacity in picking up this report of the ncvo as indeed has every other speaker in this short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may finish the point i can imagine that the noble baroness is about to complain about my speech because i have not referred to the voluntary bodies once <e> <s> if she will give me time to make my speech in the way that i intend to she will find that there is a direct relevance to everything i have said at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords patience <e> <s> this has led to an increase in accountability and if successor

particular problems for the voluntary sector in liverpool <e> <s> they are however caused not by abolition but by local factors a point which i suspect he and his party appreciate full well in the current context <e> <s> district councils have failed to act in a co-ordinated way to provide transitional funding <e> <s> no scheme has been set up under section of the local government act to provide support for the merseyside-wide voluntary sector <e> <s> we in central government help through the urban programme <e> <s> liverpool itself is a partnership area knowsley the wirral sefton and st helens are programme authorities however the voluntary sector would do well to make its case not to me but to the local authorities on merseyside <e> <s> we must see what comes out of todays election and whether a more sympathetic line is adopted there towards the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> on nd december my honourable friend the minister for housing urban affairs and construction undertook consultations under section of the new towns act inviting comments on the proposals of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment to wind up the new town development corporations of aycliffe and peterlee and of washington on st march to dispose of their remaining assets to the private sector to give english estates the opportunity to purchase any unsold industrial assets and to transfer any remaining assets and liabilities to the commission for the new towns <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his introductory remarks and i shall of course pass them on to my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that a proper basis of comparison should be the number of patients treated which as the house will know has increased by million since <e> <s> i am aware of course that there could be some anomalies in this calculation and it is a matter at which the government are looking <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact remains that in cases were treated and in that figure had risen to an increase of million <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the noble lord may i say that i am aware that he has recently been in hospital <e> <s> i hope that he has fully recovered not only from the cause for his admission but also from any effects he might have felt about having come out <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mention wales or indeed scotland because in the time in which i had to prepare for the question i was not able to get the figures from the relevant departments <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out the error of my ways <e> <s> so far as his supplementary question is concerned yes i am well aware that one of the major problems is the management problem <e> <s> that concerns first the relationship between general practitioners and consultants and secondly the information that the general practitioners need as part of their thinking on referral for a particular consultation in terms of knowing where the waiting list for a particular specialty is lowest <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had it explained to me in quite those terms <e> <s> i have established that where there is a will there is a way <e> <s> i know of one dermatologist who recently managed to reduce his waiting list time from six months to two weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i am advised that moorfields hospital which is another specialist hospital was at one time actively promoting the admission of patients so that they could carry on with their teaching work <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that the advances in medical science have a bearing on the matter <e> <s> i shall go further and say that what matters for individual patients is not the size of the list but how long they must wait for treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords the million in the fund to which i referred was first available in february of this year <e> <s> it is too soon to see any results <e> <s> so far as the number of patients treated is concerned i know that the noble lord has a fixation about the figures being unreliable because of repeat treatments <e> <s> however fashions in medicine in some specialties have demanded that in any case <e> <s> also as the noble lord will know from his weekends experience people are not normally in hospital without good reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear of the noble lords health history <e> <s> but i suspect that the consultant the general practitioner or whoever referred him in the first place treated the noble lord quite rightly as a patient for each individual incident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that this act came up through the channel as it were of the voluntary bodies <e> <s> i am also aware that on second reading both in this house and in another place the government made it clear that those sections of the act which have significant resource implications would be implemented only when the necessary funds could be made available <e> <s> the major consultation must be between central and local government particularly on costs and implementation arrangements <e> <s> however i understand that my honourable friend the minister for the disabled intends to write shortly to the steering committee established by the interested disability organisations to discuss implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock has put his finger squarely on the point <e> <s> it is that the local authorities have changed their minds on this issue <e> <s> we are now advised that the additional costs arising from the implementation of sections and would be about million to million a year <e> <s> there would be a further million in respect of section <e> <s> if the whole act were brought into effect it is now estimated that by the time it was fully operative it would cost some million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i say to my noble friend that i am sure that

result of a conference which my noble friend and i attended about a fortnight ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can write letters to particular organisations but i have said that there will be discussions through the steering committee <e> <s> i have given a particular commitment on the subject of mencap to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords no i most certainly do not know of any health district or region which has discharged patients from long-stay hospitals into the community without making certain that satisfactory arrangements are made in the community <e> <s> if the noble baroness or any other member of your lordships house would like to give me evidence i shall certainly look into the matter because i regard it as a most serious point <e>", "<cs> my lords if a bill receives royal assent under false pretences then i would agree with the noble lord <e> <s> but on this occasion it was made clear that there were resource implicatons <e> <s> i do not therefore think that false pretences apply <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the then minister said that he would like that part of the act to become operative by this summer for school-leavers <e> <s> i have explained about the discussions with local authorities and why that has proved to be impracticable <e> <s> i suggest that the point about different blocks of money is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords no i could not give the house an example of that <e> <s> i was pointing out that this act was not an example <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is true knowing as i do that we

like to make any prognosis <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the position it was deemed extremely unlikely that the act would be implemented immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat as i think i have done twice so far during this question time what my noble friend the then minister said in another place on second reading of this bill that it would be implemented when resources were found <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> with regard to a public bill he is absolutely right <e> <s> this was a private members bill as the noble lord will confirm

am well aware of the feeling on this matter <e> <s> both private members bills and government bills if that is the right expression are sometimes delayed in their implementation while resources are found to implement them <e> <s> this is such a case <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the draft regulations for the reformed housing benefits scheme to be introduced in april merely carry forward existing policy for meeting the costs of alarm systems through housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady is absolutely right <e> <s> this should be part of community care policy and not part of housing policy <e> <s> the draft regulations should not result in any loss of benefit provided local authorities are awarding housing benefit to meet the costs of alarms systems where they are provided because of the type of accommodation rather than because of the individuals personal needs and those individuals could lose some financial support to which they have never been entitled <e> <s> in those circumstances we would expect the local councils to make up the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i have already said that but not through the housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness has answered her own question <e> <s> the answer is as she knows full well that the community care budget is the one that should pay in these circumstances <e>

the country and i am well aware of the importance of them <e>", "<cs> no my lords i most certainly was not aware of the last point the noble baroness made <e> <s> speaking more generally local social services authorities already have a duty under section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act to provide disabled persons with various forms of assistance in the home where need has been determined <e> <s> the house knows that very often in these cases the need would be determined and therefore the provision of an alarm system could be made under these provisions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i absolutely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i am advised that the department knows of no case where these facilities have been denied to anyone through inability to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be careful to distinguish between the two types of alarm <e> <s> as i understood the noble lady in her question she was talking about a neck alarm whereas i have made it quite clear that the fixed alarm would be eligible under the housing benefits scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister for health <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i think that i go straight to the heart of the matter when i pick up the argument of the noble lord lord winstanley that what we are talking about is a balance between the rights of children and the rights of parents usually but by no means always with the social services department in the middle striving to maintain that balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend for his wise advice <e> <s> most certainly i shall pass his comments to my right honourable friend <e> <s> however not quite answering his question perhaps i may make the point that the regional health authority has set up a second opinion panel with six doctors from leeds oxford and from the region <e> <s> the panel is headed by a child psychiatrist <e> <s> therefore the allegations which are certainly around namely that there is medical malpractice going on is something which by no means has been proven <e> <s> certainly the rights of the children in this particular respect are being looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for speaking from the depth of her experience in this matter <e> <s> of course family courts have exercised the minds of two of my noble and learned friends over a considerable length of time <e> <s> i know that my noble and learned friend currently on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> it was a bad use of english and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i agree with the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i do not understand either <e> <s> i am advised that according to law the time at which parental rights are actually taken away is not the place of safety order stage but the interim care order stage which is usually about a month later <e> <s> therefore i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i hope that it is one of the points the inquiry will establish <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i go further and say that this excitable reporting has done nothing but damage an already delicate situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go so far as to agree with the thought that i suspect underlies the question asked by the noble baroness namely that the law in this area is in a mess <e> <s> nevertheless the government admit that there is need for change <e> <s> the children and young persons amendment act when implemented will give parents a new right to be made full parties to care proceedings with the corresponding right of appeal <e> <s> our proposals in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords not yet <e> <s> however with a bit of luck i hope that i can do so by the end of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords that might well be something which comes out of the current inquiry <e> <s> as i have just pointed out to the noble lord lord bottomley we do not yet know who the assessors will be still less do we know what the inquiry will recommend <e> <s> that is something for the future but i firmly take my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords while a debate in this house is a matter for the usual channels i am of course ready to receive advice wherever it comes from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition because i tried to make clear in answer to earlier supplementary questions that our minds are not totally closed <e> <s> we shall of course have to listen to the results of this inquiry <e> <s> we have not yet set the terms of reference <e> <s> these are under discussion with the distinguished high court judge <e> <s> the noble lord gives me an opportunity to express regret that on thursday i may have given the impression that the inquiry would definitely report at the end of september <e> <s> i intended to say that we hoped that the inquiry would report then <e>", "<cs> my lords disposable insulin syringes and needles will be available free for diabetics on prescription from st september this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend about their very trying daily routine <e> <s> a press notice was issued when my honourable friend the minister for health announced on th may that disposable syringes would be prescribable by general practitioners from st september <e> <s> all gps and retail chemists will be sent details of prescribing arrangements during august <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am advised that the necessary number of syringes will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the cost of these disposable needles may well approach million in a full year <e> <s> however we shall have to await the uptake to see whether in fact that will be the cost <e> <s> we should like to make blood glucose testing strips prescribable in due course <e> <s> but that is a subject like many others that will have to be considered with competing demands for national health service resources <e>", "<cs> my lords new hospitals are usually built in stages involving a series of building schemes <e> <s> information held centrally shows that health building schemes each costing over million were completed in the period april to march <e> <s> a further have been completed since april and over more are planned for completion by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for recognising that this is indeed an impressive record <e> <s> in fact there is more hospital building going on now than ever before <e> <s> it is also true that health authorities are having difficulty in recruiting sufficient qualified staff in particular locations and specialties <e> <s> nevertheless the total number of nursing and midwifery staff has increased by since september <e> <s> even allowing for staff required to maintain the level of services following the reduction in working hours in this period this still leaves an increase of for service expansion <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot answer that question without notice <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are talking on the whole in this rebuilding programme of those patients whom i might describe as the physically disadvantaged <e> <s> we recognise that small hospitals can make a valuable contribution to the delivery of health care <e> <s> the building programme includes schemes for the upgrading and refurbishment of small hospitals as well as large hospitals <e> <s> but it is for the regional health authorities to decide on the proper mix of facilities in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can help the noble lord very well but he can probably answer his own question as he was secretary of state at the time <e> <s> i can tell the house that information held centrally shows that health building schemes costing over million have been completed since compared with from to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i approve of annual general elections if that would result in leaping backwards and forwards to the imf <e> <s> on the more serious point that the noble lord made it is for the health authorities and the hospital authorities to satisfy themselves that the living accommodation for nurses is suitably placed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the public sector <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the press reports <e> <s> i know that the provision of midwifery services which includes the beds and so on is a prime consideration in the planning of new hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that i was answering a question about england but i am sure i can get the information for the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be wise for me to comment on a particular case but nonetheless there are usually in fact always so far as i can tell very good reasons for providing new hospitals at the expense of closing old ones <e> <s> however i am aware of one case in the west country where a hospital due for closure has been kept open longer to help to reduce the size of the waiting list <e> <s> so various factors come into play here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have been inaccurate in my responses in your lordships house <e> <s> what i should perhaps have said was that i took the question to mean that it related to england and to the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> most certainly we shall not ignore that aspect <e> <s> i mentioned in answer to an earlier supplementary question two of the measures we were taking to help solve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble baroness and to the noble lord for their general welcome of this order <e> <s> clearly there are some detailed questions about which i shall do my best to talk <e> <s> equally clearly there are some points which will need a second look especially those of the noble lord lord banks who of course is an acknowledged expert in this particular subject whereas i equally clearly am not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger and to the noble lord lord banks for their fairly moderate responses to the statement <e> <s> i am sure the whole house will join with me in welcoming one particular aspect of the statement <e> <s> now that we are back on an even keel with the annual upratings the increase in retirement pension seems a much more satisfactory amount than at the two previous upratings although they were of course both fully in line with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has no present intention to means test child benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe he would but the quotes i used were to illustrate the point that not even beveridge intended that the pension benefit should be the total income of pensioners and nor is it in per cent <e> <s> of the cases <e> <s> that is a point which i made clear earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i must have skipped that part of my notes <e> <s> i shall make an opportunity to write to the noble lord on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course we shall respond to the report of the social services committee of another place in due course <e> <s> i should point out that this year health authorities have received cash increases in their resources of an average per cent that is per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> last week my honourable friend the minister for health announced an extra allocation of million for the three thames regional health authorities which have been facing special additional pressures as the result of the large number of aids patients that we are having to treat <e> <s> in total this year we have allocated million extra to those three regions <e>", "<cs> my lords no not to the best of my knowledge <e> <s> the money is given as a <e>", "<cs> my lords the money that the government provide through section grants and about which i think the noble baroness is talking is for more general purposes <e> <s> in other words it must cover a wide geographical spread and not the specific instance to which she refers <e>", "<cs> partially my lords <e> <s> the act has been brought into effect <e> <s> it requires health authorities to report by march <e> <s> the government will be issuing guidance to the health authorities shortly so that they can prepare reports <e>", "<cs> my lords the subjects for debates are matters for the usual channels but i feel sure that they will have noted the noble lords concern <e> <s> in due course i hope will mean shortly <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that clarification my lords <e> <s> i shall bear the point in mind and refer it to my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very wide matter indeed <e> <s> as the noble countess will be aware we have asked sir roy griffiths to report on financial support for people with various disadvantages who live in the community <e> <s> for the moment while the whole house will agree that the subject of aids is very serious indeed it is inappropriate to treat the needs of aids patients differently from those of patients suffering from other serious conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord the percentage increases but i can tell him the latest figures <e> <s> in the united kingdom at the end of september there were reported aids patients of whom had died <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises an interesting point <e> <s> however conditions of hygiene sanitation and mosquito infestation vary widely within countries <e> <s> the leaflet therefore lists what is appropriate for each country as a whole <e> <s> it would not be practical to go into greater detail in a leaflet for the general travelling public <e> <s> as to his wider point i think people should be encouraged to believe that their health is the most precious thing they have <e>", "<cs> my lords it is revised as often as the joint committee suggests it should be <e> <s> there is no bar on finances or anything else in this matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad to say that we are getting better <e> <s> last year million leaflets were issued <e> <s> this year the figure is million <e> <s> we are having a drive on uptake for example among association of british travel agents members but also in places like airports and points of exit and entry <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing his views i am not surprised that the noble lord has made a quantum leap in this direction <e> <s> while the government are aware that some studies completed recently report a higher than average incidence of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i wish to goodness we could put <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am aware that there are clusters in this country totally unconnected with anything to do with nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords the disease we are talking about is leukaemia and the normal treatment for leukaemia would be appropriate in this case as in any other <e> <s> as to whether we totally accept sir richard dolls report it recommends further study and it is the further study that we are carrying out <e>", "<cs> my lords the point by the noble earl lord halsbury is freely available in the published information <e> <s> whether we should do more than that i shall of course consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i have given false reassurances <e> <s> i have said twice now that this matter is unproven <e>", "<cs> my lords our intention is to add this combined vaccination to the childhood immunisation programme in approximately a years time <e> <s> it will be administered in place of and at the same time as the present vaccination against measles in the second year of life <e> <s> the exact date will be announced as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the present uptake for measles vaccine is per cent <e> <s> in england and wales <e> <s> we are making every effort to increase the uptake <e> <s> i am aware of the situation in sweden and the united states with the triple vaccine <e> <s> we hope that it will be repeated here <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i remember that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i expect there will be <e> <s> at the moment all district health authorities have medical officers responsible for immunisation purposes <e> <s> i shall bring this matter to their attention in a speech that i am due to deliver to them next week <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the noble lord listened to the wireless this morning when the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs spoke <e> <s> we are obviously extremely keen that as soon as possible this disease should no longer exist in the world <e> <s> one of the ways in which we shall achieve its elimination in this country is to increase the uptake of immunisation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend has described the plight of those unfortunate people very well indeed <e> <s> i agree that compensation as such will not be appropriate <e> <s> throughout that unfortunate period we were relying on what i might call state of the art technology <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my right honourable friend is well aware of the tremendous sympathy which abounds in this country for those people <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained in answer to an earlier supplementary question throughout this unfortunate period we were using what i described as state of the art technology <e> <s> so far as i know the governments knowledge was up to date at all times <e> <s> nonetheless there is no doubt that factor viii was contaminated <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said neither medical science nor technology was initially able to prevent the devastating impact of the disease <e> <s> the availability of heat treatment processes and screening tests provided a breakthrough in the safety of factor viii serum from whatever source <e> <s> no haemophiliac patients are known to have been infected with the aids virus following the use of blood products in the past months <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an answer to that question <e> <s> however i hope that it will come very soon and i take the noble baronesss point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will have that point in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will of course consider the first two points <e> <s> as regards the last point we have provided to each of the six haemophilia reference centres in england so that they may provide haemophiliacs and their families with the specialist hiv counselling that is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that <e> <s> i shall look into it <e> <s> what i know is that no untreated or unscreened blood products are now in use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that scheme is comparable but i shall certainly make sure that it is looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking this unstarred question this evening the noble viscount lord hanworth continues a debate which i understand has been going since the war <e> <s> certainly it has been given greater impetus recently in the light of the high level of awards for damages given by the courts in some cases in recent years <e> <s> the noble viscount covered a wide range of topics in his speech and as a newcomer to this subject i am particularly grateful to him and to the noble lord lord ennals for giving me notice of the matters with which they were especially concerned <e> <s> because matters raised by other noble lords and indeed noble and learned lords have ranged somewhat beyond the subjects with which i normally deal i hope that they will permit me to write to them on any point i am not able to deal with satisfactorily today <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly recognise that <e> <s> in preparation for the debate i had the advice so far as i was able to obtain it of my noble and learned friends department <e> <s> however i hope that during the course of my speech i recognised the fact that this is a wide area and i take the noble viscounts point <e>", "<cs> my lords health authorities have a statutory duty to keep within their budgets <e> <s> therefore they have a duty to examine all reasonable options when service reductions have to be made <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord that it is not helpful if problems are exaggerated and wild proposals mooted which turn out to be totally <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be unreasonable to expect and the government do not pretend that the sums allocated to health authorities should cover all demands on their services <e> <s> from time to time pressures may be such that some services must take priority over others and health authorities must balance the cost of service developments and increasing workloads against other calls on available resources <e> <s> the detailed matters which the noble countess brings to the attention of the house are of course for the managers and chairmen of the health authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords under the last labour government acute beds fell by an average of some per year <e> <s> they have fallen by under the conservatives <e> <s> there are million cases that is over a million more in-patient cases than in now being treated a rise of per cent <e> <s> i do not accept that there is a direct relationship between bed closures and waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords last week the noble lord asked my noble friend a series of questions on this subject <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend adequately covered it in his answers <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the recent storm damage i understand that the regional health authorities rather than the district health authorities have taken it upon themselves to provide the finance <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a situation where no one can ever be happy <e> <s> what i sought to point out was that hard decisions constantly have to be made and that is why we have managers in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is somewhat hypothetical <e> <s> when i suggest that noble lords wherever they may sit refer matters in the first instance to the hospital authorities concerned i am always prepared to take the point on board if a satisfactory answer is not produced <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are naturally concerned that all staff working in the health and personal social services are protected against violence <e> <s> a department of health and social security advisory committee on violence to staff has been established and will report to my right honourable friend the secretary of state in the early spring <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last point which my noble friend has made it is very difficult where specific problems are encountered in individual hospitals and units to make public funds available <e> <s> on the wider question i take my noble friends point <e> <s> employers have a duty under section of the health and safety at work act to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is all very well unfortunately it does not stop aggression <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the committee will draw evidence not only from the medical and nursing professions but also from the social security organisation of the department as well <e> <s> during the discussions on the report we have heard a number of instances of best practice <e> <s> one of the things which the report will seek to do is to make sure that those practices are widely disseminated to every level <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble lord is referring to the triage system which is being evaluated in i think i am right in saying three hospitals at the moment <e> <s> the reduction of waiting times through the use of nurses to see accident and emergency patients before a doctor in order to direct them quickly to the most effective clinician would seem to me to be a reasonable solution to this very worrying problem <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> in my original answer i said that the committee would report to my right honourable friend in the early spring <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement currently being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister for health on haemophiliacs infected by the aids virus <e> <s> this statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both the noble lords lord ennals and lord kennet for their immediate and generous response to this statement <e> <s> i certainly agree that the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for putting the point of view of these benches <e> <s> i should point out that the fund is unique in that it is specifically for those people who are facing the singular and tragic circumstances of haemophilia and hiv infection <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes extremely wide of this statement but as i said in the debate last week this matter will continue to engage the energies of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for underlining that point <e> <s> of course in order to be in a position to pay compensation there must be something that requires compensation <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord ennals that can only be established through our legal system and therefore compensation would not be appropriate in this particular case whereas an <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the estimates of the haemophilia society with whose figures we do not disagree i regret to tell the house that there are some hiv infected people <e> <s> of that number have aids and so far have died <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that this payment is in settlement of a claim <e> <s> as i have already explained it is an <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords and the country remains extremely grateful to those people who continue to give blood at this very difficult time <e> <s> not only is the blood tested initially before full amounts and futher amounts of blood can be given but the blood products are now also heat treated <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i need a little more notice of that question <e> <s> if i may i shall look into it and write to the noble lord lord sefton <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an important and wide-ranging debate and we have heard a number of thoughtful contributions from different parts of this house <e> <s> we are of course covering a number of important technically complex and sometimes controversial issues in these regulations <e> <s> however if i were to concentrate on the speech of just one noble lord i should be here for a good minutes and if i were to concentrate on those many points made by all noble lords who have spoken in this debate i should be here for well over an hour which i do not think would be a proper use of the time of the house <e> <s> nonetheless i shall do my best to return to the particular issues that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very valid debating point but pensioners are backed up by income support where that is necessary <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lords question as usual has a lot more implications than the ones which are obviously apparent and i shall therefore consider the question which he has just asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords the way we normally work out these things is by taking samples from social security offices so that we can arrive at an estimated figure <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness is well aware of that practice <e> <s> when we did that for this particular group those who currently receive or who will receive a week we discovered that people were likely to lose out <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i did not mean <e> <s> i meant the that i have just referred to <e> <s> there are people who currently receive considerably more than that in allowances <e> <s> the noble baroness looks confused <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true but one can work on percentages <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like to work out the percentage of of people namely the total number of longterm sick and disabled one can carry that forward in exemplification for the future position <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with that <e> <s> what i am not prepared to agree to is that housing benefit is necessarily the right way to pay for the alarms which is what i was endeavouring to explain to the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> i am therefore asking sir roy griffiths to look at the issue of funding for alarm systems and other forms of domiciliary care in his wider review of community care <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord was listening when i made my opening speech <e> <s> i explained then and i am prepared to stick to it that the position now is that there will be per cent <e> <s> fewer losers than there were at the time when parliament approved the social security legislation <e> <s> the relative figures were given in the technical annex which was supplied to both houses at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to study the implications of that question <e> <s> i said that the regulations were amended from our original unpublished draft to make sure that any alarm system which was an integral part of the building would be covered by the housing benefit regulations <e> <s> within this any dwellings in the groups i have mentioned namely for the elderly and the disabled would be included <e> <s> in practice the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords thanks to the warning given me by the noble countess i have investigated this matter <e> <s> i have been advised that resources for children with special health needs are not at issue in any region of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is as i have been advised <e> <s> but that does not necessarily mean that there is need for those beds within a health authority <e> <s> many of those matters as the noble countess will know well are decided on a regional basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals knows better than anyone that the regional planning system covers all the activities in a region <e> <s> those are reviewed annually both by officials and ministers <e> <s> i can advise the house that we are currently devising ways to help health authorities to improve their monitoring which is one of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect the question on the order paper is addressed not to acute services but to the requirements of children with special needs <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to address a question to the government generally on the point that he makes i or one of my noble friends would be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed all the therapies that the noble baroness mentions are extremely important to children with special needs <e> <s> the government are encouraging authorities to raise their recruitment of these specialists <e> <s> i am advised that that campaign is going well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little general at this moment but i can advise the house that there are no children with mental handicap in hospital in either somerset or worcester <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i shall certainly take on board the point that the noble countess has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the hospice intended to phase in its total complement of beds over a period <e> <s> what my reply meant was that the first tranche will go ahead as expected <e>", "<cs> my lords over a period yes <e> <s> that period is now expected to be five years <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of the baby that the noble countess has brought to the attention of the house <e> <s> it is a very tragic circumstance <e> <s> the government sympathise with the predicament in which such children and their parents find themselves through no fault of their own <e> <s> however in the case of that particular hospital the matter of resources is not in question <e> <s> it is a matter of a shortage of trained nursing staff <e> <s> regrettably it is impossible to conjure trained staff out of thin air <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am on record as saying that demand for medical services is indeed boundless <e> <s> so far as the west midland regional health authority is concerned the region received per cent <e> <s> more money in real terms last year than it did in <e> <s> that enabled it to carry out per cent <e> <s> more in-patient treatments in than in <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the consultants in charge of the case mentioned by the noble countess in her first supplementary question felt that the operation that was necessary could have been carried out at liverpool so the situation is by no means equally as serious everywhere in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the ratio of nurses to patients in intensive care units varies <e> <s> the other day when i was at the hammersmith hospital i saw six nurses round the bed of a child in intensive care <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i am trying to keep within the bounds of order and the subject of this particular question <e> <s> even with all the resources in the world regrettably one cannot conjure nurses out of thin air <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes very wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i have said that demand for services is boundless and as has also just been pointed out people are now receiving life-saving treatments that simply were not available even a few years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords for a number of reasons nurses are not coming forward in sufficient numbers to fill the extra places that are required owing to the expansion of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do so in such detail without notice although i agree with the noble baronesss introduction to her question <e> <s> what i can tell her is that there was an increase of per cent <e> <s> up to st march compared with the previous year <e>", "<cs> again my lords not without notice <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a question about that very interesting point i should be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as substitution is concerned this would have been totally impractical and i suggest wrong because quite rightly in the case of childrens nurses especially in intensive care students are not allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not normal practice to consult voluntary organisations generally on reports produced under the national health service scrutiny programme <e> <s> in this case however and the right reverend prelate will appreciate that it is a special case the appropriate voluntary providers and contractors were approached <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give the guarantees that the noble lord lord ennals asked for but i would expect that in some form this report will indeed be published <e> <s> we need to consider what if any advice to give authorities alongside the report <e> <s> until we have had our proper consideration it is not appropriate for me to give the guarantees for which the noble lord asked <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement that has been made in another place by my honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord ennals and lord winstanley for their reception of the statement <e> <s> the white paper which it introduces is a long and complicated one which sets the governments practical and comprehensive programme for primary health care for many years to come <e> <s> in passing let me say that the review process started by the green paper months ago was the first such review of that type of care for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid not <e> <s> i think charges for teeth were introduced by the government of which the noble lord lord ennals was a staunch supporter <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point pharmacists are to a great extent self-employed and to a great extent also they own their own premises <e> <s> therefore they are quite different from doctors in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but they are custom-built for a rather different kind of operation <e> <s> they are not what you might call shop-bound as opposed to being people-bound like community health centres <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding waiting lists or more importantly waiting times i most certainly agree with the noble lord <e> <s> we have had discussions in the house over recent weeks on the subject of the governments waiting list fund where special moneys have been given to health authorities which have shown that they can use funds wisely in order to reduce their waiting lists <e> <s> in the autumn statement the other day my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer announced that the second years money would be increased from million to million for the next financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a member of a government who do not actually believe that income tax ought to exist at all <e> <s> it was of course a temporary tax put on i believe by the duke of wellington <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised by my noble friend that it was prime minister pitt so it is even longer ago <e> <s> this temporary arrangement has gone on for far too long <e> <s> i believe that if one wants to raise taxes one can do it by other means such as value added tax <e> <s> i do not think on this particular aspect of health care taxes that would be the appropriate way to do it <e> <s> the government have decided that people should pay for services where they are able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the first half of my noble friends remarks <e> <s> i am not quite sure that i am as grateful for the second half <e> <s> the provision of dental services has led to considerable improvements in dental health in recent years <e> <s> for example in more than half of all five year-olds had no dental decay at all compared with under a third years earlier <e> <s> improvements have been felt by all age groups and the government therefore believe it is right to shift the emphasis from treatment to health promotion <e> <s> the government welcome the health authorities current flouridation initiatives and will continue to promote dental awareness and regular attendence at the dentist <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be unusually grateful to the noble viscount lord falkland for giving us the opportunity to debate a topic of concern on which there is quite rightly increasing public debate <e> <s> from what we have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy the noble lord lord dormand and others spoke eloquently on the subject of random breath-testing <e> <s> that has been a matter of considerable controversy for over years <e> <s> the noble lord lord dormand does not inhibit me from saying that the police may use their general powers under section of the road traffic act to stop vehicles at random in order to decide whether there are grounds for requiring a breath test under section of the act where there are reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords likeability is a matter of personal taste <e> <s> i shall not get into that argument at this moment <e> <s> perhaps i may mention <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> children in families receiving income support who are generally those in greatest need will continue to be entitled to free milk up to the age of five and to free school meals which may if the local authority so decides include milk <e> <s> for those who receive family credit after april their benefit will include a cash amount of per week per child in place of free milk for the under-fives and free school meals for the over-fives <e> <s> the actual cost of the milk which the cash replaces is <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a long debate on this subject and the noble baroness knows perfectly well that many more children in low income families will be receiving benefit than ever before as a result of our social security changes which take effect in april <e> <s> as regards the detailed question she asked around children in family income supplement and low income families will lose their entitlement to free milk but around children under five will receive the cash addition in family credit <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained exactly the position so far as free milk replacement schemes are concerned <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that there is really very little relevance to childrens nutritional welfare in housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness can ask but i am afraid that i do not have the answer <e> <s> i shall have to write to her on that specific point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that there is a certain relevance in that <e> <s> but really the amounts that i have described represent an increase in the amount of money going for childrens welfare in respect of milk <e>", "<cs> my lords the cash replacement is of course for those low income families who are already earning and who are well used to managing the budgets that they have through their earnings <e> <s> so i think that it is absolutely the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords if that amount of free milk provision is not being used then i suggest it is a total waste of public funds <e> <s> as regards the more important point of the noble lords question i am advised by my medical advisers that the special nutritional advantages of milk for very young children as compared with other foods reduce as the children get older so that by the time children are around five or older there is normally only limited nutritional advantage in milk rather than other types of food <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> nonetheless it is a fact that as i said the nutritional value of milk decreases as the child gets older and for those non-earning families free milk will continue to be available in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but local authorities will still be free to provide milk to children in income support families who are those in the greatest need where they consider this to be a requisite part of the free school meals <e>", "<cs> my lords over and above the success of the government in recent years in achieving lower rates of tax and rising real earnings the assessment of entitlement on the basis of net instead of gross income ends the absurd situation where loss of benefits combined with tax contributions leave someone worse off as gross pay rises <e> <s> seventy thousand families are presently in that position but they will not be after april of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> as i understand the position the changing of tax makes a very marginal difference to marginal tax rates <e> <s> should tax go to per cent <e> <s> the number of families on a rate of per cent <e> <s> and over would fall only from to <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of losing some pence is in fact minimal <e> <s> even if child benefit had been uprated the effect on the numbers receiving income-related benefits would be marginal <e> <s> perhaps fewer families would receive family credit and a further or so fewer families might receive housing benefit <e> <s> i suggest that this would hardly have a major impact on the numbers facing relatively high rates of benefit withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> the numbers in the per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> marginal tax rates bracket have in fact fallen from to <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest to the noble baroness that the very few families that are in the bracket to which she refers would in fact be very much worse off under the current system whereby it would actually cost them p in the pound to go to work <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards child benefit i have already answered a supplementary question on that fact <e> <s> as regards the tapers whether the housing benefit taper or the family credit taper we are actually talking about people who by going into employment earn a considerable amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that this has been the policy of the social democratic party for some time <e> <s> perhaps at first look it is rather tempting <e> <s> i must resist the temptation because serious issues clearly arise on how such merged systems could retain the contributory principle <e> <s> they might imply quite unacceptable increases in public expenditure and in the burden of taxation on earnings <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> whether it comes from the liberal party or the social democratic party i note that we are actually talking about uniformity of the tax and benefits system which does not seem to arise politically <e> <s> having said that i am well aware that my noble friend lord trafford for example and the noble baronesss honourable friend dr david owen were in consultation on this matter as long as years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of qualified nurses leaving the health service every year is i am advised substantially correct <e> <s> however that must be seen against the background of an increase in the total number of nurses of per cent <e> <s> over <e> <s> it is frequently claimed that one-third of student nurses fail to complete their training <e> <s> i am advised that that is not true <e> <s> in england the figure is per cent <e> <s> wastage <e> <s> i therefore do not

cannot conjure nurses out of thin air <e> <s> i accept that there are some shortages in some specialties <e> <s> there are also shortages in some geographical areas and london has a particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service has been given the freest reign in retaining nurses accommodation <e> <s> clearly we recognise that especially in areas of high-cost housing the ability to offer affordable residential accommodation of an acceptable standard is an extremely useful adjunct to recruitment and retention of staff <e> <s> we are therefore reviewing the availability of accommodation and the measures which might be taken to assist staff to enter the private housing market <e> <s> i am aware that some hospitals are currently revamping or building accommodation for nurses <e> <s> that will help to solve that particular problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am aware that some district health authorities have taken that step <e> <s> however when one is a manager in such circumstances which are very difficult indeed one has to balance the number of beds with the number of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i do not think that so long as nurses remain in this country the money is wasted <e> <s> it does not matter either to me or to my right honourable friend where nurses practise in this country so long as they do practise <e>", "<cs> having said that a study of the movement of nurses and nursing skills between the two sectors estimated that about nurses a year join the private sector from the national health service <e> <s> naturally nurses like anyone else are free to seek employment where they choose <e> <s> we do not intend to restrict that basic right <e> <s> however we are currently considering ways in which the private sectors contribution to the training of health care professionals can be expanded <e> <s> our aim is to increase the total number of skilled staff available both to the national health service and to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords it was this government who set up the nurses and midwives review body and who have accepted every one of the four recommendations which it has proposed since then <e> <s> that body will be reporting in about march of next year and we shall carefully consider what it says <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as pay is concerned my noble friend will understand that neither i nor my right honourable friend the prime minister can make any guarantees until the nurses and midwives review body has reported <e> <s> however i should point out that starting salaries for student nurses are considerably higher than student grants and that overall the real income of nurses has increased by per cent <e> <s> since in real terms it fell by per cent <e> <s> in the five years up to <e> <s> that demonstrates the governments commitment to maintaining nurses living standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not present to hear my noble friends answer as regards the severn barrage <e> <s> however there is absolutely no delay in the reports that i have mentioned <e> <s> the government will take the quickest action on their recommendations once these bodies have reported <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is trying to address two different problems <e> <s> what i am trying to address today is the problem of recruitment and retention of nurses and i do not believe that the hospital building programme has anything to do with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord speaks with more experience than i do on this particular matter <e> <s> however i am advised that some nurses leave the profession each year <e> <s> that figure includes over staff who are retiring and those who are leaving to have a family <e> <s> about return after breaking service and the balance is made up by the output of the training schools namely in <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that a very difficult question to answer <e> <s> as someone who did voluntary service overseas in a third world country i agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> as regards nursing recruitment from this country to places like australia and the united states i am afraid that i disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords by definition if closures are urgent of management grounds then there would not be time to consult on them <e> <s> having said that the circular to which the noble countess referred states that in cases of urgent temporary closure it is good practice for health authorities to consult on arrangements for the provision of interim services and re-opening <e> <s> as i said in my original answer that is the good practice which the central birmingham health authority is following <e>", "<cs> my lords this issue is not about cuts but about how fast services in particular expensive specialist services can grow <e> <s> this year central birminghams allocation has gone up by per cent <e> <s> in cash terms <e> <s> last year it was per cent <e> <s> altogether spending on health services in birmingham as a whole went up by per cent <e> <s> in real terms between and <e> <s> within this total of course difficult decisions have to be made about how fast individual services should grow but quite properly these decisions are for local resolution <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to put down a question on the total number of closures over the past months or whenever he should do so and i shall do my best to answer it but i am afraid i cannot do so at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go as far as that but i note that the central birmingham health authority has had three general managers in the past two years <e>", "<cs> my lords if they turn into <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord has any evidence on that point <e> <s> i have not seen the newspaper reports to which he refers <e> <s> if he has background for that comment i for one would certainly like to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to say that there must be a rationale for reaching decisions on clinical need and on resources <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that even in his time as a distinguished secretary of state for social services health authorities had to make ends meet year on year <e> <s> we find ourselves in that difficult position today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the region is considering the basis of the remarks made by the district chairman and that it is looking with great attention at what is technically known as the sub-regional rawp formula to see whether the central birmingham health authority has been under-funded <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree with the second part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> i have not heard suggestions that community health councils are being devalued by district and regional authorities <e> <s> i hope that that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords while i shall accede to the request of the noble lord the leader of the opposition to refer your lordships comments on this subject and any others to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services i hope that he is not suggesting that i have been inaccurate in my answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble countess for producing to me a few minutes ago the details on which she based her supplementary questions and for all i know her original question on the order paper <e> <s> as i understand the position at that moment there was a proposal <e> <s> it was not in the words of one noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a shortage of nursing staff caring for mentally ill people in some district health authorities although nationally the total number of such staff increased by per cent <e> <s> to man years between september and september <e> <s> this rise is made up of a per cent <e> <s> increase in hospital psychiatric nursing staff and compares with a fall of per cent <e> <s> in in-patients between years ending december and december and a rise of per cent <e> <s> in community psychiatric nursing staff <e> <s> during this period the proportion of qualified staff has increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> obviously i accept that not all the staff were available in the places where the need arose <e> <s> i have seen the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords from what i can remember that is a very free translation of what i <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree <e> <s> that is why i said in answer to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs that first i should like to see a considerable increase in community psychiatric nurses <e> <s> secondly we are investigating the whole area of community care <e> <s> we expect sir roy griffiths who is the secretary of states adviser on the health service to report very early in the new year <e> <s> we shall be able to take decisions based on that report <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as i said in answer to a supplementary of my noble friend lady cox last week the government are indeed taking on board considerations for major moves in this area <e> <s> i am afraid i have nothing to announce today <e>", "<cs> my lords again we are getting very wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however i dealt fairly fully with this question last <e>", "<cs> my lords again i answered a supplementary question posed by my noble friend lord elton on this subject last week <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i certainly agree with that <e> <s> but there is a world of difference between this question on psychiatric treatment and the more general problems to which my noble friend has certainly some of the solutions and which we have discussed on numerous occasions in recent weeks in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to explain earlier <e> <s> i am as keen as anyone to extend the numbers of community psychiatric nurses <e> <s> it sounds to me as though buckinghamshire has been able to achieve it <e> <s> yes i should like to see that duplicated widely <e>", "<cs> my lords we are familiar with important and wide-ranging debates in your lordships house but this debate has been exceptionally wide ranging encompassing not only the broad field of social security in all its ramifications but also its many variations in the nations of the european community and possible developments well into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and the noble baroness for their reception of the order <e> <s> i was asked why the problem was not foreseen <e> <s> it was foreseen <e> <s> i was not around at the time of your lordships discussions of the social security bill in and but i understand that this matter was referred to then by my noble predecessor <e> <s> i too regret that we could not encompass this order with the orders we debated the other night <e> <s> unfortunately as i understand the matter there were drafting problems because it could quite easily have been subsumed that is rather a useful word for this evening into the housing benefit regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her introductory comments <e> <s> breast cancers that are detected early are likely to have the best chance of a successful cure and to require less radical forms of treatment <e> <s> it is best clinical practice for any woman needing treatment to be informed of the possible options but i note that even when less radical treatment is offered research has shown that about half the women choose a mastectomy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to think about the question of the noble baroness on guidelines <e> <s> as regards back-up each regional health authority has been allocated one-third of a million pounds to set up its first screening centre for a population of about half a million <e> <s> this was intended to meet the costs not only of screening but also of assessment diagnosis and treatment <e> <s> four of these centres have also been funded to provide training for staff for the whole programme <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an identifiable part of the general health budget for this year <e> <s> workplace screening can be very effective but it will need to be set up in conjunction with the national health service system to ensure that if abnormalities are found the necessary follow-up is available and to avoid confusion with the call and recall system <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> this is why i said that we had also funded four centres to provide training for staff for the whole programme <e> <s> i certainly agree with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments plans as i think i made clear earlier include provision to meet the full continuing estimated costs of the remaining centres to be set up in and <e> <s> judging by the reported state of the health service at the moment i do not think that regional health authorities will have any difficulty in spending this years money <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter from the birmingham consultants to the chairman of the regional health authority is clearly an expression of concern for the difficulties facing the district health authorities which have become apparent over recent months <e> <s> however health services in birmingham have continued to expand despite the acknowledged pressures upon them <e>", "<cs> no my lords i certainly do not think that a royal commission or an inquiry should i say another inquiry into the management of the health service is appropriate <e> <s> i would make the point that this year the west midlands region is getting a cash increase of per cent <e> <s> taking its total resource allocation to over billion and a per cent <e> <s> real terms increase from <e> <s> as i have said on numerous occasions health authorities have the legal obligation to live within their means which involves on occasions making very difficult choices <e> <s> this is what is happening at the moment in birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords if the health service was in as parlous a state as the noble lord suggests from the evidence which i agree has been coming from the heads of the three royal colleges from the bma and all sorts of sources within the health service i would find it extremely difficult to reconcile that with the fact that so many more patient treatments continue to be made year after year <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> of course that is not what i am saying <e> <s> that is not at all what i said <e> <s> i said that while recognising the concerns that have been expressed from all these organisations one must realise also that continuing to spend extra money which is in an unallocated form cannot be the sole answer to the very intractable problems which we all know exist in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are spending a little more money to use the noble lords phrase <e> <s> an extra million is being made available for hospital services next year out of a total of billion extra money for health <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals who i know is wanting to ask a supplementary question faced exactly the same difficulties when he was secretary of state for social services <e> <s> the fact that money continues to be made available for the health service and will continue to be made available in increasing amounts for the health service does not mean that the intractable problems of the health service will disappear just because of that extra money <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the last point <e> <s> first statistics are not tired as the noble lord suggests secondly most certainly they show that extra treatments are continually being provided often in excess of the amount of money that is provided <e> <s> i accept that difficult decisions must be made <e> <s> that means not only the government seeing whether extra money can be made available in whatever amount at whatever time <e> <s> it also means that for that money we must see that we have proper control of the health service by the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i find equally anomalous the fact that labour ministers managed to have disputes with the nurses in with junior doctors in and with doctors and the royal colleges in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to judge government policy on polls that is entirely up to him however i observe that when asked specifically are you prepared for a reduction in your take-home pay in order to find extra money for the health service <e> <s> only per cent <e> <s> of the respondents in a recent poll said yes <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it has and returning to the question <e> <s> i should like to add even in birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords if up to you means reporting to the government via myself then the message has most certainly gone home <e> <s> the extra allocation for regional health authorities will be made shortly but as i have said repeatedly i do not think that that will solve the particular problems <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from memory approximately per cent <e> <s> extra funding has been made available in real terms since <e> <s> i told the house recently that that resulted in an increase of per cent <e> <s> in hospitalised boarding treatments a per cent <e> <s> increase in day patient cases and a per cent <e> <s> increase in other ways <e>", "<cs> my lords this year the government spent approximately billion on the health service as a whole and that amount will be increased next year and the year following <e> <s> i do not call that going without money <e> <s> however i take the point that should a sensible arrangement be made for spending extra money we must obtain value for that money <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is right expensive machinery which now goes into health care is a factor in the equation <e> <s> so also is the fact that for example there are more nurses in this country per of the population than there are for example in the united states of america or germany <e>", "<cs> my lords clincial practice always changes over time <e> <s> i am not able to accept the fact that because today patients stay for a shorter time in hospital than five or years ago one can draw conclusions from that as regards the state of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i had better refer the noble baroness to the answer i gave to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the departments activities in this area are concerned it normally only becomes involved first on the general oversight of mental illness hospitals and secondly when it is planned to close such a hospital <e> <s> as far as care in the community goes we make it crystal clear to regional health authorities and indeed to the districts that hospitals that are moving patients out into the community should do so only when alternative sources of provision whether day centres or whatever are there <e>", "<cs> my lords this all depends on what you call a hospital <e> <s> it is quite clear that some patients who have been long-term residents in the large mental hospitals such as we are addressing in this question go into smaller more local residential units <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures on the countrywide position but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there should be no time lag <e> <s> extra money has been provided for the social services departments of health and local authorities to undertake care in the community <e> <s> we are watching that situation with care <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a misguided view if i may be allowed to say so <e> <s> as i pointed out to the noble lord lord winstanley many of the patients who come from long-stay hospitals move into residential accommodation which is staffed by wardens and others involved in the care of the ex-patients <e> <s> many patients in friern barnet hospital are there for short stays and are at liberty to discharge themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is for that reason that the government have asked sir roy griffiths to inquire into the whole situation of community care <e> <s> as regards advising patients in good time where the hospital has decided to discharge a patient it will be necessary to inform the patient and the local authoritys social services department so that provision can be made and the patients prepared in the correct way for exit into the community <e> <s> however there are long-term plans for closing the hospital is currently the suggested date <e> <s> i do not think that it would be right to begin preparing patients now for what will be a clinical judgment of the doctor concerned much nearer the time of discharge <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent years we have had many reappraisals of the national health service the most recent being that conducted by sir roy griffiths <e> <s> i do not think that it would be productive to have yet another total upheaval of the national health service at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision as regards publication has yet been made <e> <s> ministers expect to receive the report next month <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement that has been made in another place on allocations to health authorities <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement although it was rather muted in the case of the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i shall try to answer as many as possible of the questions i have been asked <e> <s> both noble lords referred to the million for the next financial year <e> <s> i can confirm that the million for aids for the regions which are most affected by this particular and unfortunate scourge is in effect top-sliced from that million <e> <s> so yes that reduces the amount for general distribution as indeed does the million in the special fund which goes towards those inner city regions which are dramatic losers because of the redistributional effects of the rawp formula <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to say that in million patient treatments were carried out <e> <s> more will be carried out in <e> <s> as a result of the figures that i have been able to announce to your lordships today even more will be carried out in <e> <s> the financial management of the economy is exactly why we can afford to spend those record amounts of money and get those record numbers of patient treatments <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i listen with great respect to the noble lord <e> <s> as far as administration is concerned i know that some per cent <e> <s> is spent on administration in the national health service <e> <s> any large business in the <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the million is the result of special circumstances which health authorities face this year concerning which your lordships have been advising me for the last few months <e> <s> as far as the allocation of the extra money is concerned i think it will be helpful to the house if i put that information in the library <e> <s> it is extremely complicated <e> <s> the short answer to the noble lords question is that the money will be allocated as revenue allocations are made now <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is done on the basis of existing allocations for this financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall make a list available in the library concerning the -odd major projects <e> <s> certainly casualty departments are included <e> <s> so far as nurses pay is concerned i made the point to your lordships the other day that this government had set up the nurses and midwives salary review body and had accepted every one of its four recommendations <e> <s> that is not to say that i <e>", "<cs> my lords i must reject the underlying theology of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> it takes a phenomenally long time for the government to wring money first out of the taxpayers pocket and secondly out of themselves <e> <s> although this statement may come as a surprise to your lordships to my certain knowledge we have been working on it for some time <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that it is the most vital matter <e> <s> what matters to everybody is the number of beds <e> <s> whether they are in a whole ward or scattered through a hospital is not particularly pertinent <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly no intention to interfere with the clinical judgment of the doctors whether in manipulative therapy or in any other way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to get into an argument with the noble lord over cabinet government because as i understand the matter he has been a member of a cabinet and i have not <e> <s> however as he will know even better than i it takes a long time for matters even to reach the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been at great pains over recent weeks to explain that the needs of the health service are infinite <e> <s> it may be extremely difficult to answer the noble lords question but if it is possible to find an answer i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords any organisation always wants more from the bank <e> <s> it is a salutary experience not to receive the full amount from ones bank because it means that one has to try harder <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the manufacturer stopped selling and distributing this device in the united kingdom in july immediately after similar action had been taken in the united states pending investigations into its safety by the us food and drug administration following reports of problems <e> <s> so far as i am aware the fda did not ask for the device to be recalled as a result of its investigations <e> <s> the manufacturers wrote to all doctors about the dalkon shield in and <e> <s> furthermore it is good practice for doctors to carry out regular follow-up checks on patients fitted with iuds of any kind <e> <s> that advice is <e>",

worldwide publicity campaign to invite claims and their action resulted in considerable media coverage <e> <s> i have made that point clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not yet sure that justice will not be forthcoming since the noble lord has already accepted that women from the united kingdom were included in the claims <e> <s> he has mentioned other women who were not included in the claims <e> <s> if that is true then obviously i shall have to take the matter further <e> <s> however i should point out that the position of the government on compensation for medical accidents generally is well known and follows the advice of the pearson commission which concluded that negligence should continue to be the basis for liability for most medical injuries <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a vast range of intrauterine devices currently available some of which are made in this country and others abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to todays debate i have been reminded with a slightly sinking heart of a very wise comment made by the noble lady lady saltoun in the original debate in your lordships house on the warnock report <e> <s> she said <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet started drafting the proposed legislation but as the white paper makes clear there is as yet no <e>", "<cs> my lords i checked with the district health authority this morning and my figures are somewhat different from those of the noble countess <e> <s> i understand that radiotherapy and oncology beds out of a total of available beds at the queen elizabeth hospital were temporarily closed in september <e> <s> the bed closures were urgent temporary closures and health authorities are not obliged to consult over closures of this kind <e> <s> however i confirm that central birmingham will be receiving from the extra million which was announced for distribution to the english health authorities in december <e> <s> it will be for that district health authority to allocate the money where it feels it will be best used <e>", "<cs> my lords if the hospital which the noble lord mentioned was in the west midlands regional health authority area i would <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at my original answer i said that what was important was that the west midlands regional health authority should have an overall provision for cancer patients <e> <s> this is what it has got <e> <s> i accept that it is overloaded in one particular place namely the queen elizabeth hospital which is why it is intended to transfer some patients to other hospitals offering this specialty in the region <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the question that the noble lord specifically asked me to address is concerned i have no reason to suppose that it is inadequate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is a specific responsibility as the noble lord knows well <e> <s> this responsibility even in his time was devolved through regions to districts and that is exactly what is going on now <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend not for the first time is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge and belief the circular is still effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my opening remarks this is a short bill but it is wide-ranging <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger described the bill as a gallimaufry <e> <s> i must confess that i could not spell the word gallimaufry and so i looked it up in the dictionary <e> <s> one definition is that it is a heterogeneous or in other words a diverse matter <e> <s> i certainly agree with her on that point <e> <s> i rather suspect that it is the last point on which i shall agree with the noble baroness on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble countess can hold that view if she wishes but i have already spoken for minutes and it would probably take me another seven minutes to respond to the various points on the social fund which we have accepted is a discrete subject <e> <s> therefore as i said at the beginning i should prefer to respond to all the points globally by letter to make sure that they are properly answered rather than give a gabbled and garbled response which i am frightened of doing at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear to my noble friend and to the house that there is absolutely no question of applicants being pushed from pillar to post <e> <s> the advice to people is to go to the social fund officer in the local social security office <e> <s> he will make a crisis loan payment if appropriate <e> <s> only if a suitable local charity exists which as i have said has the money or service available would he advise the applicant to seek help there for no other reason <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a possibility which is always in the forefront of the minds of noble lords opposite <e> <s> as i have made quite clear there is no question of expecting charities to subsidise the state in this way <e> <s> only if a suitable local charity exists which has the money or service available will it be an appropriate source of help <e>", "<cs> my lords this confusion probably exists because it is not generally realised that crisis loans are available to any member of the public not just to those on benefit <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to have regard to all possible methods of repayment <e> <s> in some cases i accept by no means all a credit card may be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already explained that we are talking not only about the poor and those on benefits <e> <s> the loans are available to any member of your lordships house and to any member of the public therefore an appropriate means of repayment has to be ascertained in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords relatives means immediate relatives and certainly not aged aunts <e> <s> what is important to realise is that when an application is made there will be an interview by the social fund officer of the applicant <e> <s> one of the questions that will be asked at the interview is whether the applicant has access to other funds from his or her immediate relatives <e> <s> if the answer is no and only the applicant can answer that question the subject will be dropped <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on how far away they live <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that a dickensian manner would apply to organisations such as the aberfan disaster fund <e> <s> the charity involved would depend upon the circumstances <e> <s> one obvious possibility is where a disaster fund is already in existence to meet claims arising from a particular tragedy <e> <s> there are sometimes local charities which provide grants or services to people in need <e> <s> for example if there is a flood in buckinghamshire and the local wrvs is providing blankets there seems to be little point in the social fund making duplicate provision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount was good enough to inform me earlier about the length of delay for this specialty in the guildford area which is considerably worse than the last year for which i have figures regarding the time between people being seen and diagnosed as needing a hip replacement and their admission for treatment <e> <s> the average in was weeks in england <e> <s> i regret that i do not have more up-to-date figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the facts in front of me <e> <s> but judging from memory my father considered having the operation in the early s and was told that he would have to wait at least until the late s before he would be able to have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i seem to remember that the professor also operated at haslemere hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly one of the points at which we shall need to look <e> <s> but returning to hip operations the objective is that by there will be such operations carried out per million of the population <e> <s> we intend that some will take place each year by that time <e> <s> it looks as though we are on stream towards achieving that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the case just referred to by my noble friend <e> <s> as i said the figure of weeks in england in was an average figure <e> <s> it is vital that general practitioners have the information so that we can have an average waiting list for the various specialties across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> that is why first of all hip operations are one of the series of operations which are countenanced for extra funds under the waiting list initiative <e> <s> secondly that is why <e>", "<cs> my lords not so far as concerns orthopaedics <e> <s> an additional nine posts will be implemented by the end of the current financial year a further six by the end of one post the following year and one by <e> <s> that gives an additional posts <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about the district within which the general practitioner operates <e> <s> there is certainly discussion going on through the offices of the district health authorities concerning the point that there should he an opportunity for referring to different districts <e> <s> however that has not yet come to fruition <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree that they most certainly do have a very heavy burden in the work which they do <e> <s> i observe that the panel of inquiry into the death of jasmine beckford chaired by mr louis blom-cooper recommended that nothing short of a period of three years was required for the professional training of social workers <e> <s> that is one of the factors which the government are taking into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with those remarks <e> <s> that is why the council published proposals for reforming social work training in its publication <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point on which i should not like to give an answer off-the-cuff <e> <s> of course we are well aware of the views of the trainers themselves both in universities and in polytechnics as well as in other places of training <e> <s> all those matters would need to be taken into account before the government publish their response <e>", "<cs> my lords that may or may not be true but they have not yet been agreed by the government who of course would have to pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very dangerous supposition <e> <s> there will always be in the best regulated of societies things that go wrong <e> <s> therefore inquiries will continue to be needed <e> <s> whether they would have needed to have been undertaken in such depth and with such severity as we have seen in those three cases i really cannot tell <e>", "<cs> my lords the government give strong encouragement to the donation of cadaveric organs for transplantation <e> <s> our policy is formulated within the framework of the human tissue act which is based on the principle that organ donation is a voluntary act of generosity <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first supplementary question the suggestion is that fewer than half of such organs are removed when the individuals are not medically dead <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not know the answer <e> <s> however the government believe that the use of organs from living donors should be restricted and where possible gradually eliminated <e> <s> in all cases there must be clear evidence that the consent of the donor has been freely given and is not motivated by financial considerations <e> <s> in addition relatives should approve of such a donation <e>", "<cs> my lords a major campaign to promote the organ donor card was launched in <e> <s> national organisations have been persuaded to mount campaigns <e> <s> the department is currently co-operating with british telecom in a scheme to include organ donor cards with all telephone bills in the london area <e> <s> in the department distributed about million donor cards <e>", "<cs> my lords the fitness or otherwise of the organs of the noble lord would depend on a clinical judgment made by the doctor concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the first question asked by the noble lord is exactly the same <e> <s> even if i misunderstood the question that was first asked i still do not know the answer <e> <s> as regards the second question the government believe that medical staff in the united kingdom would in practice always wish to approach relatives before removing organs even if the law did not require them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge and belief the government have not commented on the report to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> we believe that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions <e> <s> evidence from the united states which implemented such legislation in shows what i can only describe as mixed results <e> <s> we are uncertain whether the american experience will be repeated if similar legislation is enacted in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i encourage all members of your lordships house to carry a donor card <e>", "<cs> my lords i mean exactly that <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the relevant figures for salaries and wages for hospitals are not collected centrally <e> <s> however the relevant figures in the united kingdom hospital and community health services in were per cent <e> <s> for medical staff per cent <e> <s> for administrative staff and per cent <e> <s> for ancillary staff <e>", "<cs> indeed it would my lords <e> <s> that is the reason why in the past six years there has been a reduction in for example the number of ancillary workers amounting to something over <e> <s> that is the result of management action on manpower levels and the introduction of competitive tendering <e> <s> the money saved in that way has gone directly into patient care <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord refers to the total amount of gross domestic product from both private and public sources i do not believe that there is much difference between the countries in europe <e> <s> if the noble lord is speaking only of the state provision then i agree that there is sometimes a large difference <e> <s> however the objective is for the state to pay for the amount of medical care which it believes can be justified by the economy of the country concerned <e> <s> i believe that that is what we have done over the past six years <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> in terms of gross turnover i confirm the figure which i have used before <e> <s> five per cent <e> <s> is spent on administration and management <e> <s> i am not able to confirm whether that figure would be higher or lower with a partially or totally private insurance-based medical service <e>", "<cs> my lords in a nutshell my reply meant that it is extremely difficult to make the kind of comparisons which the noble lord was asking me to make <e>", "<cs> my lords one enormous group would of course be the nurses <e> <s> another would be the professional and technical services such as laboratory services <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that very difficult to believe when per cent <e> <s> of all employees in the health service are nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the view as did my predecessor that the details of the scheme are very much a matter for the profession <e> <s> the outcome of the first election is evidence that the scheme is workable and can produce satisfactory results <e> <s> there has been co-operation and goodwill between the ukcc and the boards in the development of the scheme <e> <s> i am not aware of any particular antagonism towards the election scheme from the profession <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> so far as concerns the structure of the health service we now have nine supra-regional centres for cardiac operations which are funded directly by the department <e> <s> that means that we are able to put money directly where the care is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords in my position one can hardly fail to be aware that there is a great deal of discussion going on in this country at the moment as to the future organisation and funding of the nhs <e> <s> an internal ministerial review is being conducted <e> <s> any opinions which your lordships express will be most gratefully received <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not have that information <e> <s> if it is possible to obtain it i shall write to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it has already been pointed out to the house this afternoon that we are conducting specialist operations on babies which could not have been conducted at all many years ago <e> <s> as regards babies who have the operation or who are in the queue as the noble lord puts it we have no evidence that delays are causing deaths <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i can do no better than to send him a copy of the letter which i shall if possible be sending to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> regarding the second part of his question i accept as i have on several occasions in your lordships house that there is a lack of intensive care paediatric nurses in particular <e> <s> the government are seeking to deal with that matter in various ways <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we all want the situation to be improved but i do not think that that is the point <e> <s> to pick an obvious recent example in the case of david barber the coroner said that david died of natural causes and that a lack of nursing staff or the delay in his operation were not factors in his death <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right and underlines the point that i tried to explain to the house in my first answer to the noble lord lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords not to my knowledge but i am aware that in the west midlands regional health authority there is a new course for paediatric nurses which is expected to start in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have consistently made clear they are determined that this very small group of people who will become severely disabled after th april will not be disadvantaged as a result of the social security reforms <e> <s> work is continuing with the help of the voluntary sector on an interim scheme to assist them to live independently <e> <s> details will be announced at the earliest opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised two very different points <e> <s> i can confirm that if there is a break in the benefit of longer than eight weeks a new benefit rate will pertain <e> <s> however if it is shorter than that the old benefit rate will be reinstated <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly there is need for a long-term solution <e> <s> i would not disagree with the noble baroness on that <e> <s> we are determined to get a long-term solution but this cannot be achieved until we have the results of the opcs study on the nature and scale of severe disability and can couple it with sir roy griffithss report on his overview of care in the community <e> <s> what we need now of course is a temporary scheme <e> <s> i do not know when or whether your lordships will pass the social security bill but i suspect that it will not happen speedily enough <e> <s> having said that why do we not introduce legislation on this point <e> <s> we have been advised that we have the existing powers and therefore that we do not need to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords that has been considered in the past and rejected <e> <s> there are already two premia for disabled persons and since one of the main aims of the new scheme is simplification i do not think that adding another premium would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware the disability organisations have not declined to take part in this scheme <e> <s> as regards reactions to the white paper it was a little previous i suggest to react to the document when details of the scheme were not contained in it <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were seeking to neglect them we should not be endeavouring with great urgency to find a scheme to help them <e> <s> i must point out that these people do not yet exist <e> <s> we are talking about those newly disabled after th april <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord kilmarnock for initiating this debate <e> <s> not only is the subject of aids an immensely important one as borne out by the speeches of noble lords but the debate is also timely coming as it does only a few days after the world summit of ministers of health on programmes for aids prevention <e> <s> the noble lord has drawn particular attention to this historic summit and i shall return to it later in my remarks <e> <s> but first i would like to turn to the other aspect of the motion before us which is the governments response to the report on aids of the social services committee in another place <e>", "<cs> it was amended by a government amendment <e> <s> irrespective of the argument about whether local authorities are suitable bodies to carry out health education i am well aware that discussion on that matter is going on up and down the country i gently suggest to the noble lords lord ennals and lord kilmarnock that they take another look at clause of the bill which says firmly clearly and shortly that <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think that one can draw that conclusion from what i have said <e> <s> however i shall look again at what i have said and perhaps i may write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords every endeavour is made by health authorities to meet those guidelines <e> <s> indeed we are constantly looking at them to see whether such matters can be improved <e> <s> however it should be pointed out that demand for health care is totally uncontrolled <e> <s> it is true that a number of districts are having difficulty remaining within their budgets this year <e> <s> it should be remembered that managers are responsible for health authorities keeping within the law and although they plan their district finances very carefully they do not control the clinical decisions which determine the level of expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the second half of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> the endeavours of the staff have been very praiseworthy indeed <e> <s> i do not believe that anyone is being punished in the way that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> what has happened is that staff particularly in london have not been available for extra beds made available at the beginning of the financial year <e> <s> that is why we have reached the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords that may or may not be true but i still do not believe that it is an appropriate word <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the budget he knows as well as i do that this is not an appropriate moment to comment on what may or may not be contained in my right honourable friends budget statement <e> <s> having said that the decisions on what to pay for have already been made <e> <s> the budget tells us how to pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept that there are many differing aspects to what is widely described as the health service problem which principally exists within the acute services <e> <s> it is because there are so many different aspects to it that an inquisition is being undertaken <e>", "<cs> most certainly not my lords <e> <s> as i said in the house i believe in answer to a supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord ennals the other day any thoughts that can be given by your lordships the professional bodies or anyone else will be well received by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that there are no centrally collected facts and figures for such closures or the reasons for them <e> <s> i pointed out that financial reasons are not the only criteria for temporary closures <e>", "<cs> my lords it never has been and the arrangements within the nhs currently and during the time of the noble lord lord ennals do not enable such figures to be collected <e>", "<cs> my lords if that were so i wish the noble countess would tell me <e>", "<cs> my lords riverside health authority is consulting formally on a proposal to build a new westminster and chelsea hospital on the site of st stephens hospital fulham <e> <s> the consultation paper shows that if a new hospital were to be built as is proposed other hospitals in the district including the westminster on its present site and westminster childrens hospital would close <e> <s> a decision on such a project would be taken only after thorough consideration of the implications for patients and assessment of the financial and other aspects of the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly as i have said ministers have to approve the financial aspects of the scheme as a whole <e> <s> it would be impossible in fact it would not be impossible but improper to do that without recognising the considerations such as the effect on patients the cost and benefits how the scheme would be funded and whether it would give good value for money <e> <s> those are the kinds of issues that the noble lord lord ennals is interested in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly confused but i believe my noble friend is talking about the clinical grading review of trained or untrained nurses in our hospitals <e> <s> so far as i know that is not directly related to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if by westminster the noble lord means the houses of parliament quite clearly arrangements both for emergency and primary health care treatment of members of your lordships house and those of another place would be a most important factor in reaching any decision in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord means more widely then clearly it is necessary to consider the effect on patients as i have said <e> <s> by that i mean all patients in the riverside health authority area <e>", "<cs> my lords any of the sites mentioned in the scheme have quite a high potential cash value <e> <s> it will be necessary to consider the whole scheme and the financial aspects of it all at the same time <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot give the kind of guarantee for which the noble lord is asking <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already clarified that matter <e> <s> however it is equally obvious to me that financial considerations will have to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i am aware of that but i find this a difficult issue and i must be careful not to pre-judge this particular investigation <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that work must be carried out in a particular geographical area <e>", "<cs> my lords although that question does not have a great deal to do with the question on the order paper i think that the official answer to my noble friend is that nothing is sacred <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of that matter <e> <s> transport is one of the issues at which my right honourable friends look with particular interest when deciding whether to approve or disapprove potential closures <e>", "<cs> my lords the district health authority has issued a consultation paper to the community health council which is still deliberating on it <e>", "<cs> my lords having lived and worked in the area for some time i suggest that if patients are using their personal transport the car parking facilities where they now exist are far from adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had already dealt with public transport in answer to the supplementary question asked by the noble baroness lady masham <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for bringing the matter to my attention <e> <s> before he sent me details of his question i was unaware of this situation <e> <s> i am advised that the current position is that all new projects are on hold <e> <s> in the autumn my right honourable friend the secretary of state met regional health authority chairmen and asked them to provide details of all their projects to establish homes and hostels for former patients <e> <s> once we have the information and are able to assess the position we can decide what steps to take <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essential that proper provision is made in the community before patients are discharged whether through nurses doctors health workers or anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord renton for asking that supplementary question <e> <s> when my noble friend lord jenkin made that statement he also made it <e>", "<cs> my lords a considerable amount of money is allowed to local authorities to spend on community care and personal social services <e> <s> we have studied the report of the audit commission with great care and as part of the evidence we referred it to sir roy griffiths so that he can take it into account when presenting his report <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not realised that my departments attention was drawn to this matter before <e> <s> certainly my attention has not been drawn to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the general view is not likely to be as detailed as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> however the general points made in your lordships house as a result of this question will indeed be taken into account in consideration of sir roy griffiths review <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we have never made any secret of our feeling that care in the community is anything but cheap <e> <s> nonetheless we believe it provides the right conditions for most mentally handicapped people and of course the main burden of financing this care will continue to fall on public authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of that concern <e> <s> i do not have the figures on the proportion that have been moved out into the community <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> it is certainly my intention to do that <e> <s> i should point out that health authorities are not able to make a charge and that is the crux of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand sir roy is in the final stages of his work and hopes to present his report very shortly <e> <s> we will give consideration to publication at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that sir roys report is due to be received very shortly <e> <s> it may appear that there has been some delay but this has turned out to be a much bigger exercise than sir roy first thought <e> <s> however the delay is not serious and as i said he is now in the final stages of preparing the report <e>", "<cs> my lords voluntary bodies and others have of course contributed to the evidence that sir roy has received <e> <s> it would be unusual to say the least if the government decided to act on sir roys report by way of legislation or anything else if the voluntary bodies were not consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be equally extraordinary for any government to give a commitment to publication in advance of the receipt of such a report <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see how i or any of my right honourable or honourable friends in another place can be accused of secrecy when we have not even seen the report <e>", "<cs> my lords those considerations would depend entirely on what is in the report <e> <s> as i keep stressing we have not seen the report <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always gratifying to know that other people are put in the same position as the house has put me in this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose was so that the government could have an inquiry <e> <s> the government therefore asked a responsible member <e>", "<cs> my lords there is absolutely nothing to stop them <e> <s> the evidence that sir roy received is so far as i am aware widely available from the bodies who gave him that evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords all sorts of people may or may not be consulted <e> <s> i am not aware that any particular member of the government will or will not be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> anybody listening to the exchanges in the house today could not fail to be aware of the great interest in sir roys work and the concern that it should receive early publication <e> <s> we shall certainly take due account of that when we receive the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe it gives credence to anything of the sort <e> <s> i am well aware that there have been all kinds of supposition in the media as to what the report may contain <e> <s> i can neither confirm nor deny these as i stress yet again that i have not see it <e>", "<cs> in introducing the amendment the noble lord lord ennals talked about clearing up anomalies in this clause <e> <s> there are several amendments which in his view will achieve that particular end <e> <s> as i made clear at second reading this is exactly what the whole clause is intended to do <e> <s> if i may say so to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter he has it in one <e>", "<cs> i shall of course look carefully at the <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the arguments put forward in support of these amendments <e> <s> did i understand that the noble baroness lady turner was also referring to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> i am not surprised that the noble lord and the noble baroness have put down these three amendments <e> <s> however as i made clear just now the only purpose of this clause is clarification and confirmation <e> <s> these amendments will go considerably wider and i think it will come as no surprise when i say that i cannot advise the committee to accept them <e>", "<cs> when we originally came to consider the bill as drafted our problem was that it does not have a section bb either below or above and therefore the reference in question was quite inappropriate <e> <s> so far as concerns the act sub-paragraph bb is an amendment to section which says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for his amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said it contains a nugget which we may or may not be able to develop <e> <s> at the moment i have a slight difficulty in that i am not sure whether or not it is the right nugget <e>", "<cs> perhaps the word review should not be used in committee as it has rather different connotations at present <e>", "<cs> i regret that i cannot find even a nugget in the amendment <e> <s> apart from anything else it seems to go very wide <e> <s> the disregard that the <e>", "<cs> as i suspect the noble lord will know although traditionally home helps have carried out domestic duties their functions have moved progressively towards personal care <e> <s> personal care assistants would be expected to carry out duties which would include assistance with bodily functions as defined for attendance allowance purposes <e> <s> to take a few at random breathing maintaining bodily temperature vision speech hearing and sleep would be pertinent in this case <e>", "<cs> i must take issue with the noble baroness lady phillips and remind her of what i said earlier today to the noble lord lord banks on the subject of saving money by the clause <e> <s> the amount of money saved is less than million is therefore quite minimal and is not the reason why the government have introduced the clause <e>", "<cs> this amendment covers two quite distinct areas <e> <s> first it seeks to impose a time limit on the independent adjudication authorities responsible for deciding entitlement to attendance allowance <e> <s> we have heard arguments from both sides of the committee as to whether that is good or bad at various times of the year or generally speaking <e> <s> it then goes on to subject the decisions of the attendance allowance board the independent authority responsible for deciding whether the medical entitlement conditions are satisfied in individual cases to a right of appeal to a social security appeal tribunal <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady turner has laid this issue squarely on the line namely do we favour putting back the law to where it was before or do we believe that the <e>", "<cs> and i shall therefore have to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i find myself in some difficulty over the amendment especially as one of the premises produced by the noble baroness lady turner was that the government do not like the industrial injuries scheme <e> <s> i assure the committee that that is not so <e> <s> broadly speaking reduced earnings allowances are paid as compensation for lost earnings arising from industrial disablement <e> <s> the allowance is not intended to compensate for the disablement itself and never in all its previous guises since has it done so <e>", "<cs> the eagle eye of the noble baroness has struck again <e> <s> i am afraid i have not the least idea of the answer to her question <e>

spoken in its favour and especially my noble friend sitting behind me <e> <s> i recognise the strength of their feelings and their commitment to the cause of families <e> <s> nevertheless i have to invite the committee not to approve the amendment <e> <s> that is not because we in any way disagree about the importance of improving the help available to families <e> <s> quite the contrary is the case <e> <s> although we are not proposing to increase child benefit next april we are putting far more than what that would have cost into extra help for families <e>", "<cs> i did not say that those words were intended to reflect the position that i explained to the committee earlier <e> <s> what i intended to say was that they could equally well be given that explanation as the explanation given the committee by the noble <e>", "<cs> the speeches of the noble countess lady mar and the noble lord lord ennals would have enormous force if we were proposing to do away with child benefit altogether but we are not <e> <s> i return to the question what effect does pence a week have <e> <s> for those in impoverished circumstances it may have a great effect but it is more than made up by the benefits especially family credit to which i alluded earlier <e> <s> for many people in the circumstances in which the noble countess now finds herself i suggest that pence is very little indeed

counter to our long-standing proposals to ally the benefits paid to industrial widows to those paid to national insurance widows <e> <s> the noble baroness will not be surprised therefore that i cannot recommend the committee to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is the right for the opposition to be suspicious <e> <s> i remember sitting on those benches some time ago and being equally suspicious of the government of the day <e> <s> however i have to say that there is no reason for suspicion of ogreism if that is a word in the english language on this occasion <e>", "<cs> there are three quite major issues here <e> <s> first having regard to specific outgoings in this way would change the nature of the family credit scheme <e> <s> that scheme is designed to be quite broad-brush and therefore simple to administer <e> <s> this enables us to deal with claims entirely by post and at a central office <e> <s> like family income supplement at present family credit has no regard to specific outgoings and certainly a need to investigate reasonableness and whether an expense was necessarily incurred as this amendment would demand would risk changing the very basis of the way claims for benefit are dealt with <e> <s> difficult judgments about what is reasonable and what is necessary could well be involved and would be all the more difficult when they had to be made at arms length by central office <e> <s> in the new income-related benefits to be introduced this april we are trying to minimise this case-by-case questioning and instead move towards a system based on simple straightforward criteria which of course is to the benefit of the claimants themselves <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness lady turner wish to speak on this amendment <e> <s> i know that she has the next amendment which is similar <e>", "<cs> the guarantee of a place on the yts which guarantee is embodied in the employment bill currently before another place for every school-leaver under the age of who does not <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> whether it is possible to have a draft of the regulations circulated before the next stage i am afraid i do not know <e> <s> i will certainly inquire and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> this discussion has proved one thing <e> <s> there is a very good reason why these matters should not be in primary legislation <e> <s> let us suppose that we had this discussion on third reading of a bill and for the purposes of the bill i am thinking of your lordships house as the second chamber <e> <s> if we were to accede to the wishes of the committee and put these provisions into primary legislation only to find horror of horrors that we had left out a category it would be necessary to amend the primary legislation <e> <s> that takes much much longer than amending regulations as the noble baroness knows full well <e>", "<cs> i accept the point made by the noble lord lord henderson that primary and secondary legislation need not be mutually exclusive <e> <s> equally he will agree with me that they need not be mutually inclusive either <e> <s> having said that i will have to study and consider what the noble lord lord henderson has said in his short but extremely interesting speech <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee for agreeing to take the two amendments together because they are essentially similar in effect <e> <s> they deal with the entitlement to income support for disabled young people <e>", "<cs> we intend that when the regulations are framed there will be two distinct categories of people who will be in prescribed circumstances <e> <s> there will be those who are not required to be available for work and who will be entitled to income support without any time restriction <e> <s> this category will include and -year-olds who are lone parents couples with a child and those who by reason of disablement are incapable of work <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the noble lord another period of prescription which would be appropriate <e> <s> it is that of a pregnant or year-old who would be entitled to income support only for the period commencing weeks before the expected date of confinement and ending seven weeks after the date of confinement <e> <s> that would be a different length of prescribed period and we may well find others <e> <s> it is for that reason that we need to retain within the bill the flexibility of being able to prescribe different periods <e>", "<cs> unless it is a terrible misreading on my part it is the former circumstance <e>", "<cs> i believe that

unemployment benefit is made in order to establish the circumstances of the young person leaving or losing a job <e> <s> however with or year-olds the situation will be that when a job or a yts place is lost or left if the youngster registers for a yts place he will as i have said be paid a bridging allowance <e> <s> the authorities the adjudication officer in this case will always know <e>",

secretary of state as i have already explained <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i was indeed going far too fast <e> <s> the word was not discretion but <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> the matter of the delay was raised by the noble lord lord pitt <e> <s> the details of the case will be telephoned through to headquarters and we therefore intend that decisions on severe hardship will be made very speedily indeed <e>", "<cs> the decision would normally be made within hours <e> <s> if it is a very difficult case then obviously it will take longer <e>", "<cs> severe hardship is obviously a more parlous state than hardship <e> <s> it means something more than a mere tightening of the belt or doing without certain items which are normally part of a persons existence <e> <s> it means that the hardship must be of such a degree that there is a real risk to health or indeed to life itself <e> <s> i should include in that category sleeping out on the streets if that helps the noble lord lord pitt <e>", "<cs> the committee and indeed the house has gone down the road of this may/shall argument many times in the past <e> <s> on this occasion and in this part of the bill we do not intend that the secretary of state shall direct that income support should be payable in all cases where it appears to him that severe hardship will result <e>", "<cs> the beauty of the procedures in your lordships committee is that a debate on clause stand part enables me to say anything i want even though it not germane to the clause in question <e> <s> i hope to answer the noble baronesss point <e> <s> i am sure we all want to go home but if such an arrangement has been made through the usual channels it has not been communicated to me <e> <s> we have no representative of the usual channels here

education officials within district health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards direct funding i am not sure of the answer to my noble friends question <e> <s> however all but two district health authorities now have health education officers whose job it is to disseminate health education information <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i speak with personal experience of this matter <e> <s> unfortunately the addition of extra tax on cigarettes has not so far been found to be effective in stopping people smoking <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly a reduction in the number of ashtrays would help but the trouble is that in many cases the carpets might suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are entering the realms of hypothesis <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i certainly agree but i am not sure about the short sharp bursts <e> <s> if that were so i should be recommending my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science to make it a core curriculum subject <e> <s> i should have thought that short but wider-spread bursts would be more effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the health education authority is an organisation at arms length from government <e> <s> it is able and powerful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this clause implements our manifesto commitment

under who does not go into a job <e>", "<cs> i shall not get involved in that debate <e> <s> but i interrupt the noble baroness to say that we on this side of the chamber certainly share the sentiments expressed by her with regard to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we have a considerable amount of sympathy with the argument that adjudication arrangements for housing benefit should be brought into line with those for other social security benefits <e> <s> but this is not only a very important issue it is a very complicated one too involving difficult questions concerning the relationship between local authorities their staff acting as adjudication officers appeal tribunals and so on <e> <s> major administrative changes may also be involved and all this it has to be said again as it has been several times over the last few years against the background that we have no clear evidence that the present review arrangements whatever their deficiencies in principle are not generally working in practice <e>", "<cs> as i repeated earlier we have said all along that we intend to review housing benefit adjudication <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham referred to these people as tiny people which i accept although i should put them up a grade and describe them as little people <e> <s> they are the people who need the benefits that they are receiving and all the support that we can give them <e> <s> i certainly agree with that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful that the two amendments are grouped <e>", "<cs> having been present in your lordships chamber during recent weeks and months i thought that a probing amendment had gone out of fashion <e> <s> it is nice to meet one again and i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to respond <e> <s> i am advised that the voluntary employment period will not be lessened the provision will make no difference <e>", "<cs> in answer to these amendments i should like to repeat that it is government policy to concentrate available resources on the areas of greatest need <e> <s> we do not believe that it would be right to increase expenditure on that group of people who already enjoy the support which a substantial occupational pension provides <e> <s> with the limit at its present level unemployment benefit is not finally extinguished until substantial amounts of occupational pension are in payment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has much wider experience of these matters than i however i suspect that people with an investment income of over a week seldom fall into the benefit categories in any case <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> hope springs eternal <e> <s> these amendments would reduce the impact of the abatement provisions for all occupational pensioners aged and over by two means first by increasing the threshold at which it takes effect and secondly by committing the government to an annual adjustment of the threshold in line either with the lower earnings limit as the noble lord lord swann explained the rpi or average earnings <e>", "<cs> in the future legislation to which i have referred the government will take account of the current limit <e> <s> i believe that what i said as regards the last amendment stands for the moment that with the current very low level of inflation for which my noble friend has very generously given credit to the government the fact that the benefit remains payable up to the point where an occupational pension exceeds a week for a person with a dependent adult and so on means that it is a substantial figure and one that should not be lightly disregarded <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have not with me my ready reckoner of inflation proofing or real money <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> i had intended to give that very commitment <e> <s> we will seriously consider this matter when we consider the whole realm of future legislation <e>", "<cs> it seems a little strange at this time of year to be saying to the committee that i cannot prejudge or leak the contents of the queens speech but i am afraid that is very much the position <e>", "<cs> i ought to confirm straight away to the noble lord lord henderson that in the paragraphs of the bill which he asks shall cease to have effect we are maintaining the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for tabling the amendment because we all agree that it is necessary to help people pick themselves up as the noble lord put it <e> <s> the income support general regulations do just this in providing for the first of any income from a charitable or voluntary organisation to be disregarded <e> <s> this is an improvement on the currently disregarded in the supplementary benefit scheme <e> <s> by treating charitable and voluntary payments separately for disregard purposes trainees who also take up part-time employment can receive the or disregard on their earnings depending on their circumstances <e> <s> this would not be possible if the charity or the voluntary payments were treated as earnings <e> <s> here lies the problem <e>", "<cs> wearing my mental-illness and mental-handicap hat i of course see the problem <e> <s> that is why i have been sympathetic to what the noble lord said and to the essence the nut in the middle of the amendment that he has moved <e> <s> but as i say this is a major problem it is one thing to recognise a problem but quite another to find a solution bearing in mind the likely timescale of the bill within the context of the bill <e> <s> however i shall certainly be delighted to talk with the officials and the noble lords advisers to see whether some solution can eventually be found <e>", "<cs> my lords the government sympathise with everyone infected with the aids virus especially those who are terminally ill and with their families <e> <s> as far as haemophiliacs are concerned i am grateful for the appreciation of the noble lord of the million trust fund <e> <s> however he will agree with me that those haemophiliacs infected by contaminated blood products are in a unique position <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord banks has explained the intention of this amendment is to extend the scope of the social funds provision for cold weather payments beyond <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is proposing that we specify in statute the information that parliament should receive about the operation of the social fund <e> <s> it is the governments clear intention to monitor very closely the operation of the social fund and to collect a good deal of information about it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord banks responds i shall reply to various points that have been made <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull said that it was necessary for parliament and all the various charitable workers in this field to know who has been given grants and loans and who has been turned down <e> <s> that is a very balanced view if i may say so but the amendment is unbalanced <e> <s> it just looks at the negative side <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble baroness has included the money for the community care element in the social fund <e> <s> i also suspect that there is something else which is missing <e> <s> however i shall not swear to that at the moment <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider both those points <e>", "<cs> i shall obviously have to make that decision when i have completed the consideration which i offered to the committee in response to the intervention by the noble lord lord henderson <e>", "<cs> before responding to the amendment of the noble lord perhaps i may correct a reply that i gave to the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> the sum of million proposed for the social fund for the next financial year includes community care <e> <s> i apologise for misleading her <e> <s> however the noble baroness is only right as far as she goes <e> <s> in single payments totalled million <e> <s> the latest evidence suggests that for the figure will be about million for single payments <e> <s> there is not much to argue about between million and million <e> <s> however the first evidence may lead us to change our minds concerning the future <e>", "<cs> i agree that the rules certainly were tightened up as the noble lord will remember far better than i since he was concerned with this matter at that time and i was not <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> the noble lord was concerned with this subject and i was not <e>", "<cs> if the adjudication officer turns it down there is a person i cannot for the moment find the information <e>", "<cs> the answer to my noble friend is the social security appeals tribunal <e>", "<cs> i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> certainly the temper of the debate has changed in the last few minutes <e> <s> however earlier i made reference to a starred question that i answered from my noble friend lord moyne and i repeated the guts of that <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals for some reason took exception to the guts that i quoted just now <e> <s> whether the charities to which he also referred had read and taken on board that starred question i do not know <e> <s> however i know that his noble friend lady jeger received the encyclical that i promised after second reading <e> <s> i specifically stated in that encyclical that social fund applicants will not routinely be referred to charities <e> <s> where help is needed in an emergency or as a result of a disaster the procedure for consideration of other sources of help is similar to that operated under the current scheme for supplementary benefit single payments <e>", "<cs> the social fund officer would have to satisfy himself whether a suitable local charity exists with the money or service available <e>", "<cs> the first part of this amendment relates to a section of the act which has benefited greatly from the deliberations of this chamber <e> <s> as the noble lord lord banks said during the passage of the social security bill as it then was in on th june this chamber voted for an appeal system for the social fund the <e>", "<cs> social fund officers are part of the normal local office network and they are in the process of being trained <e> <s> social fund inspectors will not be needed until the officers make the first decisions <e> <s> that is why in answer to a recent question <e>", "<cs> one point is unarguable <e> <s> medical science has moved on since the time of my late right honourable friend sir winston churchill <e> <s> i do not want to go too far into that argument but it is undeniably the case <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will help if i abbrieviate what i have just said <e> <s> expectant mothers including girls under in income support families will still get the milk <e> <s> those in family credit families will not get the cash replacement but most will have just left work and will have access to the new maternity payment <e> <s> girls under in family credit families will attract the cash increase and so will their babies <e> <s> i hope that that helps the noble lord <e> <s> lord pitt <e>", "<cs> yes we are all driving at milk as it were <e> <s> i shall certainly look at the details of the two cases that the noble lord lord graham has mentioned <e> <s> however i think the committee will accept that the poorest families in our land it is probably the poorest families that we are most concerned about are those on supplementary benefit <e> <s> for those people on supplementary benefit there is no change in the provision <e>", "<cs> in responding to this amendment it occurs to me to wonder whether you fill lacunas with water <e> <s> having said that i am very grateful to the noble lord lord airedale for moving the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord elliott of morpeth who unfortunately is unable to be here this evening <e> <s> the government entirely accept the purpose of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the new right of an employee to decide for himself what sort of pension provision he wants is a key feature of the governments pension reforms introduced by the social security act <e> <s> clearly we cannot be content that a specific group of employees should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the feeling aroused by this subject <e> <s> i said that extra cases will be treated and i point out that in in london there were per cent <e> <s> more in-patient treatments than in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i quite follow the drift of the noble lords question <e> <s> however i suspect that he is asking generally rather than specifically with regard to london <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper is about reducing waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords the trend is fractionally up <e> <s> i confirm that the four thames regions between them account for per cent <e> <s> of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the trend as in the national trend is marginally up <e>", "<cs> my lords the two matters simply do not go together <e> <s> i have explained to the noble lord that we have spent extra money through our waiting list fund <e> <s> there is no possible correlation between that and regional health authorities and in this case in particular <e> <s> london district health authorities keeping within their budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely right and that has happened especially in london <e> <s> not only are london patients treated but patients come in from outside the four london regions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i would only add to that very helpful supplementary question that the problems in the acute service that the nhs faces are indeed problems of success <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> overall nurses pay has risen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e> <s> in contrast as she points out there was a fall in their pay to the value of per cent <e> <s> in real terms in the five years to <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody is concerned about waiting lists whether in london or anywhere else in the country <e> <s> that is why the government produced money for the waiting list fund which is having the effect that i have just described to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords yes most certainly <e> <s> however although i accept that every little helps and that this proposal enjoys popular support at the present time it would be unreasonable to expect a national lottery to make more than a marginal difference to nhs funding <e> <s> the health services act gave health authorities powers to raise money locally but did not extend to local lotteries <e> <s> as i said that matter will be given our active consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it quite clear that in the governments view every little helps <e> <s> in fund-raising activities by health authorities generated around million but that was only a small proportion of all their charitable income which totalled nearly million <e> <s> charitable fund-raising <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but the treasury currently receives million from taxation on gambling and it is important for that sum not to be endangered by the new sort of gambling proposed <e> <s> having said that i also believe that the million which is already raised from charitable income for the hospital service should equally not he put in danger <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some members of your lordships house and indeed many people outside who would not object to that <e> <s> clearly such matters would have to be considered extremely carefully <e> <s> however i am aware that the recommendations of the royal commission on gambling which were debated in this house in october concluded that it would be inappropriate to use a national lottery to help fund services such as the nhs which have a statutory source of funding and many of your lordships agreed at the time with that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to my noble friend <e> <s> i have not the slightest idea how much money is invested in the pools every week but taxation of the pools is around per cent <e> <s> and already raises vast amounts of money for general disbursement by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am afraid not <e> <s> the review as i have said on many occasions will be wide-ranging and fundamental <e> <s> we are concerned with the development of health services to meet the countrys needs for many years to come and we shall bring forward proposals in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords yes most certainly <e> <s> i recall only too well addressing the conference chaired by the noble baroness in the autumn <e> <s> however the money that she refers to would be comprised in the million which comes to the health service from charitable income from all sources at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time my noble friend puts me in some difficulty <e> <s> i have never heard of a lottery where one can have ones stake money refunded <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we do and that is why that is enshrined in various acts of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords one of my cautionary remarks this afternoon on the idea of a lottery has been that whatever we do should not endanger the million which is currently provided from charitable sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the press notice to which my noble friend has referred was unclear <e> <s> of course it would be quite improper for staff in dhss local offices to give advice on personal and occupational pensions <e> <s> therefore the phrase the pension providers means the people who provide those schemes for example unit trusts building societies and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there is a danger that people who sell such schemes are not always impartial <e> <s> that is why the department is publishing the leaflets to which i have already referred which would give impartial advice but of course it cannot go into detail and compare individual schemes <e> <s> people would be well advised first to consult their employer and secondly to obtain professional advice from for example solicitors or accountants before making up their minds on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no information that hospices are not prepared to provide resting places for people suffering from aids <e> <s> however hospices are not the only places where people are likely to die <e> <s> for example i understand only per cent <e> <s> of cancer patients die in hospices <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but as i have just said not necessarily within the context of hospices <e> <s> we have no intention of establishing dedicated aids hospice provision through the voluntary bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no system of formal support along the lines the noble lord lord ennals has mentioned <e> <s> however we give large amounts of extra money to the health services in order to carry out that support which is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware that mildmay mission hospital was taking its first patients tomorrow <e> <s> as regards funding all the hospice movement is operated on revenue financed by contributions both from ordinary people through voluntary donations and also through the good auspices of the health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem which the noble lord brings to the attention of the house today is one as he says of a reduction in the number of beds in that particular paediatric unit from to <e> <s> i should make the point that within that unit are exactly the same number of doctors and the same number of nurses <e> <s> what has happened is that with advances in medical science which mean that smaller babies can now be treated for example babies under lb <e> <s> in weight it has become necessary to use intensive care nursing with more nurses per baby <e> <s> i am aware that the district health authority is in discussion with the regional health authority to produce two more cots for the unit but that will require extra staffing <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was trying to make clear is that there is no cut in resources in that case <e> <s> i explained why namely because of the medical decisions made on the ward there had been a reduction from to cots <e> <s> i also explained that discussions were going on between the district health authority and the regional health authority to have two more beds in the unit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the nature of the demand has changed and the circumstances have changed to take account of it <e>", "<cs> my lords within the region yes <e> <s> within any particular district i am afraid that i am unable to give that assurance <e> <s> i repeat that discussions are going on to provide two extra cots for that unit <e>", "<cs> my lords yes within the waiting list fund quite a lot of money has been found for central manchester as has from the special bridging fund and has come from the extra allocation announced by my right honourable friend the minister for health in december <e> <s> it is for the region and the district concerned to allocate precisely where those moneys are to go <e>", "<cs> my lords to exemplify my original answer to the first supplementary question of the noble lord lord dean nothing is saved in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as i told the house the other day a new training course in birmingham for such nurses will be provided very shortly <e> <s> over and above that there is the problem of people leaving the nursing profession <e> <s> the reason is widely regarded as being the amount of pay for particularly stressful occupations of which i would regard paediatric nursing and intensive care paediatric nursing as two examples <e> <s> we are waiting for the report of the nurses and midwives salary review body to tell us where it considers that extra moneys would be most appropriately spent <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments responsibility is underlined by the national health service act which as the house well knows gives us the duty to provide health care facilities <e> <s> we do this on the basis of delegation to regions and from regions to district health authorities <e> <s> it has always been done in this way <e> <s> the governments primary responsibility in this area is to make enough finances available globally for such distribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the assurance that sufficient beds will be available in the region <e> <s> however for obvious reasons i am unable to do so for particular districts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am able to answer the questions that are put to me only to the best of my ability <e> <s> however i confirm that the review body is being asked to recommend rates of pay for a new grading structure for clinical nurses which has recently been agreed by the nursing and midwifery staffs negotiating council <e> <s> the new structure will mean better rewards and recognition for those nurses who provide hands-on care to patients and will place more emphasis on post-basic skills in key specialisms such as paediatric nursing and intensive care <e>", "<cs> gross expenditure on the national health service in the united kingdom in was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is a very large number of voluntary organisations representing the disabled and there has been a distinct increase in the number <e> <s> this is why my honourable friend had a number of informal and confidential talks with a variety of organisations as he said in the press notice <e> <s> it was his assessment that the disablement income group made the most interesting suggestions for setting up the trust fund <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most important that the moneys provided by this trust fund should be extra to the normal social security benefits <e> <s> having said that details of the administration of the fund are still being developed <e> <s> when the trustees are appointed they will wish to make the final decisions on these issues <e> <s> however at this stage we envisage that the day-to-day running of the fund and the assessment of routine claims will not be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords no most certainly not <e> <s> the money is intended primarily to provide regular payments to very severely disabled people to enable them to live independently <e> <s> it also includes provision for administration costs <e> <s> as i have said in answer to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale we will clearly have to consider funding for future years in the light of experience <e>", "<cs> my lords because the new statutory system which will operate from april necessarily has a very broad-brush effect <e> <s> in answering for this particular group of very disabled people we are concerned that it would be impossible to fit them into the scheme <e> <s> therefore special arrangements have had to be made and they are being made most urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords details of that nature are still being worked out but i would again make the point that it is important that the people who unfortunately find themselves in this position should get all the state benefits due to them <e> <s> the scheme will then decide whether extra payment from the trust fund is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made clear that this is extra government money administered by independent trustees to cope with a particular and devastating range of disabilities <e> <s> the problem does not yet occur it will not occur until after april this year <e> <s> we have adopted a solution that we believe will have the flexibility to cater for the individual needs of a severely disabled person whereas the income support scheme which begins in april targets help to broad groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had answered that point <e> <s> i have said that million has been made available <e> <s> we shall see whether that is sufficient once we have the scheme up and running <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that the trust deed will be made public and will be available for inspection by any member of parliament or any member of the public <e> <s> on the noble baronesss second point <e> <s> i can only reiterate that this money which is independently distributed by a trust fund has nothing to do with any existing charitable body <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> in more recent times it would equate with the trust fund which the government are in the process of setting up for the unfortunate haemophiliacs who have become infected with aids <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> the point of course arises as to how temporary is temporary <e> <s> i said originally in answer to the noble lord that the winding up of the scheme is likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords section does not cover all ex-patients from mental illness hospitals but as i have just explained only the detained ones <e> <s> in march the home office and the department of health and social security jointly published revised guidelines for hospitals consultant psychiatrists social workers and probation officers on the supervision and after-care of mentally disordered offenders subject to a restriction under the mental health act <e> <s> the revised guidance was welcomed by the mental health act commission <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> i would acid that over the past eight months or so i have been in a position to study the act and the proposals and circumstances flowing from it <e> <s> i reiterate that care in the community as such which is being studied by sir roy griffiths at the moment is rather broader than this question actually implies <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes to the first part of the noble baronesss <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in some parts of the country joint finance is being arranged between local authorities social services departments and health authorities <e> <s> in other parts of the country health authorities give an annual dowry <e> <s> however it is most important that nobody should be discharged from hospital without a proper plan for his after-care <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little to add to the very extensive question time debate which we had on this subject the other day except to say that my right honourable friend has registered the strong concern of your lordships that it should be published and published soon and is giving the matter his urgent consideration <e>", "<cs> no my lords but section refers to sections and of the act <e> <s> those sections cover what i might call various grades of compulsorily detained patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has on more than one occasion in the house stated forcibly and with feeling her objections to the governments proposals in relation to the industrial injuries scheme including the introduction of a new benefit retirement allowance <e> <s> the noble baroness has carried out the promise or was it a threat <e> <s> that she made in committee to return to the fray <e> <s> i certainly agree that these three amendments are part and parcel of each other <e> <s> the net result is that the value of the benefit paid in retirement would be doubled <e> <s> i have to say that the amendments would have a further effect the noble baroness did not say whether it was intended or not whereby the minimum rate of retirement allowance would be set at a week at todays rates <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem from the speech of the noble lord lord banks when introducing the amendment that my answer to a similar one in committee was like the instruction that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord carter for tabling this amendment and to all noble lords who have spoken to it in this short debate today <e> <s> i believe we are at one in what we are trying to achieve in this area and i believe that the noble lord lord ennals put his finger on it straight away <e> <s> we are filling a lacuna and let me add temporarily <e> <s> that lacuna is to enable severely disabled people to live independently in the community <e> <s> we have already said that we intend to establish a trust fund to achieve just that end and to make up to million available to that fund in <e> <s> it will be an independent trust set up with advice from the disablement income group <e> <s> this new clause seeks to put that commitment on a statutory footing <e> <s> i believe that this is unecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the working definition we have been using between those terms is to distinguish between those people who but for the coming into force of the new scheme on th april would be on different rates under the new benefit scheme <e> <s> in other words if exactly the same injury were incurred on th april the claimant would receive a higher amount than that same claimant would have received two days later <e> <s> it is this anomaly that the whole scheme is designed to clear up <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last point i undertook to consider the matter in committee and that is what i have done <e> <s> the house will recall that in response to a telling intervention from my noble friend lord selkirk i gave details in committee of the categories of and year-olds who would be entitled to income support throughout and of those so entitled only during the child benefit extension period <e> <s> following that i wrote to those noble lords involved in the debate and enclosed with the letter a copy of the provisional lists a and b covering the type of exemption case that we intend to put in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says unfortunately but that is the answer and i submit a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that i should be able to satisfy the noble lord by repeating that we intend a prescribed period to be used in all cases of entitlement but clearly i am unable to do so <e> <s> we shall have to see how we get on <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand only too well the purport of the amendment and the strong feelings which many of your lordships have evinced this evening on the subject <e> <s> it would be appropriate for me first of all to turn to the amendment itself so ably introduced by the noble lord <e> <s> lord banks <e> <s> i am afraid there is a basic misunderstanding here as to how decisions come to be made on whether a benefit should be uprated or not <e> <s> time does not permit me to go into the details of each and every benefit <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord banks has said the amendment only relates to one child benefit <e> <s> i have to advise the house that child benefit is already subject to an annual review under section of the social security act <e> <s> the act requires the secretary of state to review the benefit in each tax year in order to determine whether it has retained its value in relation to the general level of prices <e> <s> the act goes on to provide for the benefit to be uprated if the secretary of state considers it appropriate having regard to the national economic situation and any other matters which he considers relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is designed to delay the introduction of our proposal to reduce the age threshold for the abatement provision by a further four years beyond january to april beyond the life of the present parliament <e> <s> i have no doubt that the main purpose of the amendment is to ensure that this measure will never be brought into force at all <e> <s> however as the noble baroness has said is she denying it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness says no <e> <s> i accept that it is a major point but that would be an effect <e> <s> as the noble baroness said it would also provide a stay of execution for all those in the to age group despite the fact that many of them are receiving substantial occupational pensions and give those people who will find themselves in that age bracket in five years time even more time to plan their finances accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a basic requirement for receiving income support that a fit person of working age is available for work or is within one of the groups which is exempt <e> <s> i think that that is common ground between us all <e> <s> even persons who are only fit for a limited range of jobs because of physical or mental disablement will be required to be available <e> <s> where the adjudication officer dealing with a claim for incapacity benefit decides that a person is not entitled to that benefit he will be required to be available for work if he claims income support <e> <s> let us take the case where there is a conflict of medical opinion for example where there have been two references for examination by doctors of the regional medical service and they consider the claimant fit for work but the claimants own doctor continues to advise him to refrain from work and to issue medical statements that he is incapable of work <e> <s> that is the point illustrated by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> the claimant may decide not to sign on at the unemployment benefit office <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount is adjusted if the appeal is successful and not withdrawn if it is not successful <e> <s> it is that which i suspected i needed to spell out <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> the point is that if the appeal is successful the amount of money by which the claimant has been shortchanged if you like is subsequently made up to the full amount so the claimant does not lose out <e> <s> i think that that is one negative but i am not sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say straightaway that in recognition of the valuable part played by firemen in the safety and civil defence of this country the income support regulations already provide that their earnings will be subject to the higher disregard normally available to lone parents people receiving the disability premium and couples under who have been receiving benefit for two years <e> <s> this provision recognises the special nature of the duties firemen perform and gives them the higher disregard straightaway <e> <s> however it is inconsistent in an income-related scheme intended to provide a minimum level of support to people who have no or insufficient resources of their own to ignore larger amounts of income the more earnings we disregard the higher the cost to the taxpayer and the less we have to spend on improving basic levels of benefits <e> <s> it must also be remembered that income support is paid to many thousands of elderly or disabled people who are unable to work and thus gain the advantage of the disregard <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to start my response to this amendment by explaining why it was necessary on the grounds that my noble friends have just adduced <e> <s> but when i began my response to an earlier amendment this afternoon by saying that it was unnecessary and then went on to explain why the instant reaction i received from the benches opposite was oh it doesnt matter <e> <s> we will divide anyway on another point <e> <s> but never mind lets get on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware yes <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord and also to others who are interested and if they find it necessary to come back to the point at the next stage of course they are perfectly at liberty to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am advised that the social fund commissioner is not subject to the parliamentary commissioner for administration so i misinformed the noble lord and i apologise to him for that <e> <s> he does not take the decision of course but it is the people who take the decisions and it is they for whom i understand the noble baroness wants a measure of review whose decisions will be subject to the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> so i confirm that the noble baroness has under the existing statue got what she wants on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords would that i could <e> <s> i understand it to say that the role of the commissioner is to appoint the social fund inspectors to train them and to monitor their decisions but as i said just now it is they who are making the decisions and it is they who are caught under the ombudsman legislation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> since i was prepared to write to the noble lord lord henderson anyway i will still write even though he has got the answer to his original point following my consideration of the point that he has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords we have repeatedly made clear our intention to operate an extra cold <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the point made by the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lord lord banks that the social fund is a new form of animal and parliament will want to know what that animal is made up of as it progresses <e> <s> that is why we published the social fund budget allocations as early as november last year and produced the guidance to social fund officers as a published document which has been available from her majestys stationery office since november <e> <s> it is also why i promised in committee that a great deal of information would be forthcoming on the operation of the fund <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the speech of the noble lord lord ennals he gave the impression of a jealous god seeking to visit the sins of a forebear onto succeeding generations if i may be allowed to paraphrase the wording of a much older system of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that remark was made before i sat down <e> <s> before i do sit down perhaps i may repeat what probably inelegantly i said earlier in answer to the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> my noble friend said that the social fund will not at first be subject to a formal cash limit on its introduction and i said that a decision on what will be the normal cash limiting arrangements will be taken when we have sufficient experience of the operation of the fund <e> <s> that remains exactly the same today as it did when my noble friend said it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i really think that i must seek the leave of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the cash limit in the technical definition i have given is not set today <e> <s> it will not be set on st april or th april <e> <s> what has been set is a budget for financial management purposes by which each local office has to be constrained <e>", "<cs> my lords at this point i am not quite sure exactly what i am asking leave for but notwithstanding that i ask for such leave <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord trafford for explaining the difference which i endeavoured to do between a budget and a cash limit <e> <s> one cannot have formal financial responsibility without a budget <e> <s> the noble lord no doubt runs a house and therefore has a budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not talking about cash limits i am talking about budgets <e> <s> the noble lord may recall that there is a power in the bill on page of schedule at line whereby it is possible to shift resources in certain circumstances between offices <e> <s> that provision cannot mean that there is a cash limit on those particular offices by definition that is impossible <e> <s> therefore i am able to confirm that the million is a budget and not a cash limit <e> <s> nationally and locally social fund officers will be working to that figure <e> <s> a formal cash limit in the terms which i am sure the noble lord understands will be set in in other words the cash limit will not apply for the first year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry that my noble friend cannot understand the careful and constructive work that the draftsman has done on the amendments <e> <s> i can assure him they concern merely two minor points <e> <s> the first is a drafting amendment to a government amendment no <e> <s> k which was laid in committee the second is a consequential technical amendment <e> <s> they relate to the governments intention to safeguard the position of those claimants who might otherwise face a sudden loss of unemployment benefit when doubt arises about their availability for work <e> <s> under existing arrangements benefit is stopped until the adjudication officer has decided the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords to put a slightly different gloss on the question asked by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale since the noble lord asked a question of the government front bench on nd march last year six sections of the act have been implemented <e> <s> as i say discussions are under way to bring into force section <e> <s> the government have consistently made it clear that the provisions of the act would have to be introduced gradually and so that will come as no surprise to the house <e>", "<cs> yes i must certainly agree with my noble friend <e> <s> a measure of our concern for effective after-care is that we plan to issue detailed guidance about that in two or three months in relation to mental illness <e> <s> in relation to mentally handicapped people the problem is much better known and much more widely understood <e> <s> in terms of the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord allen the situation is not nearly so patchy <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i most certainly agree with the premise advanced by my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> a million training award was announced recently by my right honourable friend the minister for health <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the sums are concerned this is something which we are discussing with the local authority organisations <e> <s> it has been suggested in certain quarters that we are talking about up to milion but i would not put too much reliance on that <e> <s> as regards the general premise of after-care as i said in my original answer this is a joint operation between social services departments and district and sometimes regional health authorities <e> <s> this is another point on which discussions will have to be pursued <e>", "<cs> my lords no i could not say that there was adequate care in per cent <e> <s> of those cases <e> <s> i should have to look at the individual cases to establish whether there was <e> <s> ultimately it is the responsibility of the district health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords at present we have no plans to call in the riverside proposal <e> <s> however any major capital scheme for a new westminster and chelsea hospital proposed by riverside health authority would need the approval of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords since my right honourable friend has as yet made no decision to call in the proposal i think it would be a mistake for me to answer the noble lord directly <e> <s> however this matter is out to consultation <e> <s> i have no doubt that the community health council for the riverside health authority will establish in its own mind the validity of what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give a categoric assurance that no formal approval has been given by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the riverside health authority has established that it no longer meets present-day criteria and that in the authoritys view it is in the wrong place <e> <s> that is the substance of the consultation paper to reformulate the provision of hospitals within the health authority area <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly intense interest in the hospital among members both of your lordships house and of another place as well as among the staff of the palace of westminster although they may not be the most numerous of the people served by it <e> <s> the health authority is very well aware of that and i understand that the implications of any change are being discussed with the relevant officers of both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the authority has produced a large scheme which affects three hospitals <e> <s> there is no doubt that this money is included within the total cost of those hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as one plan is concerned it is quite normal for a district health authority to make up its mind what it wants to do and then to put the matter out to consultation <e> <s> the procedure is just the same now as it was in the noble lords day <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the value which the local authority presumably rather than the district health authority put on cemeteries in the area <e> <s> however i would make the point that riverside has three district general hospitals charing cross in the east st stephens fulham and westminster in the west <e> <s> the district health authority considers that only two district general hospitals are needed <e> <s> that is the rationale for putting this plan out to consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords the draft order we have been debating has a role to play in encouraging people to think and act responsibly as well as providing a penalty for those who bear a measure of blame for their own lack of a job <e>", "<cs> my lords if they have no say or no choice in the matter this order would not apply to them <e> <s> that is exactly the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i dispute that <e> <s> the fact is that if there was an increase of per cent <e> <s> or more i would immediately argue that the current sanctions or penalties as the noble baroness called them were not working <e> <s> that is the rationale for the order as i explained in my opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords to me voluntary unemployment means a condition into which people put themselves through no fault of their own and i believe <e>", "<cs> through not fault of their own <e> <s> i think that that definition will be acceptable to the house <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that i have stood on my head <e> <s> if i am to sit down at all on a long-term basis tonight perhaps i may continue to answer the various points put to me or at least as many of them as possible <e> <s> i am sure that there will be one or two points which i miss and i shall write to noble lords who are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> that is the one point for which i did not come prepared this evening <e> <s> if the noble baroness wants this matter included in the record of the house i suggest that she puts down a question for written answer in which case it would be on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble lords who have welcomed this amendment especially the noble lord lord banks and my noble friend lord moyne who has shown great interest going back very many years in charitable matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals is still trying to visit the sins not of the fathers but of the mothers on to the sons <e> <s> i can only repeat what i have already said and what i thought i had already made clear <e> <s> my noble friend lady trumpington was not in error in what she said during the passage of the act <e> <s> noble lords will find the relevant passage in the <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i will <e> <s> additional contingency allocations will only be made to meet unforeseeable additional demands <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hope that there is no misunderstanding <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords the social fund officer referred to in the amendment would be the local office manager of the social security office <e> <s> in a large office there may well be two social fund officers with junior officers operating the budget of the office in question <e> <s> it may well be necessary for somebody to knock heads together for want of a better expression <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e> <s> that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords after that i almost do not know where to put myself <e> <s> i should like to make two brief points <e> <s> nobody receives benefits from income tax changes <e> <s> any changes of the kind envisaged by the noble baroness will have one object only and that is to allow people to keep more of their own money <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that it shows extraordinary insensitivity at all <e> <s> as is well known the government make known their public expenditure plans in detail in january of each year <e> <s> the budget explains how those plans will be financed <e> <s> however the house should note that in his budget speech yesterday my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said that over the coming year we shall be spending at least million more on health care than in the year now ending <e> <s> that can be found at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government always pay attention to and study with great care the reports of select committees of another place <e> <s> in this case the government will be making a formal response in due course <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state thought it right to make clear that the government do not accept that there is any need to provide additional funds in respect of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> there is indeed an internal inquiry chaired by my right honourable friend the prime minister which is examining the resources state and management of the national health service <e> <s> it will be for my right honourable friend to make a decision firstly as to how long the inquiry will continue and secondly whether a report of some kind will issue from it at the end <e> <s> i shall be very surprised if there is not a report <e>", "<cs> my lords i observed that it rained for much of yesterday <e> <s> i did not notice that the health employees who took industrial action made budget day into a national health service day <e> <s> i already know of operations which had to be cancelled yesterday as a result of that industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord the leader of the opposition i made clear that <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree absolutely with my noble friend <e> <s> i should like to see the conclusions resulting from the review to which the noble lord lord mellish referred and the various whitley council and pay review body awards to be based fairly and squarely upon logic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness welcomes the proposal in general <e> <s> it will indeed make a difference to those nurses who are clubbing together because the new arrangements apply per house rather than per person <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect that is a very good question <e> <s> the basic answer is that services have been allowed to expand to a greater extent than the money available <e>", "<cs> my lords the answers to the two parts of my noble friends supplementary question are yes and no <e> <s> although the united kingdom spends less of its gdp on health care than some other countries it has no worse health as a result <e> <s> for example it has a lower rate of infant mortality than austria belgium italy and the united states all of which spend more <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> on the second part of the supplementary question the record levels of health service expenditure which i described in my original answer have been made possible by the governments economic strategy which has now seen the longest period of steady growth at an average annual rate of per cent <e> <s> since the war <e> <s> when considering figures additional amounts of money for the national health service the important factor is to make sure that what is allocated is wisely and properly spent <e> <s> therefore yes of course we take account of prices and wage inflation within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i had better not go into the question of privatisation in answering a question on the health service in your lordships house <e> <s> however these are record levels and how the noble lord can possibly describe them as a cut is beyond my comprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed i am aware of that but quite clearly noble lords opposite are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to relate that question to the one that i am trying to answer today <e> <s> however i would point out that there are quite a considerable number of people for example consultants within the health service who will he helped by the reduction in the higher rates of tax in pursuing their chosen activity <e>", "<cs> my lords no of course it is not a result of government policy <e> <s> the noble lord should understand that we should all be thinking and talking about patients and not furniture <e> <s> over million more in-patient cases are now being treated than in <e> <s> the number of cases is million a rise of per cent <e> <s> and that is the important figure to keep in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords at least billion extra for the national health service next year is no cut <e>", "<cs> my lords health authorities already raise income in a variety of ways and we are currently seeking powers in the health and medicines bill which will come before your lordships shortly to enhance their ability to do this <e> <s> the income generation unit which will start work early in the new financial year will help authorities to obtain the maximum benefit from both existing and new powers <e>", "<cs> my lords the income generation unit to which i referred in my original answer has been set up to establish good practice in the income generation field and to help develop and disseminate new opportunities <e> <s> it will be headed by mr ron kerr currently a district general manager in the north hertfordshire district health authority and will be staffed by a mixture of seconded national health service employees and civil servants <e> <s> it will be up and running early in the new financial year <e> <s> we expect the income generation to increase funding for the health service by approximately million to million in rising over three years to over million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very wide power to which the noble lord has drawn attention <e> <s> i believe it would be better to discuss it during the period given over to discussion of the health and medicines bill rather than now <e>", "<cs> my lords every little extra is welcome as i am sure the noble lord will agree <e> <s> i can confirm that health authorities will be able to keep the money they raise <e>", "<cs> my lords i expect that those hospitals that decide to go in for the scheme in a big way would need an extra person in order to carry it out <e>", "<cs> my lords not specifically <e> <s> the income generation unit will be up and running early in the new financial year <e> <s> as regards the extra powers under the health and medicines bill they will depend on the date of royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a reason however why planning should not be conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has slightly misunderstood the position <e> <s> national health service sight tests are carried out under the national health service act either as part of the general ophthalmic service arrangements which family practitioner committees make with ophthalmic opticians and ophthalmic medical practitioners or as part of the hospital eye service <e> <s> in the cases cited by him the tests will continue to be done under the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy in this area like many other parts of their policy is that those people who can afford to pay and who fall outside the exempt categories should do so <e> <s> there is not much difference between that position and for example the prescription service which the noble lord knows well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to convey those thoughts to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services because the professionals have already made him well aware of them <e> <s> however i should like to make the point that patients will still need to obtain a prescription for their glasses and therefore will still have their eyes checked regularly <e> <s> there are no plans to change the existing type of test which of course is all-important where the detection of glaucoma cancers and other diseases of the eye might be thrown up <e>", "<cs> my lords they will cost them nothing <e> <s> insulin-dependent diabetics who are likely to form the bulk of users of blood glucose testing strips are exempt from prescription charges so the supply will be completely free <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second question is yes because they will be prescribed through the good offices of the sufferers general practitioners who will need to be assured that the strips are properly used <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a date but certainly it will be in time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that that is a fast ball from the noble lord <e> <s> my understanding is that the answer to the noble lord is no because we can do this under existing regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be more than grateful to the noble lord lord ennals that at last after all this time we are debating a motion to call attention to the state of the national health service <e> <s> i do not know about other noble lords but i have been holding my breath all winter <e> <s> i must hold it for a little while longer until i have heard the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford to which we are all looking forward <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> he has of course recognised that we have long-term plans for at least billion next year billion the year after and billion the year after that <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing certain in this debate is that i regret there is absolutely no way i can take on board every point that has been made <e> <s> therefore i shall be

training themselves <e> <s> what matters is the quality of life <e> <s> the recent reduction in the tax rates thanks to my right honourable friends budget means that it will be easier to keep those

concentration of regional specialities including neonatal intensive care and the regional health authority has undertaken to conduct a comprehensive review of regional specialities <e> <s> in so doing it has asked all health authorities to provide two cots each for neonatal intensive care <e> <s> the noble lord may well be right as regards the figures for central manchester <e> <s> however i believe that the problem should be viewed region-wide rather than centralising inquiries on a specific hospital in a specific district <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a long-established practice in those

i accept that premature babies or indeed any babies cannot be put on a waiting list for obvious reasons <e> <s> the important point is that the service should be region-wide or within that part of the region where it is necessary and should not necessarily be concentrated in one particular hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords the disagreement initially would be between the community health council or councils depending on the area and the district health authority which wants to carry out the closure <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is using the word cuts in a slightly loose fashion <e> <s> what has happened in this particular case is that the doctors and nurses involved decided to approach the general manager of the district so that they could concentrate on very very low weight babies for which fewer cots were needed <e> <s> the more normal low weight deliveries as one might call them would then be treated at other hospitals in the immediate vicinity <e> <s> that is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords no emphatically not <e> <s> there has been no cut in the funding or staffing of the unit <e> <s> as i have said the reduction was made on medical advice

are that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree <e> <s> that is why i undertook to keep the matter under continuous review <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the government will be looking at that extremely important question because a report has recently been published by your lordships select committee on science and technology covering exactly that subject <e> <s> the government welcome that report as an important contribution to the discussion about the future of medical research <e> <s> however it is addressed to the government as a whole and it will take some time for a government response to appear to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome my noble friends remarks about the video <e> <s> i am not sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not give direct financial

royal college of nurses <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the professional industrial and commercial updating project which is being developed by the nhs training authority in association with professional and statutory bodies will offer multi-disciplinary continuing education and training opportunities for nurses and professions allied to medicine with exactly that aim in view <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will know that i cannot with the best will in the world anticipate the contents of the queens speech for next session or indeed for any other session <e> <s> having said that i hope that there will be no undue delay in bringing forward legislation on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot and do not accept that the government have their priorities wrong <e>

family business in the courts wherever they happen to be and at whatever level in court hierarchy they may be <e> <s> however the governments first priority is to get right the substantive law

unrecorded or unreported <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware of the history of this particular question <e> <s> of course the whole house concurs with the sentiments expressed by the noble baroness lady masham <e>", "<cs> my lords as to whether there is a restriction on the age of the donor there is no such restriction by law but it is for the clinicians involved to decide whether organs are suitable for transplant <e> <s> that will depend on a number of matters including the age and physical condition of the donor and the organs involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord ennals on both counts <e>", "<cs> my lords i can advise the house that following advice from the medical royal colleges we are drafting a health circular which will ask health authorities to establish procedures for identifying potential organ donors and referring them to transplant units <e> <s> that will be issued by the end of the year <e> <s> therefore in essence i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may advise my noble friend to await the arrival of the circular <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the particular worry which the noble viscount has which concerns as i understand it the use of foetal material <e> <s> this is a subject which has gained prominence in recent days <e> <s> the use of that material in this country is subject to the guidelines set down in the code of practice recommended in the report of the advisory group on the use of foetuses and foetal material for research known as the peel report which was published in <e>

purport of the question of the noble countess <e> <s> if she will rephrase it i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords recently those cards have been available in post offices and indeed there is a supply available in the central lobby at this moment <e> <s> however i agree with the noble countess that it is necessary to have good stocks more widely available at points where people will regularly seek them <e> <s> such places include doctors surgeries hospital waiting departments and post offices and it may well be possible to enter into an arrangement with the banks to hold stocks of these cards <e>", "<cs> my lords with the deepest regret i am unable to confirm or deny such stories but i shall look into the matter and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case the noble lord will have to contain his soul in disappointment <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed i am aware of the reference in the commissions second biennial report on this matter <e> <s> all health authorities received a copy of the report of course and i would expect them to take note of the commissions comments <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards that act the government are pursuing its implementation <e> <s> it was always made clear was it not <e> <s> that that would depend on resource allocations and agreement between local authorities and central government <e> <s> this is being pursued as vigorously as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i accept that <e> <s> i regard it as very disturbing that the mental health act commission in its second biennial report felt the need to make the remarks that it did <e> <s> that is why it is absolutely essential that all health authorities should get this information <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no targeted fund for health authorities as regards mental illness <e> <s> it is up to health authorities to judge their priorities in the light of local circumstances <e> <s> where this is being carried out properly there is no need for them to reorder their priorities <e> <s> where it is not being carried out properly clearly there is a need for that reordering <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed they can <e> <s> i should however point out that subsection of section states <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me one intervention <e> <s> i did not quite hear from whom he was quoting <e> <s> if it was not from

advisory committees sixth report <e> <s> the government welcome the committees contribution to the debate about the benefit system as indeed they welcome all such constructive and learned publications <e> <s> i am sure that this house is extremely impressed by the thorough-going nature of the analysis in what is as we all know an extremely complex area <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that my noble friend and the noble baroness clearly agree <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will also accept that one can only have that by getting people into work in the first place <e> <s> in part that is what government policy seeks to achieve <e> <s> however one has to ask oneself which is better to have people in work with low wages topped up by social security benefits or merely have them on social security and not in work <e> <s> i have no difficulty in telling the house which i should prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness pre-empted me on what i was going to say on this precise fact <e> <s> the original question asked by the noble baroness was about charities and not about the social fund <e> <s> the first of any occasional payments made by a charity will be treated as capital and will not therefore affect the level of benefit in payments unless it takes existing capital above the limit in which case the normal income rules that i have described would apply <e>", "<cs> it did not my lords <e> <s> the scale of fees for general dental practitioners already includes payment for the treatment of the early signs of tooth decay using the technique shown in the video <e> <s> we shall shortly be discussing with the profession whether any clarification of the description of this treatment in the scale is needed in the light of developments in clinical practice <e> <s> i am indeed aware that the profession is concerned that dentists did not receive their copies of the video until after the public launch and that they felt disadvantaged when patients were aware through the media before them <e> <s> i can confirm that this will not happen again <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in answer to both those questions <e> <s> training is of the essence and it is important that the dental profession as any other publicly-funded profession produces value for money <e> <s> the government are concerned that dentists who have been absent from active practice for long periods for whatever reason and dentists in practice should undergo some refresher training either to continue in their practice or before they re-enter a practice <e> <s> we have made this quite clear in the white paper and in our discussions with dentists we shall continue to pursue it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the growing concern on this matter <e> <s> that is why the issue was put to the committee on toxicity in <e> <s> the committee stated that in its opinion the use of dental amalgam was free from the risk of systemic toxicity and only a few cases of hypersensitivity occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i can truthfully say that speaking on behalf of the government i have been studying this problem for quite a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly why training is so important <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that this is an unsatisfactory situation <e> <s> the government recognised that after th april there would be a small number of newly severely disabled people who would fit into the categories and who would not receive the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course pay great tribute to my noble friend for his involvement in setting up the disablement income group <e> <s> however i have to say that the scheme will not be run by it <e> <s> the trust will be totally independent <e> <s> the digs role is to be involved in setting up the trust and we are extremely grateful to that organisation for its advice in so doing <e> <s> there will of course be dig-nominated trustees but the day-to-day administration will be carried out by the trust funds

about this scheme and about how the problem might best be resolved <e> <s> during the course of these discussions dig offered to assist in setting up the fund and we were delighted to accept its offer

there is a well-tried procedure for help with filling out such forms from social security offices <e> <s> as regards publicising the fund the people to whom i referred have clearly been able to make contact with <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have only recently set the fund up it is a little early to talk about replacement <e> <s> however i confirm that it is temporary and we anticipate that its time limit will be between three and five years <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the payments will be back-dated to the appropriate time <e> <s> as regards the case to which i have just referred that occurred on th april but if someone becomes disabled on th may it will be necessary to backdate until then <e> <s> i can certainly confirm that this will be done <e> <s> with regard to the arrangements for the trustees that will be a matter for them when they are appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather hypothetical question and it will depend upon the precise details of each case <e> <s> as i have

health authorities <e> <s> over the national health service estate as a whole the government estimate that almost per cent <e> <s> of property is available for disposal in the immediate future and a further per cent <e> <s> should be available over the next years <e> <s> all proceeds from the sale of surplus property are retained within the health service for reinvestment within that service

whether the unit is actually within the precincts of the palace <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> that is the reason the programme has not been introduced much faster than has been the case so far <e> <s> however all parts of the country should have a service by <e> <s> we hope to be able to announce details for the remaining centres in england by july <e>", "<cs> my lords in my earlier answer i mentioned five mobile basic screening units for wales <e> <s> those units are particularly applicable to use in rural areas <e> <s> so far as concerns rural areas of scotland and england i do not have details at the moment <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as in the rest of the united kingdom breast cancer screening will be introduced in stages <e> <s> it is intended that the first screening unit should be in place later this year and that a service covering the whole of northern ireland should be operational by the end of <e> <s> initially arrangements are being made to train northern ireland staff at one of the national centres <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed a possibility <e> <s> that is why i was a little cagey in answering my noble friends first supplementary question <e> <s> counselling and clinical judgments by the doctors concerned are all-important in this area <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there is constant discussion on those matters <e> <s> i welcome british telecoms approach <e> <s> it is very important that such private screening should be fully interlinked with the national health service <e> <s> otherwise gaps may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin perhaps rather to his surprise by agreeing with the noble lord lord prys-davies when he said that the debate has largely focused on three issues the dental examination charge sight tests and cash limits <e> <s> this reply will take some time to explain but noble lords will appreciate that this is only the second reading of the bill and i anticipate other stages <e> <s> i was grateful for the way in which the noble lord lord winstanley made his speech <e> <s> he explained the thinking behind flagging possible amendments in committee which i believe is contained in standing orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point but i stated what the white paper said <e> <s> it made clear that the resources would have to come from somewhere <e> <s> in the absence of any suggestions the government produced their own proposals <e> <s> the proposals are in the i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords white papers take a little time to produce and it is not possible to anticipate all the reactions <e> <s> however i am saying so now and i hope that that will satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> of course it will not but i am trying <e>", "<cs> my lords the specific negotiations to which my noble friend referred have indeed started in the past five days <e> <s> the more general ones have been going on for some time <e> <s> so to an extent i think my noble friend would agree that we were both right <e> <s> but i am not sure that that gets us very much further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the noble baroness has a special interest in this field <e> <s> she has written to me about it and i am following up the cases which she quoted <e> <s> i can advise her that the department has recently completed consultations on a draft circular on the discharge of patients from hospital in which health authorities were reminded to make suitable plans for the discharge of patients including arrangements for transfer to other facilities at an early stage of the patients stay in hospital <e> <s> it points out the need to involve patients and their relatives or carers in such plans <e> <s> i said that consultations had recently been completed <e> <s> the results are now being considered and the circular should be issued quite shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the report because i have not seen it <e> <s> i can advise <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that we are <e> <s> if i may go back to the original question i was asked about those patients with permanent disabilities who are being discharged from hospital <e> <s> there are a comparatively small number <e> <s> we are talking about patients a year <e> <s> in the latest year for which statistics are available a fair number of buildings were adapted <e> <s> further i can say that dwellings now provide standard amenities suitable for disabled people where the existing amenities were not accessible by reason of their disability <e> <s> quite a lot is going on in that area <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most certainly <e> <s> it may help my noble friend to know that the department of the environment recently published a helpful handbook entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords as in other areas i accept that performance is patchy <e> <s> the governments objective is to bring the worst up to the level of the best <e> <s> the government are encouraging local authorities along those lines <e>", "<cs> yes my lords to both supplementary questions <e> <s> in answer to the first that is exactly why we are preparing this circular advising early consultation between the patient the relative the clinical team and the local authorities <e> <s> that is important <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the chronically sick and disabled persons act <e> <s> discussions are going on and i hope to be able to make an announcement on section in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals makes an interesting point but i rather believe that it is wide of the subject on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will need to read the <e>", "<cs> my lords people with mental illness are not regarded as having permanent disabilities <e> <s> i would accept that people with mental handicaps might well fit <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords but the noble lord asked me about mental illness and mentally handicapped patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise because i misheard <e> <s> certainly mental illness does fall outside this question <e> <s> i have announced what the government are doing in the area of mentally handicapped and physically handicapped patients <e> <s> if the noble lord has a more specific supplementary question i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness has caught me on the hop <e> <s> i shall have to write to her on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> indeed there are halfway houses which are already in use in connection with some hospitals <e> <s> however i agree that a great deal more could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said some four and a half hours ago it is a measure of how important the house considers the subject of medical research that so many noble lords have spoken <e> <s> although i asked questions about the role and format of the new authority suggested by the select committee and did not intend i can tell the noble lord lord sherfield to do more than that i was impressed by the fact that whether or not your lordships were members of the select committee to a peer your lordships told me that the new research authority was the right way ahead for the national health service <e> <s> i find that extremely impressive advice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord not for the first time has pre-empted me <e> <s> i was about to <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the social security act which is the one to which the noble baroness referred sits squarely within existing law <e> <s> therefore no practical purpose would be served by bringing the section into effect <e> <s> that being so the government have no plans for laying a commencement order on section of the act <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can <e> <s> the explanation is that there is already an obligation under section of the act to review the level of child benefit each year but not at any one specific date <e> <s> in practice it is obviously sensible to conduct the review at the same time as the review of other benefits in the autumn <e> <s> a review in april would be unhelpful as there would be a full year before the next uprating would take effect <e>", "<cs> my lords it is more than not convenient it is not logical because child benefit affects other social security benefits <e> <s> if we change one we must change the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble lord understands the point full well <e> <s> i remind him that the laying of the commencement order is a matter for the government <e> <s> it always has been and i suspect that it always will be <e>", "<cs> my lords we are continuing to examine the options for improving the national health service and will be bringing forward our proposals in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords not only has the role of support staff been appraised and recognised by the bodies to which the noble lord refers it has also been recognised by the government <e> <s> i say again today that the health service would not function without the loyal support of the support staff <e> <s> as to what will happen when there is a resolution of the review my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services has made it clear that parliament will be informed but that he cannot say what supporting documentation will be around at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why the noble lord finds the matter bewildering <e> <s> incidentally i agree totally with the premise upon which he based his question <e> <s> however as far as i know no decisions on publication are ever made by any government anywhere in the world until after they have decided what is to go into such a presumed publication <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i accept my noble friends comments on that matter <e> <s> that is why we intend to get on with the review <e> <s> equally it is such an important subject that we do not intend to rush the review <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has to my knowledge been extremely careful about what he has said <e> <s> the fact that the press has read far more into what he said has obviously confused the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear that the noble lord heard my right honourable friends speech <e> <s> i must confess that i did not but i read it <e> <s> i have read all his speeches on this subject extremely carefully <e> <s> i do not believe that he made the type of suggestions which the noble lord has attributed to him <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> one of the reasons why i agree is that if one compares the percentage of gdp spent on health in this country with that spent in the other industrialised nations one will find that the extra health care finance provided is to a great extent made up by the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that he did not refer to it <e> <s> he has been referring as have i and my colleagues to the various suggestions that are in the public domain which often come from worthy individuals and public bodies <e> <s> if there is a debate clearly one must take notice of the points made in that debate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have made clear on numerous occasions the review is more general than the noble lord lord molloy seems to think <e> <s> it will have an effect if it goes through as we all expect on each individual branch and part of the health service <e> <s> nonetheless it is difficult to see what effect it will have on chiropodists general practitioners or others <e>", "<cs> my lords i aceept on behalf of the government that the number of homeless people is indeed greater in london <e> <s> in the last quarter per cent <e> <s> of those accepted as homeless were mentally ill compared with per cent <e> <s> in the non-metropolitan districts <e> <s> there has been a slight increase over the first quarter of last year when per cent <e> <s> of those households accepted as homeless were vulnerable due to mental illness compared with per cent <e> <s> this year <e> <s> the figures for london are likely to be double those that i have just mentioned which are for england as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has asked two questions <e> <s> one concerns the identification of this most unfortunate group of people <e> <s> local government statistics and indeed health authority statistics have to be precise <e> <s> they cover that group which has been identified as mentally ill <e> <s> the difficulty with some of the figures from other authoritative sources in this area is that there is no means of telling whether or not they relate to people who are identifiably ill <e> <s> i shall certainly bring the noble lords words to the attention of health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot tell the noble baroness when there will be a government statement on the griffiths report for the simple reason that i do not yet know <e> <s> when i know i shall of course inform not only the noble baroness but the house as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have researched this area fairly extensively as the noble lord will know from recent experience and also from past experience <e> <s> from time to time our attention is drawn to the cases of people who have been discharged from long stay hospitals and are if the noble lord will pardon the expression floating in the community <e> <s> we have always tracked down those cases and found that that is not the case <e> <s> the problem arises with people who have had short-term treatment in acute psychiatric hospitals from which it is not unnatural to suppose that they should go back to the kind of living standards from which they came <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have those figures with me at the moment but i shall write to the noble lord if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of the report but i have to confess that i have not yet read it <e> <s> i understand that it is very recent <e> <s> i shall certainly be looking into it <e> <s> i made the point earlier that there has been an increase and that the government are aware of that <e> <s> i said i believe to the noble baroness lady seear that resources have not yet caught up with that increase <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i should like to think further about the noble lords very valuable suggestion <e> <s> it is a fact that central government and the health authorities are concentrating many of their resources into funding the voluntary bodies which are working so successfully in this area <e> <s> having said that i shall certainly investigate the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in recent weeks there have been discussions on this very worrying subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course pass on the remarks of the noble lord to my right honourable friend <e> <s> in so doing i shall have to tell him that from the remarks that the noble lord has made it is likely that he will be a strong supporter of the governments current housing bill which has such an end in view <e>", "<cs> my lords we are consulting at the moment on just that subject <e> <s> our concern about the advertising of any type of personal pension scheme has always centred on ensuring that projections of future benefits are not misleading <e> <s> when the social security act was going through parliament the government made it clear that that was the principal intended use of the power being taken to control pension scheme advertisements <e> <s> under the financial services act the advertising rules are designed to embrace a much wider range of products than personal pensions and as a result are more wide-ranging <e> <s> however i should stress that the present proposals are consultative <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as concerns general advice department of health and social security offices have copies of a booklet entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords the krner system will indeed be considerably more authoritative and also faster because of computerisation <e> <s> the computerisation has been delayed by about a year for the proving of the software package which is why matters are not so far advanced as the government would like <e> <s> on changes in statistics i cannot give a reason for hospital theatre statistics being changed <e> <s> however statistics in most cases have to be revalued <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me the details of that exchange in your lordships house <e> <s> however now that it has been drawn to my attention i shall look into it and apologise in writing to the surgeon concerned if i find that it is necessary <e> <s> however the important factor is the services to patients and whether we are becoming a healthier or a sicker nation as a result of the changes that have been taking place in the health service <e> <s> i have a whole raft of examples on that but the most telling one is that the expectation of life for both males and females is now over four years more at birth than it was in the s and two years more at birth than it was in the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also a longer experience and expectancy of life among the elderly <e> <s> the number of hip replacement operations has almost doubled since as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords consultants decisions on admission to hospital are based on their clinical judgment <e> <s> each case will be treated as individual <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that people in emergency should be treated somewhere <e> <s> it depends how one classifies emergency <e> <s> if one means by emergency within hours i believe that this is always achieved <e> <s> there have indeed been closures of beds for a number of reasons <e> <s> we have discussed this a number of times over the past months in this chamber <e> <s> however i have also pointed out that the number of cases treated and operations conducted has consistently risen over recent years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am very surprised on two counts <e> <s> first i regard myself standing at this dispatch box as a rather tired statistic <e> <s> secondly because in his discovery i am surprised that the noble lord did not achieve understanding of the fact that in spite of the closures to which he referred even in that district health authority the number of cases treated has gone up as in other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they must depend on ruling circumstances but clinical judgment forms the major part of all decisions on admission to hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not guarantee that every treatment possible in the world is available in this country <e> <s> there are some treatments which the medical establishment here treats with a certain amount of suspicion <e> <s> therefore it is hardly surprising that if people are determined to have a particular treatment which they cannot have here they raise funds both privately and publicly to send their relatives or indeed themselves to other parts of the world to be treated <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have not read it <e> <s> yes i shall certainly write to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that that is the proper role of government <e> <s> rationing in the health service in certain areas has existed for many years <e> <s> an example of such rationing is the waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i only add that i am alive today purely because of the good services of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords it ill behoves a member of your lordships house or indeed of another place speaking from the opposition benches to use words such as deplorable about pensioners incomes <e> <s> it is the change in pensioners total incomes which counts and not the rate of basic pension <e> <s> the government do not intend indeed no government have ever intended pensions to be the whole of pensioners incomes <e> <s> so far as pensioners total incomes are concerned between and they have risen on average by per cent <e> <s> a year <e> <s> we should compare that with the period between and when they rose by only per cent <e> <s> a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think fairness comes into it <e>", "<cs> today my lords a couple with no other income will typically receive total state help of a week through income support and housing benefit including having all their rent paid where appropriate <e> <s> the family expenditure survey shows that average weekly expenditure by pensioners is less than their weekly income <e> <s> i believe that is what matters <e>", "<cs> no my lords of course it does not <e> <s> it comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is right to the extent that a retirement pension is a contributory benefit <e> <s> there are other social security benefits which make the level up to the a week to which i referred earlier <e> <s> the state pension is one thing the total income going into pensioner households is quite different which is a fact that obviously the noble earl has grasped <e>", "<cs> my lords the social security changes have meant that the situation for widows has indeed changed as the likelihood of their remarriage has changed <e> <s> but with respect i suggest that that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it very hard that i am accused of not showing compassion <e> <s> what i have done is to explain to the noble lord and to the house generally that it is the total level of pensioners incomes which matters <e> <s> if he regards the record of the labour party as exemplary when during that period it poured money into the pockets of those who did not really need it he is entitled to his view <e>", "<cs> my lords most certainly we shall look at the funds proposals as we shall look at all representations made to us about the scheme <e> <s> in our broader consideration of the health authoritys proposals the sort of issues ministers will need to consider include the implications for patients as the noble lord would suspect the building proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely interested in what my noble friend has to say on this matter <e> <s> i should perhaps have added in answer to the noble lord lord ennals that implications for patients means wherever they happen to reside either permanently or temporarily within the district health authoritys area <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is an interesting point of view <e> <s> i am not aware of any evidence to suggest that in the day-time or indeed the night-time population of the westminster area there is a higher incidence of spectacularly violent and unpredictable disease than in other parts of london but i will certainly check that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have discussed residential accommodation for nurses at various times in this chamber over the past few years <e> <s> i am very much aware of the problem especially as it applies to london <e> <s> obviously i must be careful in what i say but the closeness of any hospital to its nurses accommodation would be a factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that undertaking <e> <s> however i shall certainly put the point to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last two-thirds of the comments addressed to me by the noble lord i note what he said <e> <s> however i should not wish to comment upon them at this moment <e> <s> with reference to the first point raised by the noble lord he regularly chides me for not producing the governments reaction to reports quickly enough and i note his change of view on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords again i note what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords through the health education council as it then was a useful leaflet of advice to parents on the misuse of glue and other solvents was published in i think <e> <s> since then we have had consultations on involving parents further through doctors surgeries post offices and other places where parents tend to gather <e> <s> we are considering reissuing such a leaflet <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be brave for anyone to suggest that the dangers have started to decrease because this is a very serious problem <e> <s> in of the deaths associated with solvent misuse were deaths directly associated with gas fuels <e> <s> however i emphasise that the figures must be <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is the crux of the problem <e> <s> the evil to which the noble baroness lady masham has drawn attention has perfectly proper uses <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to the noble lord lord ennals the statistics to which i adverted must be taken with a large pinch of salt because they depend on efficient and accurate reporting <e> <s> whether or not it is possible to have more accurate figures i do not know but i will certainly look at the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is yes <e> <s> that is why we are considering ways in which to republish the advice leaflet for parents <e> <s> of course during biological studies in schools teachers draw attention to the dangers of sniffing solvents and gas fuels <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not run hospitals <e> <s> we have no place and no wish to intervene in their day-to-day management which is quite properly the responsibility of health authorities <e> <s> the government provide funds to the health authorities which are for them to manage according to local needs and priorities <e> <s> these funds have increased in real terms in each year since this government took office <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question yesterday i was very proud and privileged to be at a party at the invitation of my right honourable friend to celebrate the th anniversary of the national health service held at the queen elizabeth ii conference centre <e> <s> among the guests were people who had served continuously in the health service at various levels from ordinary nurses and community staff right the way up to family practitioner committee members and others <e> <s> they had been working in health care before the health service came into existence <e> <s> i certainly associate myself with the comments made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view with which i totally agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how to answer that question <e> <s> i am responsible only for my answers and not for noble lords questions <e> <s> i note that from may to the end of hospitals were approved for closure at the rate of each year compared with each year when the labour government were in office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i can <e> <s> however my noble friend lord arran told the house on friday that the number of beds fell by in the period and by a further to date <e> <s> i hope that that helps the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said time and again from this dispatch box the governments responsibility is for the totality of services <e> <s> i cannot guarantee that a particular bed will be found in a particular hospital at a particular time for a particular case <e> <s> however looking at the global picture since in-patient treatments have increased by per cent <e> <s> out-patient treatments by per cent <e> <s> and day-care treatments by per cent <e> <s> certainly for day-to-day treatments one does not normally need beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to comment specifically on that case <e> <s> but more generally overspending is often the result of increased activity that was unplanned earlier in the year <e> <s> the government have made it clear to health authority chairmen that we expect measures to restrict overspending to be taken so far as possible in areas that do not directly affect patient care <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the details underlying the noble lords question but i am aware that of those years only one third of them were under the administration of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that last remark of my noble and learned friend was made to correct impressions given by the noble lord or to correct something i said in response <e> <s> however i shall guarantee to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly join in both those sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords it would ill behove me to respond on behalf of the government to a report that has only just been published <e> <s> we shall of course study it and respond by command paper in the usual way <e> <s> the report i referred to was an interim report headed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also aware that the whitley awards have not yet been settled whereas the nurses awards were settled earlier this year and were responded to in full <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the reason is that we did not then have the opposition we have now namely the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to both the noble lord lord ennals and the noble baroness lady seear for their sympathetic and understanding reception of this report on such a serious matter <e> <s> i note that they join me in expressing our thanks and admiration to lord justice butler-sloss and her assessors for the thorough and authoritative report that they have produced <e> <s> i believe that it is incumbent upon us now to ensure that the lessons to be drawn from the mistakes made in cleveland are applied urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend but the initial responses of the government to the report as regards training are to be found in the document <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with the noble viscount in everything that he has said <e> <s> of course the structure of the family is fundamental to society in this country and the government will do all in their power to keep it that way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the report that the problems in cleveland were failures in practice <e> <s> while i acknowledge some weaknesses in correct child care law i do not believe that this was the cause of the cleveland events <e> <s> with the best will in the world legislation cannot ensure good practice <e> <s> however the current legislation and the guidance published today provide a sound framework for good practice <e> <s> when my noble friend studies the report she will find that the learned judge makes reference to the limited knowledge of and access to the law <e> <s> when the bill comes forward i understand my noble friend will look critically at the financial and introductory memorandum <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that in the circumstances that is a particularly fair response <e> <s> the moment that this catastrophic situation came to light my right honourable friend the secretary of state decided to set up this inquiry <e> <s> the moment that the report was received we had arrangements made for it to be printed and presented to both houses at the earliest possible opportunity <e> <s> during this time the various publications to which i have referred were prepared and are being issued today <e> <s> on this occasion at least <e> <s> i do not think that comment can be made upon the laxity of government effort <e>", "<cs> my lords quite certainly one cannot live without them <e> <s> having said that the reason for the campaign is the horrifyingly high incidence of heart disease leading to serious operations and ultimately to death <e> <s> i can advise my noble friend that from the outset both the confederation of british industry and the trades union congress have supported the campaign <e> <s> industry commerce and the workplace have been encouraged to join the campaign by signing the look after your heart contract <e> <s> i would only add <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the most heartful government i can remember <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently undergoing a consultation exercise which will lead to the second stage of the look after your heart campaign <e> <s> if the organisation of the noble lord or indeed any others wish to put in papers to that campaign they will be gratefully received <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent weeks and indeed over the next five days or so we shall be discussing at length the primary health care white paper and the possibility of training doctors community nurses and other adjuncts to surgeries to do various things <e> <s> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> looking at page of the document to which he referred i must correct him in one material fact <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very good working hypothesis but i am sure that one could add to those rules <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge research being evaluated suggests the findings that the noble countess has referred to <e> <s> in the health education authorities advice leaflets on the subject that is pointed out <e> <s> however so far as i know it has not been confirmed <e>", "<cs> i said earlier that circumstances have changed since when my right honourable friend the then minister for health made his comments <e> <s> not only have the economic circumstances of the country changed but there was a further review in carried out by hambros bank and the government have now taken the view that the corporation can and should survive and prosper in the private sector <e>", "<cs> i understand that in these three amendments nos <e> <s> and both noble lords are seeking reassurances on what is meant by the various parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the national interest <e> <s> the purpose of that subsection is to deal with a problem that could arise concerning the successor companys borrowing during a possible interim period between vesting and sale <e> <s> between establishing the company and the sale of it there might be circumstances where the public interest would override that of the company and the secretary of state may wish to exercise his powers in accordance with the former <e> <s> an example would be where although increased borrowing by the company might be beneficial to it it would be undesirable on grounds of public policy <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friend lord trafford is absolutely right <e> <s> clause is entirely the intermediate stage as i described it earlier of the gpfc in other words while it is still in the public sector but is already on its way to being privatised so to speak and that should be for a very short period indeed <e>", "<cs> once the corporation is in private hands as it were the directors will be at the disposition of the shareholders whoever they may be so no guarantees can be given on that score in the long term <e> <s> as i said in the interim period there will be representatives or nominations of the general medical services council on the board <e>", "<cs> obviously i cannot guarantee that no jobs will be lost <e> <s> the new schedule ensures that the contract for a particular job is handed

winstanley <e> <s> the duty which the amendment seeks to place upon the corporation while it is in its current form and while it is in what i call its intermediary form is already imposed in law under section of the national health service act <e> <s> at those moments it is therefore not required <e>", "<cs> when large private corporations get into trouble debate is indeed raised either in this chamber or another place from time to time <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent will no doubt know that even better than i however i take my noble friends point on the interest of members of both places in the matter <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i misunderstood my noble friend <e> <s> when he referred to people who are employed in the company i thought he meant the people employed in the gpfc but obviously he did not <e>", "<cs> i said to my noble friend lord nugent unless i am very much mistaken that i shall of course take this matter away and look at it <e> <s> i am not sure what guarantees i can give but it occurs to me literally off the top of my head that we might be able to do something through the articles of association <e> <s> that is only a first thought <e> <s> i shall consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> this has been a substantial debate on what is obviously a serious subject that much concerns the committee <e> <s> i must admit that at one point i was wondering whether j r tolkien wrote <e>", "<cs> i think that there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding in all this <e> <s> if noble lords would like to look at line at the beginning of clause they will find that the first line curtails the rest of the clause <e>", "<cs> if i am allowed to develop my argument perhaps we may get a little further forward <e> <s> the point about paragraph g is that it does not give power to reorganise the health service as the noble lord lord ennals suggested <e> <s> the wording is similar to that already contained in section b of the national health service act under which the secretary of state can and i almost quote do anything whatsoever which is calculated to facilitate or is conducive or incidental to the discharge of his duty to provide the health service <e> <s> in other words the clause in the existing legislation is a belt and braces clause and it is a belt and braces clause which paragraph g is also intended to provide <e> <s> there is nothing sinister in it at all <e>", "<cs> if that was supposed to be a suggestion that i am hinting that members of the committee should belt up i am not doing anything of the sort <e> <s> i was trying to explain to the noble lord that paragraph g is not unusual <e> <s> when legislation confers powers to carry out certain activities every situation that might arise in the exercise of those powers obviously cannot be foreseen <e> <s> it therefore makes sense to give powers to do anything incidental to the activities with which the legislation is principally concerned as as i said earlier is shown by section of the national health service act <e>", "<cs> i think that i would have to take legal advice on that question <e> <s> i cannot imagine that there would be many takers for some secretaries of state in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perfectly entitled to divide the committee over words which were used in his own legislation which was introduced when he was secretary of state <e> <s> he may well find that they are not pertinent today <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i shall certainly think about it <e> <s> however it can only do my case justice to point out that section of the national health service act states <e>", "<cs> i must correct that straight away <e> <s> i said that if the league of friends did not provide the trolley and the health service decided to do so it would be the health service that would not be allowed to charge p <e> <s> or whatever it is for the yorkie <e>", "<cs> this is an extremely complicated matter and i hope that i can explain it to the noble lords satisfaction <e> <s> if not i suggest that we have consultations between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> no i was trying to point out to the noble lord that the amendment is unnecessary because clause does not cover community health councils <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may be my guest <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both noble lords <e>", "<cs> i have never before had to ask a question of members of the committee but perhaps i may ask whether they are satisfied with the situation which pertains at the moment <e> <s> my answer will differ as to whether or not they are <e>", "<cs> what i meant was that the secretary of state already has powers under section of the national health service act to use private beds for public purposes should he need to do so <e> <s> these powers are extended by section ii of the health services act <e>", "<cs> subsection introduces a new section to the national health service act <e> <s> the point at issue is that the secretary of state must be satisfied that the existence of pay beds does not prejudice the carrying out of public services and to an extent vice versa <e> <s> he has to keep a balance within a given hospital where pay beds are authorised <e>", "<cs> yes obviously if one side robs beds from the other and the situation changes the imbalance must he corrected <e> <s> the words at issue with the noble lord lord prys-davies are to a significant extent <e> <s> to accept the formulation preferred by the noble lord of interference in any way removes discretion from the secretary of state <e> <s> in order to keep a balance and correct imbalances discretion continues to be needed <e> <s> that is why i do not like the formulation proposed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes the underlying message is certainly acceptable to the government <e> <s> i have more difficulty with whether it should be incorporated in the bill and i shall explain why to the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace of coslany was alone among those who spoke at second reading in confining his remarks to clause <e> <s> i note that he feels so deeply about this subject that this is the first time he has uttered today <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given me the opportunity to speak again <e>", "<cs> it goes without saying that we need standards <e> <s> i rather doubt that we need another statutory committee <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity to repeat assurances given in another place that there are adequate safeguards contained in clause to ensure that nothing may be done which affects adversely the duties of the secretary of state under the act <e> <s> as i explained earlier this afternoon that has absolutely nothing to do with either local or community health councils <e> <s> therefore the noble lord lord winstanley may strike that matter from his memory <e> <s> that is to be found in clause and under the new section which for scotland is section <e>", "<cs> since this matter was first raised with me by the noble lord lord prys-davies before second reading a good deal of unanimity seems to have broken out around this clause <e> <s> noble lords may be relieved to hear that although i do not believe that it is yet complete we are certainly getting there <e> <s> i believe that we are unanimous in welcoming the dramatic improvements in the dental health of the country particularly among children <e> <s> i have disgraceful teeth myself with a large number of fillings which were needed when i was at a much younger age than are my two children now and i am well aware of the enormous improvement achieved in the dental health of children by dentists under the national health service which the noble lord lord winstanley has pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i read the second leader in <e>", "<cs> my lords that was what i meant <e> <s> authorities should be pressing ahead with the development of the services already planned rather than postponing developments pending national action <e> <s> while it is not necessary to have the is dotted and the ts crossed in respect of both considerations clearly it is necessary for them to be in parallel <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i do not believe that that conclusion can be drawn <e> <s> care in the community means more than merely keeping people in their own homes as the noble lord well knows <e> <s> where considered appropriate there is provision within the care in the community policy for residential homes and hostels of various kinds <e>", "<cs> my lords that has no bearing on the matter <e> <s> sir roy griffiths was asked to report on suggestions for improving the situation within current resources and he did so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> however we in central government have no evidence of that allegation <e> <s> if the noble lord can produce the evidence i shall willingly look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has asked a very precise and detailed question <e> <s> i should like to consider the matter and write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier that both local authorities and district health authorities should get on with the plans which they have already formulated <e> <s> whenever the result of the governments consideration on the report of sir roy griffiths appears i do not see that that makes any difference to that aspect <e> <s> nor should it be suggested that sir roys report is being shelved because it acknowledges the need for further work in the absence of an obviously perfect solution <e> <s> the framework which sir roy has offered needs to be studied before decisions can be reached on the best way forward but that does not preclude current action <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that there is room for progress within the existing arrangements <e>", "<cs> i recognise who would not after our short debate <e> <s> that the issue of charging for dental and optical services is the most controversial issue in the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may add a reason for that which has not been adduced by the proposers and supporters of the amendment <e> <s> when people have grown up over two generations with a free service it comes hard to them to find that those services must be paid for <e> <s> however this is a transitory matter <e> <s> charges were introduced in and at other times in the past <e> <s> in those cases there was a short period of decline of take-up and then the situation righted itself <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall return to that point in just a second <e> <s> obviously it is a very real and very valid point <e> <s> i would say for the moment that we are not comparing charges for dental inspections with prescription charges <e> <s> we should be comparing them with the charges for dental treatment which are rather different <e> <s> i have told the committee that the new charge for the inspection will he made on exactly the same basis as the existing charges for treatment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that one can have a perpendicular parallel <e> <s> i did not refer to the point because i thought that my noble friend lord trafford had dealt with it very well when he spoke about the cost effectiveness of screening <e> <s> with the very small number to which i referred it simply is not sensible to set up a detailed screening system comparable for example with breast cancer or cervical smear screening <e> <s> i do not regard this opportunistic form of screening as conventional screening <e> <s> i referred to it earlier as better identification of a wide range of conditions that might have oral symptoms <e> <s> this is something that we want to develop across the primary care services generally and intend to pursue through our discussions on the white paper <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord trafford and i between us have answered the point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is trying to compare two quite separate things <e> <s> there have never been charges for screening and we are not proposing charges for screening now <e> <s> as i said in answer to the <e>", "<cs> we are talking not about savings but about the expected extra expenditure of around million on the primary health care services over the next three years as i have now said several times <e> <s> the money has to come from somewhere <e> <s> the government have concluded that the time is now right for a small proportion of it to come from charging for dental inspections <e>", "<cs> as has been explained screening is where one has a system of call and recall aimed at per cent <e> <s> of a target population <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord ennals would agree with that <e> <s> under the existing or proposed system in no way could that definition be given to the activities of dentists carrying out dental inspections <e>", "<cs> i fully understand my noble friends intention in moving this amendment <e> <s> it is to remove from the national health service act and its scottish equivalent a regulation-making power under which a long-standing provision has been made enabling a dentist to supply under the national health service at the patients request a denture bridge crown gold filling or inlay of a type more expensive than the dentist considers clinically necessary the patient paying the excess cost in full <e> <s> the main advantage of the scheme is that it enables patients to top up out of their own pockets what the nhs is prepared to provide by paying the extra cost of an item which goes beyond what is needed for the strict purposes of dental fitness <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the dilemma in which my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth finds himself in moving this amendment <e> <s> it is paralleled by my own dilemma to an extent in responding to it <e> <s> i would argue that irrespective of the arguments for and against charges for teeth inspection the detail of the health arguments for charging for eye examinations is quite different <e>", "<cs> as i understand it amendments nos <e> <s> and fall to be discussed <e>", "<cs> i obviously have nothing to say as this is linked to the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall put the governments view on this amendment before the committee <e> <s> clearly the arguments on both sides of this particular amendment run thick and fast <e> <s> in the circumstances the government wish to be guided by the views of the committee on whether the prescription requirement should be retained or not <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a very brief word <e> <s> although clearly we have lost the meat of the clause it contains other important features <e> <s> it will enable us to extend the spectacle voucher scheme it will enable us to make payments for the cost of repairing or replacing spectacles for children and the handicapped <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will consider that a welcome extension of the scheme <e> <s> for that reason i should like to see the clause remain part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend gave me a few days warning of his question and i have been able to look into it <e>", "<cs> i assure the committee that there is no ulterior motive here <e> <s> the requirements that the amendment seeks to remove are not intended in any way as a slight to the profession they are simply part of our measures to help the consumer <e> <s> i do not think it unreasonable that patients should be given written confirmation that the practitioner has carried out the eye examination required by regulation <e>", "<cs> clearly this is one of the considerations between now and the next stage of the bill <e> <s> however as i said earlier it is not the only consideration <e>", "<cs> the cash-limiting provisions the noble lord was good enough to say he was not against them in principle that we seek in this clause have very positive advantages in targeting resources where they are most needed to improve patient care <e> <s> the clause will enable the government first to remove a number of central constraints on the greater use of practice team staff and second to improve surgery premises <e> <s> however the source of funds is as usual not a bottomless purse <e> <s> the greater local flexibility we are aiming to create must be balanced by a central mechanism for controlling the expenditure <e> <s> otherwise one practice might well be very highly staffed whereas another practice not <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the committee and the noble lord <e> <s> at the beginning of the first day in committee last thursday we dealt with amendments nos <e> <s> to as a group <e> <s> in a sense <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree that a wise consumer carries around a prescription for his current pair of glasses or contact lenses or whatever in his handbag or rather in her handbag or his wallet <e> <s> the noble lord laughs but it is not beyond the wit of man that even in england a man may carry a handbag <e> <s> i know several who do although i do not actually do it myself <e> <s> having said that i am advised that there is no legal right for a prescription for contact lenses <e> <s> clearly i shall have to consider this because this amendment brings the matter to my attention for the first time <e> <s> i was rather surprised and thought it likely to indicate quite a different line of questioning <e> <s> since i find that it has not perhaps i can get back to the noble lord before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> as long as there is no suggestion from the noble lord lord ennals that we should end up throwing them at each other yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why the noble countess regards the carrying out of the exercise as unclear when guidance to health authorities was issued on the subject by my department <e> <s> i am well aware of suggestions that the funding may and i stress the word may be inadequate <e> <s> i advise her that no region has given detailed consideration to even preliminary figures from all their districts so it is totally unprofitable to speculate <e> <s> i know that the noble countess has a particular interest in the west midlands <e> <s> this morning i was advised that no district in the west midlands has yet submitted detailed regrading proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords there is absolutely no question that the extra million to which i referred in my initial answer will be curtailed in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no intention to undermine the good that has been done and that is why i was absolutely firm in my answer to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> we believe that the assumptions which underlie the review bodys estimate of the costs of the award are reasonable <e> <s> clearly the review body thought so otherwise it would not have recommended the award in the first place <e> <s> it provides - per cent <e> <s> extra in the total pay bill <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is exactly the reason why the government accepted the review body award <e> <s> of course there are two problems first in certain specialities nurses are leaving the profession secondly for demographic reasons they are not entering the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords there is absolutely no question of a parliamentary or any other commitment being breached <e> <s> the full-year costs of the award will be million in the united kingdom <e> <s> that money is already provided for and that money will be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained earlier i have already done so <e> <s> i came to the conclusion that it is too early to predict the outcome of the clinical grading review <e> <s> as i said earlier no region has given detailed consideration even to preliminary figures from all its districts <e> <s> therefore it must be totally unprofitable to speculate on the outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i shall look at any authoritative source including that of my right honourable friend the prime minister in this or any other area <e> <s> what she has said she has said what i have said to your lordships this afternoon i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords while we share the concern that has been expressed over the prescribing of benzodiazepines we believe that such concerns are best addressed by the medical profession in the first instance <e> <s> that is why the government are determined that the chief medical officer should hold discussions with the relevant professional bodies about the prescribing of these drugs <e> <s> we must get this matter into proportion <e> <s> there are several medical conditions for which these drugs are appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in my noble friends remarks <e> <s> she is of course right <e> <s> the dhss funds the distribution to doctors of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that these drugs are not always addictive <e> <s> however having said that i go along with what the noble lord lord ennals said <e> <s> i firmly believe that it would be inappropriate to ban benzodiazepines <e> <s> they are clinically useful for patients suffering from anxiety or insomnia

merely reinforcing his non-suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that all these matters will be raised by the chief medical officer at the talks to which i have referred <e> <s> we and the medical profession are anxious to control the level of repeat prescribing and i believe that to be generally welcomed throughout your lordships house <e> <s> many doctors recognise the need for a regular review of repeat prescriptions and they operate their own control systems <e> <s> the health departments already monitor instances of prescribing that seem to be excessive using information from the prescription pricing authorities <e> <s> discussions with the profession are taking place about how information concerning repeat prescribing can be improved <e> <s> this will enable doctors to exercise a greater level of control <e> <s> i stress that this is principally a problem for the doctors <e> <s> we will do everything in our power to help <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to illustrate earlier that is not always appropriate <e> <s> the number of prescriptions for drugs dispensed by community pharmacists in great britain shows a steady decline <e> <s> from a peak of million in the number of prescriptions has fallen to about million in <e> <s> pressure is continuing on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would be wise to reserve my answer to the noble lords question until such time as the government publish their response to the select committees report on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can say is that the department of health will continue to fund research at broadly the same level of expenditure at the new unit <e> <s> i recognise that primary care and the work of general practitioners is of vital and growing importance in the mental health field as the noble lord said <e> <s> indeed the unit itself recognises that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to hear the noble lords introductory comments <e> <s> when i said earlier that i expected the department of healths support to continue at broadly the same level the figure i referred to was per year <e> <s> more generally however the research will have to be discussed with the new director when he is appointed but i must point out that he is currently in the final stages of selection <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall refer the matter both to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health and also to my honourable friend the minister for health because i am aware of the concern of your lordships in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a cast iron guarantee but it expected that it will continue to be at the institute of psychiatry <e>", "<cs> my lords the krner data on which the report will be based are delayed as i told

area <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are other professions supplementary to medicine which also have this effect <e> <s> but i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i am aware of the figures that the noble lord has mentioned to the house in his supplementary question <e> <s> however i repeat that while the government are not complacent the regional health authorities

heard an amendment with a similar effect to the one before us was put down at report stage in another place <e> <s> it is important for me to say at the outset that we believe it essential that health authorities make every effort to involve the public in the management and planning of their local health service <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals and i would not disagree on that <e> <s> i also

what both noble lords have said <e> <s> i can only thank them very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble countess is quite right <e> <s> the change of circumstance rules governing the rate of

countess very kindly tipped me off about different ways of paying those benefits <e> <s> i have had them investigated and i cannot see that it is possible either under the new or the old system for there to be different ways <e> <s> however there are different rules for calculating the weekly amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not believe it does because if a person is in respite care for a very short period he will be eligible for all the social security benefits which he was receiving while at home <e> <s> as regards the weekly payments either in arrears or in advance i believe that it is all a question of swings and roundabouts <e> <s> some people will benefit from the new rules if they are paid in arrears and are in a hostel for only the last day of their benefit week because they will receive benefit at the hostel rate for the whole week <e> <s> therefore there are rather more gainers than losers in all this <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the rules and the administration

offices have been very well trained <e> <s> i know that the noble countess has said that there are some glaring alternatives to this particular statement and she will presumably be letting me know where she knows of such glaring errors <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall most certainly look at the matter but my current advice is that to put people who are to go into board and lodgings and hostels on to a daily basis would far from simplifying matters make them a lot more complicated <e> <s> i repeat what i said about the difference between hostel and board and lodging arrangements and the residential care and nursing homes arrangements which are quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed seen the reports in the newspapers today of the cpags report but i should advise the noble lord that that is rather a different question from the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords not surprisingly we have had a large number of responses and we intend to make a decision on the consultative paper known shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords until the noble lord lord swann spoke i had the impression that i was being damned all round the house with faint praise <e> <s> i was going to say that i should have to be satisfied with that <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord welcomes my intention to write to the committee of vice-chancellors and principals <e> <s> i promised him earlier that this was what i should do <e> <s> it is what the committee would like and i undertake to have that commitment fulfilled as i said earlier <e> <s> certainly i shall make sure that copies of that letter go to all noble lords who have spoken both in the short debate now and when we were considering this subject on report <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i have always regarded any letter published or not that i write to any member of your lordships house or on your lordships behalf to organisations in which noble lords are interested as public property <e> <s> therefore i am very happy to have the letter circulated as widely as noble lords wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether that last remark was a reference yet again to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> even if it had been a contract of the nhs and the secretary of state for social services years ago it would have been under the old contract and i suspect that this debate would not have taken place <e> <s> perhaps we may therefore temporarily ignore the noble lord lord adrian <e>", "<cs> my lords it comes as no surprise to your lordships that i welcome this amendment <e> <s> it is a refinement of one moved at report by my noble friend which was designed to ensure that researchers and academic institutions that have a legitimate interest are properly rewarded when the products of their labour are developed for monetary gain for the greater good of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> this bill was introduced in another place getting on for a year ago on the same day as my right honourable friend the then minister for health announced the publication of the governments white paper on primary health care <e>",

reactions to this statement <e> <s> kinder things <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord lord kilmarnock to some of the answers i gave to the noble baroness and the noble lord opposite just now <e> <s> however i would point out that child benefit is paid without a means test to all who have children and that is totally consistent with the manifesto commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house would do well to note the points made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he and i clearly belong to that great body of thoughtful opinion as he calls it who are unrepentent targeters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should he delighted to explain myself <e> <s> it said the same thing twice <e>", "<cs> no not the amendment my lords <e> <s> the statute book now says the same thing twice but in slightly different forms <e> <s> the original act commits the secretary of state to review the level of child benefit annually which is done immediately before the up-rating statement every year <e> <s> the noble lords amendment required us to do that again in april <e> <s> i regard that as tautological <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be the normal annual up-rating order and that as usual will be in the form of a debate <e> <s> on housing benefit tapers there is no change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that after minutes i should answer the detailed point of the noble lords last question <e> <s> however i shall try to explain the once-and-for-all amount of community charge <e> <s> the point of incorporating that in the statement is that it is a new charge and therefore there must be a new benefit <e> <s> following normal procedures when it occurs it will be rolled into income support and in future up-rated by whatever income support is up-rated <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot find the figure at this moment <e> <s> however the answer that the noble lord would expect is the true answer it is considerably more <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> however i do not know the up-to-date figures <e> <s> she was right to say that million was set aside for this year <e> <s> if one divides that amount by one sees that something of the order of two-thirds has been spent on a month by month basis <e> <s> if we were an uncaring government as the noble baroness would publicly expect we would as a result have chopped the million in our plans for <e> <s> we have done nothing of the kind <e> <s> it is a new scheme which will take time to bed down <e> <s> she will be delighted to know that million is in the budget for community care grants for next year as indeed it is for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords what it means is that from april next year those who are eligible for income support on the normal basis of income support will get it <e> <s> the present income support only arrangements will as a result disappear <e> <s> the structure will be in place for helping people not only with their board and lodging costs through housing benefit but also in regard to what i call disposable income after they have become eligible for income support <e> <s> that must be right <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i shall be coming to the voluntary organisations in a minute but they are most certainly to be included <e> <s> i was interested to hear that the noble baroness lady masham has acted as a partial handynet system herself <e> <s> we all try to do this in our own particular and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry spain <e> <s> alongside the handynet programme the commission intends to promote projects and award prizes for good practice in mobility and transport access to public buildings facilities and housing including support for people living in independent accommodation <e> <s> i agree with your lordships committee that in this country our objectives in taking helios forward should be to overcome the problems that arose in the first action programme and to set out a clear and agreed working mechanism for overseeing the whole programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i must finish what i was going to say before i am accused of being patronising <e> <s> i was pointing out that the noble lord was a distinguished doctor well before i took much interest in the affairs of disabled people <e> <s> i do not think that is patronising at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity we have been given today by the noble lord lord ponsonby to debate tourism and to set the review announced by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment on th july in context <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent years the noble lord lord graham and i have had countless arguments about the cost of economic developments falling upon ratepayers and i take his point <e> <s> i said that the intervention of both the british tourist authority and the english tourist board and the back-up section grants which have been so praised this evening are involved in spreading the load and increasing the visits to those traditionally unvisited areas in our country <e> <s> i am sure that that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords the sharon campbell case as far as i know was not one of the cases <e> <s> i stand to be corrected and will write to the noble lord if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> in which case on this occasion not only shall i not refer to it but i shall not write to the noble lord either <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a new scheme so it is inevitable that it will build up slowly <e> <s> however looking at the awards made between april when it started and november i can tell the noble lord that there has been an increase of in claims <e> <s> so it will build up slowly <e> <s> i cannot give a date at which any target level may be achieved however the scheme is building up quite well <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to put form fc into the library <e> <s> i accept straight-away that it is long and that it looks very complicated <e> <s> it is designed to be simple to complete <e> <s> there are full explanations about what is required and most claimants can skip whole sections which do not apply to them <e> <s> nevertheless i accept the implied criticism of the noble baroness <e>

further details of that case <e> <s> i know that there were some problems in the early weeks of the new scheme but average clearance times have now reduced to about working days <e> <s> i accept that that is still too high and that the target is days <e> <s> as staff become more experienced i am confident that we shall soon be hitting that target <e>", "<cs> my lords the new form that i mentioned is being widely consulted upon <e> <s> i should not like to give my noble friend the name of any particular organisation which we are consulting <e> <s> i assure him however that the form will be looked at by people outside the department before it is printed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first point that the noble lord lord banks has made namely that if people are eligible for family credit the freeze in child benefit will not be compensated in the case of those who do not claim <e> <s> that is why we have made it our policy to increase the rates of family credit very generously <e> <s> for example in a local job centre near my home an experienced hair stylist was advertised for at gross weekly pay of <e> <s> for a family with two children aged between and the payment would be in family credit if they applied today with an extra after the uprating in april <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think so <e> <s> if ones objective it to target money to poorer families it is of no benefit to increase child benefit <e> <s> we have uprated family credit by the rossi index of <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i do not agree that family credit is a stigma on the poor and a subsidy for employers paying low wages <e> <s> there are and always have been low paid jobs in the economy and it is right that the state should encourage employment in those areas by paying extra state benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords we are statutorily bound to examine the levels once a year in connection with the uprating statement as noble lords will be well aware <e> <s> next aprils uprating will target help to those most in need <e> <s> the majority of any child benefit uprating will go to better off families including the wealthiest <e> <s> among families who stand to gain from <e>", "<cs> my lords there is currently a better off in work campaign being conducted through the department of employment and a major exercise began at the end of last month which will run until christmas boosted by advertising on local radio and taking other local initiatives <e> <s> everyone who collects child benefit from the post office will receive a leaflet about family credit <e>", "<cs> my lords families can elect who receives the family credit and i am advised that in most cases it goes direct to the mother as does child benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords there is absolutely no evidence at all for that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the net annual saving from not uprating child benefit will be around million but we are making available an extra million to the neediest families over and above the million which the normal uprating of income related child benefit allowances will cost <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it was a recognition of need <e>", "<cs> my lords the children of this country especially the poorer children are benefiting to a considerable degree as i have made clear in previous answers <e> <s> as regards the social security budget that will increase by billion in the next financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always believed that the primary responsibility for training skilled operatives in the building industry rests with employers <e> <s> the government will continue to provide support for training through their youth and adult training programmes and by establishing the right framework at local industry and national levels to produce a more flexible adaptable and highly skilled workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the firm intention of ministers to have a meeting with the chairman of the board shortly after christmas <e> <s> the purpose of that meeting will be to invite the chairman to draw up plans including a timetable for moving his board away from its reliance on a statutory levy and becoming an independent non-statutory body <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of any government policy in this or any other area is to improve on the training situation in any particular industry <e> <s> i am confident that the discussions will result in an improvement in skill training in the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords without a dictionary in front of me i suggest it probably means one who operates <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble baroness is right <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason to be complacent about the number of accidents in the building industry <e> <s> the care taken within the youth training scheme to train in accident avoidance has been increased substantially in the past year or so <e> <s> i have no information on the other point raised by the noble baroness and will have to write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i am confused by that question <e> <s> at present the construction industry is booming and has been for some considerable time <e> <s> this question refers particularly to skill shortages in the building industry <e> <s> any arrangements for the future provision of training will have to take the noble lords point into account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly pass that point on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not immediately aware of the ec document to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> many of your lordships will have seen an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the government who are training the employees but the construction industry training board <e> <s> however i agree with those detractors of apprenticeships that the existence of only one form of training to one level of competence is most certainly outdated <e> <s> the time is overdue for a flexible modular system of training which will cover training to an advanced craft level and which will also allow employers and workforce to train and retrain to gain the skill levels appropriate to need <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> that is why we are currently spending billion a year on employment training as opposed to the miserable -odd million spent in <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i cannot <e> <s> however that is immaterial <e> <s> since figures are always given on a consistent coverage basis past figures have to be reworked when changes are made <e> <s> therefore i believe that absolute figures would be misleading <e> <s> it is important that on that consistent basis the trend is very firmly down <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord callaghan well knows we inherited a rising figure of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has asked for that figure i can tell him that it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that that is <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that that is misleading would be to use an unfortunate word <e> <s> however i believe that the noble lord has a faulty memory <e> <s> i am advised that although the figures were far lower in may than in july nonetheless the stoking-up in the economy generally caused those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure has continued to go down as i pointed out <e> <s> my original answer shows that falls before the election were not temporary as some people claimed <e> <s> the figure has been going down and i believe will continue to go down <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three steps which can be taken first young peoples training through the yts scheme secondly employment training for those rather older people who may have been unemployed considerably longer and thirdly through employers making sure that the training that is required both in service and out of service is provided <e>", "<cs> my lords like their predecessors the government do not make forecasts <e> <s> however there is no reason to suppose that sharp falls in unemployment will not continue given the strength of our economy <e> <s> however your lordships will note that the government actuarys recent report on which the national insurance fund is based estimated that unemployment will fall to million in <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the underlying suggestion of that supplementary question is that there is a north-south divide in this country <e>", "<cs> but my lords there are many prosperous areas in the north for example parts of cheshire cumbria and north yorkshire and indeed part of the computer belt in scotland <e> <s> equally there are areas of high unemployment in the south <e> <s> the norths share of unemployment has hardly changed since and over the past year unemployment rates have fallen most quickly in the west midlands the north-west and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords yes most certainly <e> <s> i was not aware of the precise figure for the north-east of england but i am aware of a garage selling bmw cars in my noble friends old constituency which over the past months has consistently run out of cars on a month by month basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the leader of the opposition is referring to the social security bill which was introduced in another place last week and we shall have a full opportunity to discuss that <e> <s> however i rely on the answer i gave to the noble lord lord hatch that as these figures are calculated on a consistent basis if there is any change in the underlying entitlement rules to unemployment benefit the effect is worked back over the period of the figures and therefore one is interested in the trend at any one time based on consistent figures <e>", "<cs> no my lords regretfully i cannot but clearly billion must be considerably more than million in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that i am in danger of answering the wrong question in replying to the noble viscount <e> <s> however it has been calculated that there are unfilled jobs in the economy at present <e> <s> i am sure that employers do not advertise those jobs if they do not feel that they are worthwhile jobs which they want filled <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have to say about that is that the figures do not compare with like <e> <s> if they were fully adjusted it would not matter whether they were adjusted from the earlier point forwards or from the current point backwards <e> <s> one must look at the steepness of the trend <e>", "<cs> my lords regional policy over all governments in recent years has been extremely variable to say the least <e> <s> clearly i do not enjoy having people out of work for whatever reason but my right honourable friends in the department of trade and industry sought carefully to find buyers for those yards but regrettably failed <e> <s> there was therefore no alternative but to close the yards <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot answer that question because although i have glanced through the <e>", "<cs> my lords all these matters are for discussion between the usual channels as the noble lord the leader of the opposition knows full well <e> <s> since members of the usual channels are on the front benches opposing each other i am sure that they will have heard the noble lords request <e>", "<cs> my lords the social security reforms that were introduced last april are admitted by claimants and local offices alike to be easier to understand and explain <e> <s> in the longer term the computerisation of social security operations will make an increasing impact from mid- onwards in improving service delivery standards <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards accuracy the improvements are already coming through <e> <s> as to operational strategy we are achieving this faster than intended <e> <s> the completion date has been brought forward by nine months to mid- <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> as in other jobs involving a face-to-face relationship with the claimant client or customer training for those implementing the social security reforms was conducted well in advance <e> <s> that training is continuous where it can be seen that it will <e>", "<cs> my lords how long it takes depends on the kind of claim <e> <s> the fact that the operation is so much simpler both in terms of rules and explanation of the new benefits will mean higher and speedier achievement times <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a valuable suggestion <e> <s> i have not so far made an unannounced visit <e> <s> however i have made various announced visits to social security offices up and down the country <e> <s> those will continue <e> <s> we are increasing our major new works in social security offices at a cost of over <e> <s> in we had one such work in we have <e> <s> there were in the intervening year <e> <s> we are also more than doubling the capital value of such works from million to million comparing this financial year with the next <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know that hereford and worcester county council had <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have received the comments of the social security advisory committee on this subject <e> <s> they are taking a little time to study and we shall respond to them in due course <e>", "<cs> no my lords i regret that i cannot <e> <s> discussions are continuing and the next meeting will be in mid-january <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that we have been slow in implementing the act <e> <s> six key sections are now in force <e> <s> but it is essential that before each section is implemented the resources required should be identified and made available <e> <s> any other approach would be irresponsible <e> <s> before any section of the disabled persons services consultation and representation act is implemented the cost must he identified discussed with the local authority associations and made available <e> <s> this inevitably takes time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords over the years local authorities have been very resistant to identifying particular pots of gold as the noble countess might call them and applying them to particular areas <e> <s> local authorities are elected bodies <e> <s> it is up to them to identify for themselves their local priorities and act upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords have listened with great interest and to an extent with great appreciation to the points made by noble lords on both sides of the house <e> <s> like my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i was not surprised by many of the points made by noble lords opposite <e> <s> on many occasions they have been made before and have been replied to before <e> <s> therefore do not intend to follow all the points made this morning <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has clearly not forgotten the record of the last labour government whose inflationary policies did so much damage to pensioners and others on fixed incomes <e>", "<cs> i beg to move the second motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of the concerns which the noble countess has mentioned <e> <s> that is why we are in consultation with the charities and are conducting our own monitoring of the situation <e> <s> the house will remember that we said that we would monitor all the social security reforms <e> <s> we are putting that particular monitoring on a fast track <e> <s> further my right honourable friend the secretary of state has agreed to meet my noble friend lady faithful and representatives of a number of voluntary organisations including barnardos and the national childrens home very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no advice as to the amount <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble baroness knows that the amount of income support for such young people would be plus full housing benefit <e> <s> the government have given a guarantee to all young people that a yts place will be available on demand and that guarantee is being met in all areas of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords in substance i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the government believe that most parents not only should but want to provide for their children within the family unit and our policy should not discourage that <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware that children with no homes to go to or who have been thrown out of the parental home present a particular challenge to the social security system <e> <s> that is why we are monitoring the position and why we are engaged in consultation <e> <s> we are seized of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we should make it clear <e> <s> i believe that we have made it clear <e> <s> overall i repeat my advice from the department of employment there are plenty of yts places available for all and year olds who are able and willing to take them up <e> <s> as regards young people in isolated areas and i should not regard the city of glasgow which i visited earlier this week as an isolated area i am surprised to hear that places do not exist in glasgow <e> <s> they should go to the employment centre in this case in glasgow where a place will be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are wandering some way from the original question <e> <s> however i can advise the house that social security offices in london have not reported an increase in applications for income support from homeless young people <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the situation <e> <s> i am also aware that my honourable friend the minister of state has announced a postponement of the arrangements which were canvassed in the consultation paper <e> <s> however i can say that the government will be making up their mind on this matter with all speed <e>", "<cs> no my lords of course it is not we do not have that intention in mind at all <e> <s> four broad principles were followed in the governments approach <e> <s> the first was that the code would be most helpful if it contained within the same set of covers the infomation needed about the relevant law and good practice <e> <s> i believe that both those conditions are clearly identified within the code <e> <s> the second was that the detailed recommendations on how the balloting process should be conducted ought to take account of existing guidance on good practice for the conduct of balloting <e> <s> the third was that once the proposal to take power to issue such a code was known particular ideas should be drawn upon that had been put to the government <e> <s> the fourth was that the codes recommendation should be based as far as possible on what was known about how unions had conducted industrial action ballots <e> <s> i believe that that condition is also fulfilled within the code <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second supplementary question put by the noble lord is yes he may certainly take it that the contents of the code will be no more prescriptive than the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i had thought that that point might be raised so i have made investigations <e> <s> the legal status of the code is that it is not prescriptive but it is admissible in evidence in the field of general employment law <e> <s> however as my noble friend has asked me to look further at the matter i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not believe that that is so <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that the same criticism was directed towards the various legislative steps taken by the government since <e> <s> we now have the lowest record for industrial stoppages for many years <e> <s> i do not believe that the previous legislation or the final code when it is issued will lead to damaging industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly when we have a late easter there is considerable bunching of bank holidays in mid-spring and that is one factor of which we are taking account in this review <e> <s> as to when an announcement will be made i cannot help the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware and i am equally aware that there is no consensus on this matter <e> <s> however there is no doubt that some peoples attitudes follow the s popular song which goes something like <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the date of easter the problem is not so severe this year but it will be severe in and <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the right reverend prelate refers to the easter act <e> <s> my understanding is that that can only be implemented with the agreement of all the churches <e> <s> some branches of the orthodox church remain opposed and therefore the prospects of that reform are somewhat remote <e>", "<cs> my lords in another part of my work in government am concerned with the birth rate but i do not think that the two subjects necessarily go together <e>", "<cs> my lords i very often have difficulty in walking and i do not think that your lordships will see me dancing just yet <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> because of the difficulty in fixing a date for easter to which i have already referred it will be necessary to change other bank holidays in that period rather than easter monday <e>", "<cs> my lords i know from previous experience of this house that the noble lord has much more experience of the easter act than i have <e> <s> i shall undertake to look at the matter again but i referred to my understanding of it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am well aware of that <e> <s> there is no reason why one should not dance round a maypole on a sunday or any other day of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> all suggestions are gratefully received <e> <s> many people do not want the bunching as has been underlined by the various comments made as a result of my noble friends question today <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that maypoles are objects of interest of a very temporary nature <e> <s> therefore one will not necessarily find them in the same place each year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> an important part of our approach to helping businesses has been to make it simpler for them to deal with regulations where they need to be retained <e> <s> we have reduced the number of starter trial surveys and more recently started the one stop shops where small businessmen who by definition wear a large number of hats can make contact with all the major departments with which they need to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords what is important to small businesses is a stable exchange rate <e> <s> often one can only achieve that by temporary hikes in interest rates <e> <s> inflation is the key <e> <s> this is one of the means by which inflation is controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords the registrations to which i referred come from customs and excise which administers vat applications and returns <e> <s> the governments priority is to ensure that inflation remains under control <e> <s> i agree that high interest rates can be unhelpful to businesses but far more damage would be incurred if inflation were to return to past high levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend whose supplementary question conveyed what i intended to say <e> <s> i perhaps addressed the point rather badly <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am well aware of the continued interest of noble lords in the subject of research and in government funding for it <e> <s> there are schemes encompassing research for which grants are available <e> <s> this depends of course on the specific item of research in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot give the noble baroness the figures under the <e>", "<cs> no my lords not as such <e> <s> it may help the noble lord if i tell him that under the enterprise allowance scheme of those who complete months of that scheme per cent <e> <s> are still trading months after start-up and per cent <e> <s> are still trading three years after start-up <e> <s> i understand that those results are broadly the same as for any other small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> that is why last year the government introduced improvements to the export guarantee scheme which is of great use to all exporting businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i thought my answer out fairly carefully <e> <s> i believe that a stable exchange rate is what is needed in the export field <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords will know far better than i there is a complicated interrelationship between the rate of inflation the exchange rate and the methods used to keep the one stable and the other down <e> <s> at the moment one of the methods used is high interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords regrettably i cannot give that assurance <e> <s> clearly the operation of a port is in the hands of the port authorities and the other firms which work in that port <e> <s> i do not think that i can add anything to that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that there has been a substantial reduction since i think when the dock labour scheme started <e> <s> however i am sure that it would also interest the house to know that despite the scheme ports where it is operating are generally profitable and manning levels as the noble lord pointed out have tightened though there is still scope for further progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i should be an intermediary in the way that has been suggested by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the <e>", "<cs> my lords only three weeks ago my right honourable friend the prime minister made it clear that she had nothing to add to earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is the most hypothetical question i have heard in recent weeks <e> <s> there is really nothing to consult about <e> <s> as i have made clear there are no present plans to change the scheme and the views of employers users and unions are as we all know very well known <e>", "<cs> my lords how wide is the ocean how deep is the sea <e> <s> i have no comment to make on the noble viscounts question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to confirm to the noble lord lord grimond that the th century proverb that fish and communities stink in three days is now somewhat out of date <e> <s> if industrial action makes it impossible to land fish there is clearly a risk that some of the catch will go to waste <e> <s> however there is modern cold storage aboard ships which helps to reduce wastage <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have taken a number of steps to assist the occupational and geographical mobility of labour <e> <s> these include the provision of training opportunities our reforms in the field of housing and personal pensions the wider circulation of job vacancies and help with travel to job interviews <e>", "<cs> my lords each job centre has access to a computer network through which it can circulate vacancies within its local area and region as well as inter-regionally <e> <s> that is known as vacs the vacancy circulation system <e> <s> in addition employers can obtain access to main channel televison coverage of regional job vacancies via the employment services jobfinder programme <e> <s> an agreement has recently been signed with oracle teletext ltd which will result in the development of a national jobfinder network <e>", "<cs> my lords last years local government and housing bill seeks to link public sector rents to the true value of the accommodation being provided <e> <s> there is no intention to encourage wholesale migration as a result of any subsequent rent rises <e> <s> indeed many noble lords will recognise that the south-east is rapidly filling up <e> <s> government policy is that rents should be affordable with if appropriate a satisfactory level of housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be well aware of the government training schemes which are in operation and which we are due to debate next week <e> <s> that is the main way in which we can put people into work outside the south-east <e> <s> the employment service gives considerable help to job seekers wherever they may be seeking work either at home or abroad as i pointed out earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends upon ones point of view <e> <s> the recruitment and relocation of employees is primarily a matter for the employers concerned <e> <s> any relocation expenses incurred would be their responsibility <e> <s> however various things have been happening recently <e> <s> for instance only last week it was announced that two insurance companies the general accident insurance group and cornhill insurance plc are to offer cheap mortgages to part-time staff as the competition for scarce labour resources intensifies among financial services companies <e> <s> the noble lord may realistically say that this has nothing to do with the government <e> <s> the relocation of employees who are not government employees does not have a great deal to do with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the overseas placing unit of the employment service is able to provide a wide range of advice about working abroad including job opportunities notified by other european community member states and the european commission itself <e> <s> these vacancies are also made available to job seekers by the vacs system which i mentioned earlier and its imminent replacement the national vacs system <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware that we are talking about individual people many of them currently not in work <e> <s> i have explained the governments training policies to help people to get into work <e> <s> as regards the shake-out of labour i may not have been listening to what i have been telling your lordships but i do not recall having used that phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the government are in the least parsimonious <e> <s> the government give many millions of pounds a year for these purposes to wales scotland and northern ireland as we all know <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed the government have a policy of encouraging regional rather than national wage settlements <e> <s> they see this as one of the ways ahead in what we all recognise is a very difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords no i was not aware of the background to what my noble friend mentioned <e> <s> of course she is perfectly right <e> <s> only recently in the department of social security we have announced that over the next approximately two years we shall be moving jobs out of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the figure in the recent white paper on public expenditure to which the noble lord the leader of the opposition has just referred <e> <s> i am aware that next years grant for the highlands and islands development board will be million <e> <s> i do not regard that as unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wallace is quite right <e> <s> in the past arrangements have been made with local authority housing departments for exactly this purpose <e> <s> the current government policy is that by no means all housing for any particular purpose or area should be provided by local authorities <e> <s> therefore the government or the department of social security which i know most about will be helping its employees with their job moves <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a long way from the question <e> <s> however i can say that it is not government policy to provide million bicycles <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever method of uprating is in force it has always under all governments taken six months between the announcement and its implementation <e> <s> that is because a centrally issued order book runs for weeks <e> <s> as the lead time for printing and dispatching the books to post offices is three to four weeks a minimum period of six months is needed between the setting of the new rate and the new rate coming into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is contrary to the conservative manifesto <e> <s> under the present system recipients will always catch up in the longer term <e> <s> on an annual basis of course they gain when inflation falls and they lose this is the point made by the noble baroness when inflation rises <e> <s> that is why a major factor in this governments policy of keeping control of inflation reflects this major priority <e> <s> the historic method of uprating ensures that changes in the rate of inflation are taken into account and benefits are thus fully protected against price increases <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to paraphrase what i believe to have been the noble lords question are the long-term sick and disabled being disadvantaged under the method that we have chosen <e> <s> the answer is no because we have increased their benefits over and above inflation <e> <s> of course there are occasionally sometimes more often very good reasons for favouring one group over and above another group <e> <s> that is one of the factors that must be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> we are talking about around million cases <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first supplementary question he put the matter much more succinctly than i did but clearly we both agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord finds it difficult to be non-partisan <e> <s> however the reason for his dilemma is that all million newspapers are identical million <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness well knows that the next uprating will be announced next autumn and will come into effect in april next year <e> <s> we must all hope and strive for a reduction in <e>", "<cs> my lords since the increase given to pensioners has exceeded by several per cent <e> <s> the total amount by which inflation has risen <e> <s> as regards the noble lords primary supplementary question of course the next uprating will take account of past inflation as it did last year and the year before <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it would be damaging to people on benefit <e> <s> history has proved that forecasting inflation even if one forecasts only half the amount of inflation is an unreliable method of uprating which was more often wrong than right <e> <s> even the government of the party opposite switched as my noble friend lord jenkin reminded us from the historic to the forecast method in <e> <s> they then promptly switched back again <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the labour force survey shows million women working or seeking work <e> <s> we know that this represents the highest participative rate of any ec country except denmark <e> <s> the united kingdom is unique in the ec in having lower unemployment among women than among men <e>", "<cs> my lords the implication of that question i believe is that part-time employment does not count as real work which i would dispute <e> <s> i hope that that is not the implication of the question <e> <s> there is no doubt that many women and some men actively seek such jobs so that they can combine paid work with family or other interests <e> <s> there is no evidence that people in part-time work would like full-time work <e> <s> in september per cent <e> <s> of the estimated number of women in self-employment were working part time <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble baroness that it is important to encourage more women on to the labour scene <e> <s> whether or not tax advantages can be given in this regard is not a matter for my right honourable friend but for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> tax relief is already available to employers for providing child-care facilities <e> <s> there is much interest and discussion at the moment among the major firms as regards vouchers for child-care facilities <e> <s> that is something of which i heartily approve <e>", "<cs> my lords the comprehensive white paper as my noble friend lord elibank called it and the world importance of the white paper implied by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway is the subject of the thoughtful question of the noble baroness lady turner of camden this evening <e> <s> it is about tackling the barriers which stand in the way of employment growth in the s <e> <s> as she said and other noble lords have referred to it the question has sprinted around the order paper in recent weeks <e> <s> i too am glad that we are at last debating this important matter <e>", "<cs> yes i was listening <e> <s> the noble baroness knows perfectly well that unemployment statistics have been adjusted to take account of the changes in the definition of employment so that underlying changes in employment and unemployment can be observed <e> <s> the noble baroness might also be interested to know about other estimates of unemployment <e> <s> for example the labour force survey also shows substantial falls in unemployment have been taking place <e> <s> the level of unemployment in as recorded by the survey estimates shows that it was lower than the claimant count <e> <s> i am sorry that i do not have more up-to-date figures than the labour force survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that at all <e> <s> the noble baroness reads more into my words than i actually said <e> <s> i said that it is a well-known government supporter <e> <s> i agree that there was a hint of irony in that comment because in the past a good many of its reports have been critical of the ideas of this government <e> <s> i recall that when i first came to the house there were certainly one or two comments from that quarter critical of the then labour government <e> <s> i do not think that i need be criticised for making that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is protesting a little in advance of my argument <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord dean of beswick would like to add to that before i respond <e>", "<cs> my lords the questions are coming slightly in advance of my arguments <e> <s> the point i was making to the noble lord lord graham is that one can get all the things for which he is asking in other ways in the modern economic and social climate in which we find ourselves today <e> <s> when i said that no one would create wages council machinery today to achieve desirable objectives they were desirable at the time and they are to a large extent desirable now i meant that we would not today be using that machinery <e> <s> i stick by that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they are <e> <s> however surely the point is that they are not only paid in wages council industries <e> <s> moreover the social security system with all the debates we have had in parliament both during its preparation and now in its realisation concerns low wage levels across the board <e> <s> i see that the noble lords again wish to intervene but i must get on with what i intended to say <e> <s> i am afraid that i must be hard hearted in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am responding to a question which was put to me tonight it would be purely hypothetical for me to respond to something on which discussions have not so far as i know even taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the preamble to the supplementary question of the noble lord <e> <s> although i understand that the overseas development administration makes grants to non-governmental organisations to carry out overseas projects it does not normally contribute to their administration costs <e> <s> we have already bent over backwards by providing accommodation to the global secretariat as i have said <e> <s> we have also provided money for a consultant in vienna <e> <s> if and when specific projects are established in the united kingdom we shall of course consider any requests for support <e> <s> meanwhile i have no hesitation in commending this international cause to any sources of charitable and other funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree substantially with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i thank him for his welcome of my earlier comments <e> <s> but i am afraid that this is very much a question for the global group itself rather than her majestys government <e> <s> however i shall endeavour to find the information my noble friend asks for and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for those comments <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i quite agree <e> <s> indeed one of the early questions to which i replied from this box took place during the international year of the disabled in <e> <s> i seem to remember the subject was access to public buildings up and down the country <e> <s> i also remember that my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone was i believe the president or vice president of the national committee for that year when my noble friend lord campbell of croy was chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords the term disabled driver is as i understand it a very technical one <e> <s> it is written into the social security legislation <e> <s> it also appears in some of the transport legislation <e> <s> i hope there is a common definition <e> <s> i shall certainly endeavour to discover that definition and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which i was regretfully unable to answer <e> <s> i said that i would write to my noble friend lord renton and of course i shall include my noble friend in that correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comity of the whole house in all the remarks i made a few seconds ago <e>", "<cs> yes my lords everyone that is taking the effects of the two budgets together <e> <s> secondly at a week net pay will increase by per cent <e> <s> whereas at the higher earnings limit of per week net pay would only increase by about per cent <e> <s> due to the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i explained in the closing moments of my rather too long speech for which i apologise that i was referring to two budgets not the one budget upon which the noble baroness based her figures <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the various things that have been going on in social security over the past year or two and because the debate was time limited i was within my rights to say that i was unable to add to the recent remarks made by noble friends <e> <s> so far as it concerns community care i am sure that the noble lord will read with interest the debate on the st february in the name of my noble friend lady cox <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend said on the griffiths report for example was that announcement would be made shortly <e> <s> he also pointed out that shortly was not as soon as when he used the expression some days previously in answer to a parliamentary question <e> <s> beyond that i do not believe that it is productive to go tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a very welcome move and as my noble friend said has fulfilled a longstanding manifesto commitment <e> <s> it will be for individual earning pensioners to consider whether they will be better off deferring their pension for up to five years <e> <s> currently pensioners earn over a week <e> <s> that includes wives who claim a pension on their husbands contributions <e> <s> indeed people will benefit immediately because their pension is currently reduced because of earnings of more than a week <e> <s> we also estimate that there are currently earning less than a week who may choose to earn more <e> <s> and of course there are all those future pensioners who may want to continue to earn <e>", "<cs> my lords as a horticulturalist i am very fond of plants <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right indeed he has long expereince in such matters <e> <s> that is why i prefaced my last answer by saying that it will be for individual earning pensioners to consider whether they will be better off deferring their pension for up to five years <e> <s> the department cannot tell them what to do but their financial advisers can <e> <s> deferment is most valuable for example if it is a full five-year deferment it enhances the value of the pension by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords pensions have always been taxable <e> <s> therefore the answer to the noble lords question on both counts is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i need a little notice for a question of such complexity <e> <s> however i can say that the noble lord is only half right <e> <s> a pension is a contributory benefit and if full contributions are not paid the pension is reduced <e> <s> but i agree with him in that todays contributors pay for todays pensions <e>", "<cs> no my lords the rules on deferment will stay exactly the same as they have been heretofore <e> <s> one is only allowed to defer a pension for five years <e>", "<cs> my lords it never ceases to amaze me how rarely good news is welcomed by those on the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> of course i cannot say how many pensioners have financial advisers <e> <s> however what i can say is that we plan to write to all the individuals concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that trend started rather before my right honourable friends budget last week <e> <s> however i take the point that this change is also good for the labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords if this trial is successful urgent consideration will be given to a future larger scale trial possibly encompassing the whole river <e> <s> it will depend on this years trial <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has taken an excellent opportunity but i am afraid that her premise is wrong <e> <s> this particular fly prefers fast-flowing rivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that it is not an endangered species <e> <s> it is a very nasty little piece of work indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to what is described as a biological insecticide which is in fact a spore ingested by the fly which then eats up its insides as it were <e>", "<cs> my lords it can produce large bites which can cause very nasty side effects <e> <s> they have been reported as nausea diarrhoea and arthritis-like symptoms <e>", "<cs> my lords that would have to be the subject of another trial <e> <s> i think that we should deal with this one first <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed i am aware of the recent report of the cpag on the subject <e> <s> but of course that is not specifically in the terms set out in the question namely regarding care in the community which is a grant function as it were of the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords our objective has always been to target help on those most in need <e> <s> the noble lord may laugh but that is not a new policy <e> <s> it applied in much the same way under the old single payments scheme <e> <s> however i accept that it is an unfortunate fact of life that whenever a line is drawn some will always fall on the wrong side of it <e>", "<cs> my lords what matters to claimants as well as the speed with which their claim is actioned is accuracy and clarity of explanation <e> <s> the new computerised departmental central index is already beginning to combat fraud because the computerisation makes it very much easier to check for example whether double applications have been made <e> <s> installed in the pilot social security offices the system has exposed a number of bogus claims for income support <e> <s> we are taking action to ensure that offices yet to receive the system can check suspicious cases with those that already have the system thus exposing fraudulent claims <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said what matters to claimants is the speed accuracy and clarity with which their claim is actioned <e> <s> where the issue of the length of queue arises certainly a faster throughput of customers in local offices will be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the statistics on poverty normally come from the family expenditure survey <e> <s> that is a direct application investigation it has nothing to do with the number of people claiming social security benefits <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we anticipate that there will be reduced administration costs benefiting the taxpayer to the tune of about million a year by <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> clearly some indeed a large part of the figure of million a year will be used as regards the reduction of staff <e> <s> we have given staff a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of the operational strategy that is this computerisation project <e> <s> staff have accepted that fact <e> <s> it is envisaged that by or thereabouts there will be something in the region of fewer staff in local offices <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather thought that canute was male but let it be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not call that a definition <e> <s> when one compares with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security in a recent speech used a different time base the figures show that the poorest one-fifth of families with children received in using prices the sum of a week <e> <s> in they received almost exactly the same amount a week <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend was making the point in his recent speech that being less well off and being in poverty are two completely different things <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has pointed out poverty is relative and depends on where one happens to be the social conditions average income and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend takes me down a very semantically complex route <e> <s> it is an even more semantic road than that which other noble lords have tried to make me take during <e>", "<cs> my lords it might surprise the noble baroness to know that my wife chooses not to have a television at home <e> <s> that does not make her poor <e> <s> however my right honourable friend was seeking to say that yes of course there are those who are less well off in society and they are recorded as the noble baroness knows well in quintiles and deciles <e> <s> we discover this from such investigations as the family expenditure survey about which i have spoken very recently <e> <s> these are factual investigations <e> <s> we are able to quantify therefore the habits and the expenditure and income profile of various sectors of society <e> <s> i see nothing wrong in that <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would certainly agree <e> <s> if as we are frequently asked we increase the capital levels for housing benefit income support family credit and so on that would immediately mean that more people came into the categories of potential beneficiaries for those benefits <e> <s> if that happens some people certainly not i or my right honourable friend would describe more people as being in poverty <e> <s> that must be rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense the right reverend prelate is quite correct <e> <s> an assessment has to be used every year in order to decide the level of the various benefits <e> <s> however the sixth report of the social security advisory committee in said that there is no universally accepted way of assessing the adequacy of benefits particularly supplementary benefit which is designed specifically to help those in greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understood the question <e> <s> did the noble lord ask why the government persist in keeping records of <e>", "<cs> my lords statistics must be meaningful at the time that they are used <e> <s> some types of surveys and statistic gathering efforts are indeed meaningful at the time that they are carried out <e> <s> however a few years later or earlier they would not have been <e> <s> that is why the government have started a new statistical gathering base <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right <e> <s> that is why it is impossible to have a definition for example of poverty of less well off people or of disadvantaged people where the goalposts are constantly moving <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be helpful to reply in terms of the unemployment statistics that the noble baroness knows very well <e> <s> each time the statistical method is changed and there are different rules for example for claiming unemployment benefit a calculation is made using the new method of statistics back dated <e> <s> one can therefore see a trend <e> <s> exactly the same thing is happening with social security statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not matter whether the reference is to half whole three-quarters or a quarter of the average <e> <s> the goalposts would still be moving <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> the government are well aware of this <e> <s> i hope that the noble countess will do everything to correct the impression that she has gathered from some of the people to whom she talks and who advise her <e> <s> the advantage of a loan from the social fund is that it is interest free <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments social security programme has an impact on the lives of millions of people in this country namely on the unemployed the elderly families and young people <e> <s> we are well aware that social security spending is the largest single item of government spending accounting for in of public spending and costing each and every household in the land a week <e> <s> it is crucial that spending on this scale is effective that was true not only in we have heard references to beveridge and and now in but in each and every year <e> <s> conditions change and in this modern world they change very rapidly indeed <e> <s> that is why in recent years we have had an annual social security bill <e> <s> i cannot see the trend of the past few years being any different <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will remember that while the contributions to the state scheme are not actuarially based in almost all occupational schemes they are so based <e> <s> therefore i think it would be quite fair <e> <s> my noble friend has bounced me slightly and i should like to take that point away and study it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one clause that covers both points of fairness and economic efficiency <e> <s> clause deals with the relationship between social security benefits and compensation payments made in respect of the same injury <e> <s> the underlying principle established by beveridge is that social security benefits should be available to meet immediate needs but if the person later receives compensation <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the case at all <e> <s> there are two completely different concepts <e> <s> one is to be available for work <e> <s> i checked up on the matter this morning <e> <s> i believe that this has been necessary since unemployment benefit was first introduced in i see that the noble baroness is shaking her head but in any event that is the information i received this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> the other concept is rather different <e> <s> you can be available for work in other words you can receive it on a plate if it is offered but you do not have actively to go and get that plate and help yourself <e> <s> those are the two concepts which need distinguishing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right i do not have her remarks down in quotes as saying that but part of the tenor of her speech was to explore other avenues <e> <s> it does not terribly matter whether those other avenues include the attendance allowance <e> <s> i was pointing out <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring not to the comments of the noble baroness but to other questions when i said they did not particularly matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the best way that i can help the noble earl is by pointing out that we have a responsibility to the general public both as taxpayers and as customers <e> <s> we need to ensure delivery of the best service possible in the most economical way <e> <s> it is not realistic to provide a service regardless of cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord peyton <e> <s> once one has achieved improved efficiency in the service there will be spin-offs for the beneficiaries of that service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness is only half right <e> <s> the words about which the noble earl complained were read in connection with a statement made in another place but not as the noble baroness said repeated in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement was about a proposal to split the social security structure into a number of agencies <e> <s> that is not i repeat this firmly a step towards privatisation <e> <s> options for privatisation and contracting out were explored fully before agencies were decided upon <e> <s> it was concluded that total privatisation or contracting out were impractical <e> <s> a good deal of the departments work especially in the computing area is already contracted out <e> <s> the department and its agencies will continue to test the market for opportunities for cost-effective administration through contracting out <e> <s> that will be investigated thoroughly in appropriate areas <e> <s> i must emphasise that that is not privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords this countrys social security system is based upon local office operation <e> <s> clearly the more management effort one puts in and the better training one has the more efficiently an office will run <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i tried hard not to give that impression because it is not what my right honourable friend intended to convey on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the ways in which we are seeking to provoke if that is the correct word efficiency is to establish targets such as those to which the noble countess referred in the various areas <e> <s> the objective is to give a concrete and practical expression of our intention to deliver a high standard of service in accordance with our definition and to improve standards of performance where necessary <e> <s> it may interest the house to know that i have arranged for those targets to be put in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the house will appreciate the reference to nazi concentration camps with regard to this subject <e> <s> however it is important to get the structure right because if one does not do that one cannot pay benefits efficiently and give a good service to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is becoming rather deep and devious for me <e> <s> i have advised the house of what my right honourable friend intended to convey and i do not think that i can usefully advise it any further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they are certainly substantial sums <e> <s> it may help the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords rather like housing benefit the money from the rebated community charge will be in the hands of the local authorities in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords a year is the most recent illustrative estimate of what the community charge would have been in had it been in operation <e> <s> that compares with an average rate bill of <e> <s> two community charges are roughly as the noble lord indicated equivalent to one rate bill <e> <s> but clearly the objective of the governments policy is to spread the financing of local government rather more widely across all adults <e> <s> therefore another two adults in a house will mean another two adult rates of community charge <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that must be per couple <e> <s> but if the noble lord would like to send me the evidence he has of these figures i shall certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords on the figures i have given they will be bearing an amount of p per week <e> <s> having said that i should point out that <e>", "<cs> my lords my figures are the expected averages across the whole country <e> <s> we expect all authorities to be submitting estimates of community charge levels for next year when the community charge will be coming in and therefore we shall be able to do a more precise calculation of benefit expenditure later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords if fewer people were to pay the community charge clearly the community charge bills would be even higher <e> <s> i think that the answer to the noble earls question is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> before responding to the two points which have been made in relation to the amendment i should like to welcome back to his place the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> it would be very strange to talk on this subject without his presence and i am delighted that he is here at least to listen to us after his illness <e>", "<cs> i was grateful to hear the noble baroness lady turner say that this is a probing amendment because i must confess that when i first saw it on the marshalled list i was rather shocked <e> <s> the clear intention behind it is that in march the government of the day should be bound to reconsider the decision embodied in clause to abolish the treasury supplement <e>", "<cs> that was a very clever parliamentary fast ball one which i hope i can hit back towards the noble baroness by saying that i made the governments views on her bill perfectly plain on second reading and at present i have nothing further to add <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that slamming stable doors is a furious sport but never mind <e> <s> this clause embodies in legislation the contributory principle that the cost of benefits to which contributions give entitlement should be met from those same contributions <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right <e> <s> the billion is the government actuarys advised figure of nine weeks of benefit of so to speak extra insurance <e> <s> this means that if there is a sudden rise in for example unemployment or a sudden rise in pensioners there is enough money in the fund to pay the expenses which flow therefrom <e> <s> there is way and above the nine weeks of benefit as my noble friend points out there is a surplus of around weeks of benefit and that is another reason why we no longer need the treasury supplement <e> <s> however as i pointed out earlier we are also reducing the income to the fund by the operation of clause <e> <s> we are increasing the expenditure or the expected expenditure because of the abolition of the pensioners earnings rule which was widely welcomed in all parts of the chamber <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may put the record straight <e> <s> on the occasion referred to i said that child benefit will continue to be paid as now i did not refer to social security benefits <e>", "<cs> in that case i must put the record doubly straight <e> <s> i did not intend to say that i was talking about child benefit at that moment <e>", "<cs> no one in this committee who has experience of people who are both blind and deaf or suffering from mental handicap can fail to be moved by the eloquent way in which noble lords have spoken <e> <s> i do not have any such experience but i can certainly say that i have been very clearly moved by what has been said as many members of the committee will have been <e> <s> i am also very much aware of the fact that there is considerable support on an all-party basis for the groups which the amendment is intended to assist <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> it was not the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> i know that he is such an enthusiast for the disabled persons act and i was surprised <e> <s> i understand it was the noble lord lord carter who made that point <e> <s> i am glad i have now got that right <e>", "<cs> no i do not believe i was arguing against myself <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that we shall be getting on because the giving of the money is totally in our own hands <e> <s> we shall be getting on with first the review and then secondly our implementation of it as quickly as we conceivably can <e> <s> that is very different from the situation as regards the disabled persons act where we made it very clear at the very beginning even at second reading in your lordships house if my memory serves me right that we could not implement it until we had agreed the resources between central government and local authorities <e> <s> there is a very distinct difference <e> <s> with respect i do not believe i am arguing against myself <e>", "<cs> if members of the committee would like to cast their minds back over the past years i shall be very surprised if they can remember a parliamentary year when there was not a social security bill <e> <s> i cannot of course pre-empt the queens speech <e> <s> i believe that noble lords will be perfectly reasonable in drawing the same lesson from the past as i have and applying it to the future <e>", "<cs> the answer to my noble friends last question is yes <e> <s> that is what it would mean <e> <s> my second point is that the amendment as i read it i am sure the noble lord lord carter will confirm this is intended to help people who do not qualify now <e> <s> some people do qualify so clearly there would not be double provision for those if we passed the amendment <e> <s> nonetheless there will be a cost but it is an unspecified cost <e> <s> i have not been able to ascertain from my advisers what the cost will be <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has been able to make an estimate of it <e>", "<cs> with all her knowledge i am rather surprised that the noble baroness is not aware that the first people to feel the effect of the existing cut-off at the age of will only do so as from next november <e> <s> therefore this bill is designed to ensure that the brown envelope about which she is so worried arriving on the th birthday will not in fact arrive and that attendance allowance will continue to be paid under the provisions of the bill until the person reaches the age of <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to members of the committee i meant to say mobility allowance <e> <s> the noble baroness made me so confused when she talked about the ages of and that i subsequently confused the committee <e> <s> nonetheless it is a fact that the first people to feel the effect of the existing cut-off at the age of will not do so until next november <e>", "<cs> with leave of the committee i should be most happy if the amendments were so grouped <e>", "<cs> clearly i must apologise to the committee because i rather jumped the gun in my eagerness to answer the point made by the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> however i must say to the noble earl that even more difficult issues of principle arise in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what is proposed not only removes the new interim cut-off at the age of for payment of the allowance as in the first amendment but it also removes the other upper age limit whereby the allowance must be claimed before the age of and only in respect of disability existing before the age of <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord mottistone that anyone with more than a drop of sympathy in their veins must be moved by the intention behind these amendments to give help to people who suffer disability in the course of a terminal illness <e> <s> members on all sides of the committee have spoken persuasively about the grim situation of those people whose illness progresses to the point where they satisfy the disablement criteria which govern the entitlement to attendance allowance but then die before they have completed the six-month qualifying period <e>", "<cs> i think it would be easier if i answered the final point first <e> <s> i am not sure whether my noble friend lady faithful was present when i said earlier that i had no doubt that the committee could draw lessons from the past years <e> <s> my noble friend will remember that in the past years to the best of my knowledge and belief no member of the committee contradicted this there has not been a year when a social security bill has not been introduced <e> <s> while i cannot of course pre-empt the queens speech i cannot see why we cannot draw the lessons of the past into the future <e> <s> i hope that that will help my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i have said what i have said <e> <s> i think the committee is in quite a strong position to accept my assurances <e> <s> if that is not the case i am sure that all members of the committee will leap down my throat like perhaps i had better not mention any dogs at the moment as they are a rather difficult subject on various fronts <e> <s> however i see the noble lord the leader of the opposition is in the committee <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i appreciate the feelings of all members of the committee and especially the point that the noble lord lord kilmarnock has just made <e> <s> however i explained earlier that there are very real difficulties in the attendance allowance approach <e> <s> i referred for example to the difficulties of doctors outside the hospice situation telling a patient that he was getting palliative care <e> <s> i know that is a euphemism for death within a very short period but i do not believe that the great british public is stupid <e> <s> i believe the real meaning of that phrase would get around very quickly <e> <s> i want to do something and quickly but i want to get it right <e> <s> that is the final message i wish to leave with the committee <e>", "<cs> the attendance allowance is not means tested <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is that short-term sickness benefits are available in the social security system <e> <s> attendance allowance is always intended to be a special allowance for those who have proved to be long-term sick and disabled <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord ennals with his great experience can confirm that <e> <s> the committee is asking me in this special case i have accepted that it is a very special case to remove that long-term criterion <e> <s> i am quite prepared to do that but as i have said over and over again i wish to get it absolutely right <e>", "<cs> i think that there has been a slight misunderstanding concerning the basis of the amendment <e> <s> i welcomed the assertion of the noble baroness lady turner that she would not rake over the cold coals of last years bill which is the act <e> <s> that did not last very long because she went on to refer to it not at some length but certainly in a significant portion of her speech as did the noble lord lord stallard <e>", "<cs> i was not saying quite that <e> <s> the noble lord made the point that these are very poor people and i was responding by saying that they are less poor than some of the poorer people to whom is rightfully given their contributory unemployment benefit <e> <s> i do not intend and i do not think that noble lords would expect me to go into the arguments that we adduced in connection with last years bill <e>", "<cs> do i recognise the declaration of a truce between the noble earl and my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i wish i could be as brief as was the noble baroness in moving the amendment but i am afraid i have a lot which i ought to say <e>", "<cs> as i said in the communications to which i have already referred i cannot countenance an exemption of voluntary workers from the need to seek work actively <e>", "<cs> we all agree with the need for training and the need to encourage training but i am not sure that it is right to achieve this desirable end through the mechanism of the social security bill and in the context of unemployment benefit <e> <s> having said that i will most certainly take up the request put by the noble baroness and have this matter studied much more fully than it has been <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those members of the committee who tabled these amendments because they will enable me to clear quite a lot of ground work <e> <s> they will also enable me to give a good explanation of how we see clause actually operating <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> if we felt that that was an appropriate thing to do we would not turn the matter over to the adjudication officer at all we would let the claimant adviser judge the issue <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that that would be wrong <e>", "<cs> they will continue to be given benefit until the adjudication officer has made up his mind in which case if he makes up his mind in favour of the claimant unemployment benefit will continue for the past period but if he makes an adverse decision unemployment benefit will stop but only for the period that i have described earlier <e> <s> i hope that that helps the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> it could be that the threat of loss of benefit results in the breadwinner getting a job <e> <s> if the counsellor thinks that it is doubtful whether the claimant is actively seeking work as i have explained he will refer the matter to the adjudication officer <e> <s> that already happens in other areas of unemployment benefit as the noble lord will know <e> <s> we know from experience that sometimes this is just the extra push needed for the unemployed person to obtain a job <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that i was not being devious <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness that that is far too long <e> <s> i am surprised that from two to three months is anything but an extreme length of time in particularly difficult circumstances <e> <s> there is no reason why the period should be two to three months in the case of seeking work <e> <s> i am advised that on average the period is weeks <e> <s> that is still not very good but it is slightly better <e>", "<cs> i am as horrified as the noble baroness and other members of the committee are to learn that <e> <s> i shall obviously have to cross-examine my advisers and find out what on earth is going on <e> <s> i regard this as a very serious matter indeed <e>", "<cs> in defence of the department which i am proud to represent in this chamber i would say that the department itself does not organise appeals tribunals <e> <s> appeals tribunals come under the auspices of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> that is still no excuse but it offers perhaps some excuse for officials who work so hard and so diligently in my own department <e>", "<cs> i still do not think that applies for the reason i tried to give to the committee earlier namely that it is the adjudication officer who makes the decision <e> <s> once the matter is taken out of the adjudication officers hands and goes on to further appeal through the social security system that is a different matter <e> <s> however the matter is not prejudged in the sense that i believe the noble baroness means <e> <s> i shall have to study this exchange very carefully and follow this up if i am wrong <e> <s> however i hope the noble baroness and i are not talking at total cross-purposes because neither of us would get any benefit if i may use that word from that <e>", "<cs> yes in the circumstances i had better write as a result of these exchanges <e>", "<cs> the only response i can make to that is that it will be a rather longer letter than i originally intended <e>", "<cs> i hope that i need not spend quite as long on this amendment as i have spent on other amendments since we had dinner <e>", "<cs> this amendment makes a pleasant change <e> <s> it is not about actively seeking work but about the existing provision availability for work <e> <s> as i said in one of my missives to noble lords replying to various points raised at second reading unemployment benefit legislation currently recognises in the form of regulation of the social security unemployment sickness and invalidity benefit regulations that it is in prescribed circumstances reasonable to give unemployed people a period of grace in order to arrange their affairs and still be regarded as available for work <e> <s> thus if someone is claiming unemployment benefit and at the same time providing a service by which is usually meant undertaking some voluntary work <e>", "<cs> voluntary work means work outside the home but this is exactly the kind of question that i welcome because i have made it perfectly clear that the regulations the barest bones of which i circulated are matters for discussion <e> <s> we have not yet written the regulations let alone reached the point of debating them <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for making that point <e> <s> i shall have to take this away to think about whether it would be an appropriate method <e>", "<cs> i have to come clean with the committee and confess to the noble baroness that i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall therefore have to take advantage of referring to this matter perhaps in a subsequent debate this evening in order to satisfy her <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will forgive me <e> <s> if it was a weeks delay unemployment benefit would continue i am advised <e> <s> i take it from that that if it was longer than a week unemployment benefit would not continue <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i must tell the noble earl that i do not believe that work-related expenses are suitable for payment from the social fund <e>", "<cs> i am sure that if the noble lord speaks to amendment no <e> <s> that would be quite in order <e>", "<cs> unemployment benefit is intended to provide a measure of compensation to people who experience short intermittent periods of unemployment between jobs <e> <s> those unemployed for longer periods are eligible to claim income support <e> <s> this is a more flexible benefit which has no duration limit <e>", "<cs> my attitude would be the same as it was in regard to the amendment tabled in the name of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> i should perhaps repeat what i said only a few minutes ago <e> <s> we are dealing here with someone who has already received days of unemployment benefit <e> <s> therefore it is a rather different situation to that which both noble lords envisaged when they asked their respective questions <e>", "<cs> i gather that the amendment has been moved and it has been called that it has been moved <e> <s> the committee is clearly becoming tired at this late hour <e>", "<cs> some members of the committee are because i thought that i had already dealt with that point in my previous reply <e> <s> all i can usefully do to help the committee is to repeat what i have already said <e> <s> the -week period can be extended in certain special circumstances <e> <s> we shall specify only those circumstances in the regulations for which clause provides power <e> <s> it will be helpful if i again explain that we intend that the regulations will enable the -week period to be extended by up to weeks to take account of weeks when the claimant was unable to work because of sickness or maternity or when he was undertaking employment training or caring for an invalid <e> <s> the -week or six-month period could thus in the individual case become months in circumstances where the claimant was for certain periods prevented from <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should not dream of denying in this house especially my right honourable friends words <e> <s> secondly i am extremely doubtful that new criminal penalties are appropriate <e> <s> the reform of legislation since has shown that changes in civil law liability can be highly effective in curbing irresponsible official industrial action <e> <s> i see no reason why the same should not apply to irresponsible unofficial industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not committed to bringing forward any particular proposals because the review is under way <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that there is public demand for proposals to be brought forward which will end the particuarly nasty form of industrial blackmail implicit in unofficial action <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view with which i do not entirely agree <e> <s> a consultation paper will be published and such points can be made within the context of consultation on that paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly a consideration that i should be happy to put to my right honourable friend <e> <s> however in commenting on the implicit point made by my noble friend londons commuters would vehemently disagree that the kind of irresponsible unofficial industrial action we have seen recently should be allowed to continue <e> <s> they have borne the brunt of recent unofficial industrial action on public transport services in the south-east <e> <s> londons travelling public are helpless victims not a party to the dispute and nor do they have any means of hastening its resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the whole house would agree with me when i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that that was a rather fast ball because in recent weeks strikes have been on a continuing basis <e> <s> i am not aware that other countries have had strikes on a continuing basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept that there are other ways of dealing with this particular problem for example in many of the community countries collective agreements are legally enforceable and arbitration of disputes is mandatory <e> <s> however that is not a way in which any of us have sought to take forward employment law in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> of course there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter possibly through the good auspices of the usual channels as a result of the publication of the consultation document <e> <s> however in the possible event of legislation parliament will be able to devote its usual care and attention to that legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lords question much as it interests me is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however i agree with him that as regards british rail positions are currently rather entrenched <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is the job of government but it is the job of acas on whom governments have relied for several years now <e> <s> i should point out that million working days were lost in the months to april compared with an average of million in the s <e> <s> i cannot believe that continuing changes to employment law have done nothing to bring about that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the only advice that i can give to the noble lord and therefore to the house is to await the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in just over per cent <e> <s> of pensioner tax units were in receipt of income from some source other than state benefits <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they share in the new-found wealth <e> <s> no it is not true to say of pensioners that they are getting poorer if they happen to be in the lowest quintile <e> <s> the average equalised net income of pensioners in the lowest fifth of the income distribution increased by per cent <e> <s> in real terms between and <e> <s> in addition the percentage of pensioners in that lowest quintile fell from per cent <e> <s> in to only per cent <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> from november the occasion of the last labour <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that this matter is of particular interest to the noble lord and in this connection i have many times quoted the famous phrase of the noble lord lord wilson concerning the pound in your pocket <e> <s> it is the number of pounds in your pocket and their purchasing power that matters not where they come from <e> <s> our policy of increasing the basic pension in line with prices and creating a stable economic environment where pensioners income from other sources can grow to keep their value resulted in a per cent <e> <s> real terms increase in pensioners average total net income between and <e> <s> this compares somewhat favourably with the per cent <e> <s> real terms increase achieved by the last labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of basic state pension yes but in terms of total income to pensioners almost certainly not <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister with special responsibility for war pensions a post of which i am extremely proud i know that there have been many representations on this matter in the past two years during which i have held this office <e> <s> i have no doubt that if the representation from the royal british legion has not yet been answered it will be very quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that can be argued because both the lowest and the highest quintiles have increased over the period i mentioned earlier <e> <s> of course the noble baroness is right in that different occupational pension schemes use different methods for up-rating their pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords i was defending the government against the proposition that they had failed to honour their manifesto pledges of maintaining the pension in real terms <e> <s> over the past years the basic state pension has risen in real terms by per cent <e> <s> not by per cent <e>", "<cs> this is an enormous block of amendments <e> <s> i only hope that i am capable of doing justice to them in the way that other members of the committee clearly have in addressing their bits and pieces <e> <s> i start by saying that the noble baroness lady turner of camden is quite right <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> to to and are all to do with disqualification for unemployment benefit under section of the social security act <e> <s> as the committee is aware the present legislation requires it to be shown that employment is suitable in the case of the individual claimant before a sanction can be considered in relation to a failure to follow up <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady faithfull spoke to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i undertake to look very much further at that amendment in conjunction with the other departments which she mentioned <e> <s> i regret that i have not yet been able to do so <e>", "<cs> as has been made clear from what the noble lord lord henderson just said this amendment seeks to introduce into legislation the concept that a person should not be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit if he turns <e>", "<cs> i should not really refer to the question which i had the privilege to answer yesterday <e> <s> however if it will help the noble baroness a quintile is a fifth <e>", "<cs> because a quintile for some unknown reason within social security statistics is more readily understood <e> <s> i am sorry that it was not readily understood by the noble baroness <e> <s> that is what i was informed and that is why i used the word <e> <s> however we digress somewhat dramatically from the question which the noble earl put to me <e>", "<cs> no but there are all kinds of other considerations besides children which go into the calculation of the applicable amount <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps i have found something in the new clause <e> <s> i should like to say straightaway that i understand the problem <e> <s> however i am concerned as to whether this is the right solution <e> <s> while i was listening to the noble baroness lady seear my flighty imagination took me into a small village church where i was listening to the lines of the marriage service <e> <s> consider the reasons why marriage is ordained is one of the lines in that service <e> <s> i beg the noble baroness to look at the reason why invalid care allowance was ordained it was an allowance which was perfectly properly invented and subsequently extended to enable people to be supported while they were caring for someone else who was drawing attendance allowance <e>", "<cs> i shall come to that point shortly in my own inimitable way <e>", "<cs> there is certainly a real dilemma for the minister <e> <s> perhaps i may dispose of the question of the long-term effects <e> <s> members of the committee on all sides of the chamber have mentioned with approval what my noble friend lord caithness is trying to do in the field of housing <e> <s> i know that noble lords opposite do not approve per cent <e> <s> of some of his actions <e> <s> nevertheless he is making great efforts to persuade local authorities to do all those things which all members of the committee including myself want to see done to get people out of bed and breakfast accommodation and ensure that others never have to move into such accommodation <e> <s> there is no question about that whatsoever <e>", "<cs> in answer to that point one cannot earn rent from an empty property <e>", "<cs> i did not say that anyone should be proud of the health of families living in bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> i was pointing out that across the country wherever people live eating habits have changed and i believe have changed for the better <e> <s> the adequacy or otherwise of <e>", "<cs> by my calculations for two meals a day is <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee that figure is per week <e> <s> perhaps we can all get a little less emotional and calm down for just a moment <e> <s> the calculation that i was trying to make comes to a week <e> <s> the figures mentioned by the noble lord lord stallard have just been confirmed to me as absolutely correct <e> <s> however it might be relevant to point out that my medical advice is that an authoritative source calculated the cost for a moderately active man as a week in which in todays terms comes out at around a week <e>", "<cs> the noble lady jumped in just as i was about to say that the figure is closely reflected in the average shopping basket which is about a week <e> <s> we all know that the average person has cooking facilities <e> <s> that is true but there will be occasions when it is not appropriate to have cooked meals all the time <e> <s> no one has suggested that an uncooked meal cannot be eaten in a bed and breakfast hostel <e>", "<cs> the social fund does not stop that <e> <s> i have just had it confirmed that so long as the landlord does not mind having a cooker in the place i cannot see any good reason why he should application to the social fund would be likely to succeed <e>", "<cs> yes one can obtain the cooker from social security as i have just said but it is the landlords dwelling <e> <s> it is possible that on the one hand the landlord might be perverse but much more likely it could be that the wiring in that particular establishment would not be up to the strain of having a cooker <e> <s> that is why i tried to say that it was not a complete but a partial solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> if i had the wit after this long debate to make a summary of the position that i have arrived at in my mind the words of my noble friend lady blatch would serve the purpose very well indeed <e> <s> i am grateful to her for those words <e> <s> we know that there are roughly such people but i should have to confirm that fact <e> <s> in considering the matter i think that we should all get our facts right and establish exactly what we are talking about and seeking to achieve and as i said earlier the cost of it <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that it was too difficult to do something about it <e> <s> i said that i was absolutely convinced in my own mind and <e>", "<cs> that may very well be so but i cannot do it off the top of my head <e>", "<cs> i will try to be a brief as i can but i should start by making a general point rather like my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i cannot at this moment furnish the committee with the actual cost of either one of these amendments though i hope to do so by the time i have sat down but clearly it would be substantial <e>", "<cs> no but knowing that you have a higher income than you warrant would certainly be an inducement <e> <s> it is not the sole reason and there may be all sorts of other reasons why a young person wants to leave home <e> <s> however we of course accept that for a few young people continuing to live at home is not an option <e> <s> this is a particular problem <e>", "<cs> i regret that i have not because i have no way of telling at this moment how many to year-olds there are who would be on income support <e>", "<cs> yes i believe that that is a very valuable suggestion <e> <s> i shall look into it and write to the noble lord when i have discovered whether it is possible to move in that area <e> <s> one clearly has to protect the young person and also do a balancing act in protecting the taxpayer <e> <s> however i shall certainly look into the point raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness does not think that it is strange for me to nod my head i happen to be agreeing with her <e>", "<cs> i am the first to acknowledge that a very good way of giving people self-expression and self-reliance is through work and training <e> <s> therefore i am most grateful to the noble lord lord henderson for bringing this matter to the attention of the committee <e> <s> however what no one has <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that her majestys government appreciate and are sensible of the great debt owed to those injured or killed in the service of their country and to their dependants <e> <s> i should add to that very distinguished group those killed or injured as a result of service in any of the forces who are also eligible for war disablement pension whether or not they fought in a conflict <e> <s> we do not indeed make special provision for their particular needs <e> <s> like all war pensioners war widows receive compensation over and above civilian benefits to show our appreciation of the fact that they have suffered and borne the suffering of their husbands who fought for the welfare of the whole nation <e> <s> it is right and proper that we should do so <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will forgive me perhaps i may interrupt her for a moment <e> <s> the point about a discretionary system such as we have at the moment is that some local authorities will disregard nothing except the statutory others will use partial disregard and yet others total disregard <e> <s> i gave an example of a typical partial disregard <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> these amendments concern the arrangements which have been made transitionally to protect certain groups of claimants living in board and lodging accommodation who would otherwise have received less benefit overall as a result of the changes introduced in april as the noble lord explained <e>", "<cs> i find these debates absolutely amazing <e> <s> we have a long string of complaints before i have even opened my mouth and words are put into my mouth which i do not have the least intention of saying to the committee <e> <s> having said that before turning to the details of the amendment i think that it would assist the committee if i put the matter into the context of the principles which clause embodies <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says that that is not right but i should be very happy to discuss the point with him <e>", "<cs> she says that she will threateningly <e>", "<cs> the noble earl talks about unfairness but the situation that he describes can happen now with the existing per cent <e> <s> offset <e> <s> the trouble is that it is doubly unfair as it were because the per cent <e> <s> offset does not even help pay for social security benefits or anything like that <e> <s> it goes straight into the coffers of the insurance company and that cannot be fair <e>", "<cs> i should like to say at once that my noble friend has identified the policy intention and we both agree on that <e> <s> however moving and slightly changing the words to which my noble friend has drawn attention concerning the definition clause would not help as a solution because relevant benefits are left to be prescribed by regulation <e> <s> my right honourable friend mr scott set out in another place on nd march which benefits will be prescribed as relevant benefits and i shall be happy to repeat those if the committee so desires <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate my noble friend on spotting a genuine error in the bill and in those circumstances i am delighted to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said this matter has been running for a very long time or at least in terms of ministerial careers in this chamber it has been running for a very long time <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that most regretfully i am unable to do so <e> <s> i say that because i think that the noble lord is under a misapprehension when he suggests that the advice which i gave him and the advice upon which i prepared the comments i made this evening came from within my department <e> <s> the matter of the ombudsman comes from the office of the minister for the civil service and as i understand it there are constant discussions between my right honourable friends officials and the officials of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> therefore unilaterally so to speak i am not in a position to accede to the noble lords wish or that of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> there is nothing like cutting gordian knives with a knot or rather gordian knots with a knife if i may say so to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> having said that i wish to express considerable sympathy with my noble friends amendment which continues to legalise bridging pensions <e> <s> that sympathy extends to the situation that the schemes which that amendment is trying to alleviate will find themselves in from <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that clarification <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the point i made was that the proposals in the current bill do not come into effect until <e> <s> if we were allowed to change things there would be time to change them in a social security bill <e> <s> it is relevant for the committee to ask why we have made provision in this bill and not waited until a future bill <e> <s> we are advised that the pension industry wants to get started and wants the longest notice possible <e> <s> therefore once we had taken legal advice and heard from the committee of which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale is the distinguished chairman we decided to get on with it <e>", "<cs> yes that is what i am saying <e> <s> however it has now been widely agreed that the likelihood of being able to correct this matter in brussels is small and therefore the government propose to have the matter settled for the moment in this bill so that the occupational pensions industry can get on with reforming its schemes <e>", "<cs> i think that i mentioned way back in the early reaches of the afternoon in relation to amendment no <e> <s> that when we introduced the provisions for and year-olds we ensured that the most vulnerable young people retained entitlement <e> <s> i am sure that this is what the whole committee would have expected us to do and that is what we did <e> <s> this includes those who are pregnant and within weeks of the expected week of confinement or who at a time before this date are incapable of work by reason of an illness or medical condition arising from the pregnancy <e> <s> these are the same rules as apply to all pregnant women irrespective of age <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to extend entitlement to all young women aged or who are pregnant whatever the stage of the pregnancy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> however there is a problem <e> <s> in common with other single pregnant women such people unfortunately would not also benefit from amendment no <e> <s> because quite simply a single person is not a family <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware the family premium is already paid to all families with children <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as concerns the charities they fall into the first case which i mentioned and from october as i said the special income support rate for host el dwellers will cease <e> <s> they will be brought on to exactly the same financial footing as those currently on board and lodging <e> <s> as a result they will become eligible for normal income support for day-to-day expenses plus housing benefits to help them with the accommodation costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is necessarily a homelessness problem <e> <s> if it were the answer would be as i have said on many occasions for local authorities to be careful where they place their homeless people <e>", "<cs> my lords leaflets are being prepared to advise claimants and hostel managers and other advisory bodies of the change <e> <s> the local offices of the department of social security will issue a brief explanatory leaflet to claimants on an individual basis <e> <s> it will be sent with an explanatory letter plus the hostel claim forms <e> <s> in particular claimants will be advised to claim housing benefit as quickly as possible and not wait until th october when the changes come in <e> <s> the leaflets to advisers will be of a more technical nature and will explain the operation of the central unit in the department of social security which will make up shortfalls in hostel funds due to the change <e>", "<cs> my lords i can go so far as to agree with the noble lord that some local authorities are very bad housing managers indeed <e> <s> surprisingly one of the best housing departments in london is i hope the noble lord lord stallard is listening in the london borough of camden <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recent figure i have is people <e> <s> this is a figure i used in debate a fortnight ago <e> <s> i understand that this is a reduction from the homeless people of some two years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume from the remarks i have heard that i have the leave of the house to reply very briefly to this debate <e> <s> my noble friend lord wolfson with his unerring skill has put his finger right on the facts <e> <s> we all support the amendment <e> <s> there is no doubt about it whatever <e> <s> every noble lord supports the amendment <e> <s> but we need to know the facts <e> <s> those facts will not be available by third reading <e> <s> they will not be available first until the last opcs report is published and secondly until the data tapes to which i referred earlier have been properly studied not only by the government i get a distinct impression from all around the chamber that noble lords do not trust the government in this matter but have been independently checked <e> <s> that must be right <e> <s> that is why we cannot do it by third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it quite clear to my noble friend and to the rest of the house that we shall act in this matter <e> <s> we shall act in the first social security bill after this matter has been concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords most regretfully when we reach a later part of this bill schedule your lordships will find that this legislation must receive royal assent by th july of this year <e> <s> otherwise we shall be in breach of our ec obligations <e> <s> i am afraid that the noble lords suggestion although a wise one is not on this occasion an option <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> therefore we will resume consideration on report later <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord stallard seek to extend mobility allowance to enable people to claim it at any time up to age which he has just explained <e> <s> the age limit of for the payment of the allowance which we propose in clause would still apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the amendment in the name of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will not qualify because as we discussed on the last amendment she was not eligible before she was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the explanation of the noble baroness lady jeger about why we have been asked to consider the amendment today and for the great sympathy which she showed in moving it <e> <s> i hope that from what i said in committee noble lords understand that i share that sympathy <e> <s> nevertheless i must admit that i remain uneasy both about the purpose and the timing of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is all very well but the bill does not do anything of the sort as i hope to go on to explain <e> <s> i should point out that although the noble earl lord russell has tried to redraft this amendment i am afraid that in terms of drafting it inevitably suffers from much the same deficiencies as did its predecessor but i should not dream of dwelling on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by making a personal apology to the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> i know that he was very keen to discuss this matter with me before today but unfortunately our paths did not cross after he made the request <e> <s> i would have told him that we have already come a long way along the road that he would have us take <e> <s> this is to be found in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to overturn arrangements that have been in force for just over three months by modifying the way in which benefits are paid to people living in board and lodging accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already referred to the transitional arrangement which was in place for three months <e> <s> i maintain my view that local authorities had plenty of time to get people out of bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> they had accommodation of their own or accommodation which could be rented to achieve this <e> <s> there is no excuse for local authorities placing people in bed and breakfast accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the first to admit that lone parents like other parents who wish to work need to balance their work and family responsibilities <e> <s> the government believe that child care is something on which the parents should decide and arrange <e> <s> however there are also others who have a very important part to play <e> <s> employers are showing increasing interest in child care as a way of helping them to recruit and retain staff as labour markets become increasingly tight <e> <s> many voluntary bodies are very active in child care and the government provide financial support for a number of them <e> <s> the government see their role as to facilitate the development of child care facilities by employers voluntary bodies and others and to ensure proper standards <e>", "<cs> my lords that again was a most illustrative comment from my noble friend that i shall come to <e> <s> as the noble lord lord henderson said this amendment was discussed at some length during committee stage and i am not sure how much i can add to the explanation that i gave then <e> <s> i do recognise the strength of feeling which exists that something extra should be done to help people who have recurrent mental health problems to get into employment <e> <s> but i cannot accept that because some of these people qualify for the higher disregard while others the standard disregard this is sufficient justification for raising the earnings disregard for all of them to a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am going to be inconsistent again <e> <s> i hope that on this occasion the house can live with my inconsistency <e> <s> my noble friend is seeking an extension of the present statutory disregard in housing benefit of any war disablement or war widows pension <e> <s> she has proposed an increase to which doubles the present disregard while retaining the discretion which local authorities have to increase the disregard or indeed to disregard war pensions in full <e> <s> the amendment and hence the increase <e> <s> applies to housing benefit and housing benefit only <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the amount of money is not set out in the act <e> <s> it is a general power in the act <e> <s> the amount of money is set out in regulations made under the act <e> <s> that is what we need to change in order to accede to my noble friends wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl lord russell and the noble lord lord carter were living in a world where there was no other disability benefit i could immediately see the logic for this amendment <e> <s> of course there is an opcs factor in the matter as the noble lord lord carter knows full well <e> <s> however i think i should make the point that in the study of the opcs data the considerations will obviously cover proposals of the kind introduced by this amendment <e> <s> but i must stress that it would import into the income support scheme some of the worst features of the old supplementary benefit system which so bedevilled it and which led to the urgent need for its reform <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly after that debate the one trap into which i must not fall is to stray into a debate on clause stand part <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell has asked that clause be adapted in two important respects <e> <s> in my estimation my noble friend lord coleraine is absolutely right about that because my noble friend lord campbell like other noble lords who came to my meeting which has been so generously praised round the house characterised our proposals as unfair to the victim <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a copy of the report with me <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly that is so because my noble friend has just quoted from it <e> <s> however paragraph as my noble friend might be kind enough to confirm recommended that contributory negligence should be ignored but there is no specific mention of like for like <e>", "<cs> my lords without repeating in detail what i said in committee the basic principle behind clause is simple <e> <s> the point has already been made by my noble friend lord trafford <e> <s> it is that no one should receive more money in compensation for an accident from two sources added together than they would from one <e> <s> this principle has a respectable history starting with beveridge and more recently backed up as we have heard by the pearson commission the national audit office and the public accounts committee of another place and most importantly by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords of course they will <e> <s> i am glad that the noble baroness agrees but both the cbi and my noble friend have forgotten the maxim of this house something else that was referred to by one of my noble friends behind me namely that we all believe in the polluter pays principle <e> <s> in this connection it means that someone responsible for an accident will pay for the effects of that accident in full <e> <s> this maxim is however complicated by the fact that by law motorists and employers have to insure themselves against accidents <e> <s> the effect of this is that the premium payer has to meet the costs of the compensation rather than the individual who causes the accident <e> <s> the clause does nothing to change that <e> <s> it happens at the moment and it will continue in the future whether or not your lordships approve the clause <e> <s> thus insurance premiums will rise <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will do me the courtesy of waiting until i have finished the point he may be able to attack in an even stronger fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord because the point is that you are not being compensated out of private insurance which you yourself have paid for <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases you are being compensated out of the compulsory insurance scheme which your employer has taken out to pay for any injury which occurs on his property or because of the job for which he employs you <e> <s> therefore the situation is quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords in another place on th april the opposition spokesman offered what he called a grudging word of congratulation because the government have tackled an extremely difficult problem <e> <s> we do not find it acceptable that state benefits should subsidise the liability of those responsible for causing injuries simply because the benefit system has already had to pay as a result of those injuries <e> <s> the present situation is ripe for reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that my noble friend was replying to this amendment as he moved it which rather absolves me from returning to the charge <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is different because one pays it voluntarily <e> <s> that is the quick answer to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i should now hand back to my noble friend lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords during our previous debate on this issue i agreed to my noble friends request for a meeting and was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth and his advisers to look again at the question of bridging pensions <e> <s> unfortunately my noble friend lord mottistone was unable to be present as he has explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be brief because i do not wish to repeat what has been said previously in committee or indeed in a certain amount of correspondence between myself and the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> it is perfectly true that having taken advice i changed my mind in the early stages but since i changed my mind i have not wavered <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord henderson would accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord lord henderson has caught me rather on the hop <e> <s> nevertheless i must answer him by leave of the house <e> <s> as i understand it it is a decision of parliament as expressed in the parliamentary commissioner act <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can help the house very much especially in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the amendment is drafted the only people who would get the family premium under this amendment who do not already qualify for it would be couples expecting their first child <e> <s> i am not at present persuaded that pregnancy of itself gives rise to special needs over and above those already catered for by the issue of free milk and vitamins and the social fund maternity payment which would justify a special premium <e> <s> but even if i were i could not see any justification in giving such a premium for a minority of pregnant women only <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence shows that employers will respond to the voluntary arrangements and many non-statutory training organisations already have the active support of employers <e> <s> in addition there are already many non-statutory training organisations outside what was the statutory board system which are supported voluntarily by industry and are able to provide relevant training services to industrys requirements <e>", "<cs> because my lords the department has also published the results of a survey which was carried out last year which show that the majority of non-statutory training boards were indeed effective <e> <s> a national council for industry training organisations has been formed to help pull the nsto network closer together and to assist dialogue between the government and the non-statutory training organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords we all know that employment is a changing picture <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the first supplementary question no i was not aware that the noble lord had received that particular missive which i have not seen <e> <s> there are currently union representatives on the board <e> <s> as i said we are in consultation with the chairmen of boards and i should find it inconceivable that the chairmen were not in consultation with their own board members <e>", "<cs> my lords without getting into the donovan report despite the conspicuous success of this government in reducing unemployment the number went down again last month it is still at historically high levels <e> <s> with historically high levels of unemployment if the industrial training boards had in fact been working properly we should not be seeing as many skill shortages as currently exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has somewhat confused me i thought that i had answered that question <e> <s> i said that we are aware that the construction industry has continued to support a collective funding system <e> <s> whether it will be identical to the present one or a future one that will eventually evolve we do not know of course until we have heard from the chairman <e> <s> i am well aware of the points that the noble baroness has made <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot give that commitment on behalf of the government <e> <s> all the boards will be affected by government decisions to some extent or another <e> <s> i have said that the construction industry has continued and for all i know will continue to support a collective funding system <e> <s> that collective funding system is spread across the whole of the industry <e> <s> so long as it supports it clearly that would be a sensible way forward for financing that particular board <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do know that but i do not think that this is the moment when we <e>", "<cs> absolutely not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is asking us not for the continuation of the current statutory boards in some form or another but for new boards in other parts of the industry <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head <e> <s> i cannot answer off the top of my head <e> <s> i shall have to consider this matter and if he will allow me write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords not so far as i am aware <e> <s> as i said in my original answer some minutes ago we are consulting with the chairman of each industrial training board <e> <s> it would be next to impossible for any decisions to have been made in advance of our consideration of that consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord mccarthy with his inevitable skill at speaking had allowed me to go to sleep i would have woken up and thought quite naturally that we were talking either about the fair employment northern ireland bill or the dock work bill <e> <s> therefore i shall not talk about either of those bills <e> <s> however i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken today on the employment bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is not that <e> <s> just look at social security upon which this house has spent many hours during the past few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two roles in your lordships house <e> <s> one is as a spokesman on social security and the other is as a spokesman on employment <e> <s> however i take the point that this is an employment bill something which the noble lord opposite has obviously just remembered and i shall now try to reply to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something we should debate within the context of the social security bill <e> <s> that reminds me to answer a point made by the noble lord lord rochester who took exactly the reverse point from something i said the other day on the social security bill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that is by choice not by law <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the present arrangement is that training reports are placed in the library of both houses of parliament <e> <s> although i cannot confirm definitely that that will continue i shall be very surprised if it does not <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall let the house know at an appropriate moment during the course of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the circumstances in northern ireland are completely different <e> <s> this is an employment bill for great britain and the answer is i wont <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i shall have to have another go <e> <s> regulation c of the unemployment sickness and invalidity benefit regulations serves to help people claiming unemployment benefit to declare that they are available for work <e> <s> it might help the noble earl to reconcile my two apparently to him contradictory statements at a previous stage if i say that unemployment benefit is not the benefit for people who have substantial commitments in caring for someone or in providing any other kind of service <e> <s> it is for people who while unemployed are filling in their time usefully but whose prime aim is to get back to work as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady seear gave your lordships the opportunity of returning to the substance of this amendment <e> <s> i therefore in my response intend to address the points that noble lords have all made but also to address the two amendments which are tabled on the marshalled list <e> <s> i wish to start by stating the position under the law as it stands at the moment which is that while most and year-olds are not entitled to income support we ensured that the two most vulnerable groups are <e> <s> the first group comprises those who are for instance lone parents or young people who because of disability cannot work or take advantage of the guarantee of the offer of a yts place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely confident that there is absolutely nothing in the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and perhaps this ought to be for the last time the other matter which concerns young people and income support relates to actively seeking work and indeed availability for work <e> <s> again the position has been made quite clear during the course of the bill both in this house and in another place <e> <s> nothing in the regulations will detract one iota from what has been promised either by this front bench or the front bench in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> adjudication officers <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not believe in repeating the arguments that have been made at previous stages nor indeed in advancing those that may still have to be deployed i can confidently say that we have had an excellent series of debates over the past couple of months on practically every area of the social security system <e> <s> the short debate which we have just had on the motion that the bill do now pass is no exception <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all the noble lords who have spoken on this very important order <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich referred to its thickness and contents and i hope that the noble lord lord prys-davies will excuse me for having summarised only what i regarded as the main points <e> <s> not surprisingly i have been asked several questions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is fair comment but it could be that the proof of the pudding may at some stage be in the eating <e>", "<cs> my lords i was listening to the noble lord when he spoke and took the point that it was men probably rather more than cash in which he was interested <e> <s> i shall certainly follow up that point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may just say that i thought that i had answered the noble lords point i n my response to noble lords questions on the order <e> <s> i reiterate that it is not a saliva sample it is a gum lining sample which provides the dna <e> <s> that must be compared with another sample taken from the scene of the crime to either prove or disprove the connection <e> <s> that is the whole objective <e> <s> i hope that i have now been able to convince and answer the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord prys-davies that this is a genuinely beneficial and helpful order <e> <s> article almost exactly duplicates section of the licensing act northern ireland the only difference being the reference to cover pubs which of course can since the licensing northern ireland order provide accommodation <e> <s> therefore it has quite a long precedent <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether the way one deals with a telephone call and so on has ever been tested in the courts <e> <s> i do not know but i anticipate this is purely an off-the-cuff statement that the proof of the pudding so to speak would be in the signing of the residents book when one gets the key of ones room <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to note that the noble lord said from the very start which in this case was march <e> <s> the substance of the draft order has already been the subject of extensive public consultation beginning with the publication of a consultation paper on that date <e> <s> that was followed in october by the announcement of preliminary decisions in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition is right on almost all counts <e> <s> the government have no doubt that the ideal way to legislate for transferred matters in northern ireland is by discussions in a devolved government <e> <s> indeed that is what we have all been working for over the past years with varying levels of success as the house will know <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather surprised to hear the claim from the leader of the opposition and i must therefore confess that i rather ignored it <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge and belief orders in council are always subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> if that is the case i think that my noble friend has a point <e>", "<cs> my lords consultations often happen in parallel with legislation which is to come before this house <e> <s> there is then the extended proper consultation period where parties are of course informed by debates in parliament which are widely publicised in northern ireland <e> <s> as i say there are various legislative steps to be taken before a draft order in council is laid <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i had better move into that argument <e> <s> however as i say to the best of my knowledge and belief these orders in council are dealt with by affirmative resolution <e> <s> therefore it is up to any noble lord to contribute to the debate which must indeed be held <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the convention of this house is exactly that <e> <s> as we all know no affirmative or indeed negative order can be amended <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lords claim can be substantiated <e> <s> i say that because for example the opting out of grant maintained schools was dropped except in relation to integrated schools which are peculiar to northern ireland and integrating the education package was not proposed originally but was introduced in the current proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords no they cannot be amended <e> <s> as the noble lord will be well aware the bill procedure is used for matters which are unique to northern ireland such as fair employment <e> <s> the education reform proposals differ slightly in the ways that i have just described from those in the education reform act which was fully debated by parliament <e> <s> issues which are unique to northern ireland such as integrated schooling form a small part only of the overall legislation and would not warrant the exceptional use of the bill procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am sure that my noble and learned friend will rem ember the end of one bitterly fought session when our noble friend lord cockfield withdrew a treasury order which was an affirmative instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords in theory of course the thinking behind the suggestion by the noble lord lord blease is right <e> <s> however currently there is not much likelihood of elected representatives sitting down together to form such a desirable committee <e> <s> as i said earlier the government are open to all suggestions and i shall take up and pursue that suggestion with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather thought that the whole of this lengthy exchange on the question asked by the noble lord lord hylton was about inconsistencies and the impossibility of making comparisons <e> <s> the noble lord has therefore just achieved the impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall just respond to that specific point made by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> we have no plans at present to allow an order allowing certifying in <e> <s> i have no doubt that my noble friend lord colville will be considering scheduled offences diplock courts and so on in his enhanced review of the emergency provisions act <e> <s> we are still giving active serious consideration to certifying in as my right honourable friend the previous secretary of state said in the emergency provisions act renewal debate back in march of this year <e> <s> however there is no decision yet as to the result of that active serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble lord but did he say lecherous <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords list of questions took me a little by surprise in their detail <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to be called to account for any order i put before the house <e> <s> however the noble lord will remember that i said only the other day that the government as a whole would welcome advice on a better system than the order in council route of legislating for northern ireland <e> <s> i do not believe there is any dispute between us on that <e> <s> as much as the noble lord dislikes it i have yet to see any concrete proposals from him on what route we could take <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point <e> <s> the noble lord represents a widely held view from which i do not totally dissociate myself as i have made clear on several occasions <e> <s> however the fact remains that in this uncertain world in northern ireland legislation has to be arrived at by one route or another <e> <s> to have no legislation at all i do not think that even in his most pessimistic mood the noble lord would suggest that would cause a political vacuum which is what we are all trying to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come back to that point in a moment <e> <s> as i understand the position departmental approval is required only to guard against the appointment of an unqualified or unfit person <e> <s> that refers particularly to the chief executive <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to have such persons in the two positions which i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to all noble lords who have contributed to this short debate <e> <s> i was taken by surprise as much as other noble lords by the fact that we had a little interregnum in the middle of the debate <e> <s> on behalf of the front bench on this side of the house i apologise for it and i assure the house that i had absolutely no bearing on the matter <e>", "<cs> the financial year my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords who have spoken for their <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends clarification on this matter <e> <s> be that as it may i have noted that it has not stopped him from skiing <e>", "<cs> i understood from the noble lords remarks that it was staff at schools which changed their status and therefore that for one reason or another they may not fit into the new regime <e> <s> it was that point that i was intending to answer <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the legislation recognises that staff employed by education and library boards or the council for catholic maintained schools who are unwilling to transfer may indeed be redeployed <e> <s> the legislation does not rule out entitlement to compensation in other cases although like i am sure the noble lord i would hope that this is kept to the absolute minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no intention by the government not to listen very carefully to any advice tendered either by nie the consultants the noble lord or most important as he underlined employees of the industry <e> <s> of course we shall watch their reactions with great interest <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies and i should like to underline what i said earlier that the health promotion agency is the only special agency planned at present <e> <s> if i have any other plans i shall naturally come before your lordships to discuss them in due course but as i say i have none at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord fitt is absolutely right <e> <s> he will see from my letter which he had in his hand that i regard any question as fair game <e> <s> i appreciate that this very wide-ranging debate could have been even more wide-ranging <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken for their concern in putting those points which they regard as important <e>", "<cs> it has not to my knowledge but i repeat the point that this matter has been explored twice very thoroughly <e> <s> therefore there would need to be real evidence <e> <s> i cannot say at the moment whether that letter provides such evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate <e> <s> it has been particularly interesting for me as it is the first debate on this subject that i have had the privilege of answering in this house <e> <s> it ranged over a number of issues of fundamental importance as the noble lord lord prys-davies said <e>", "<cs> my lords before answering the supplementary question of the noble lord perhaps i may congratulate him on his birthday which i believe is today <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer was not intended to nor indeed did i believe that it did give any hint that i disapproved of the feelings of the prison officers association <e> <s> all responsible sections of the community will be thankful to the northern ireland prison service and the very men about whom the noble lord is talking for thwarting this potentially very serious escape attempt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree that this is a long overdue amendment to the road traffic legislation in northern ireland <e> <s> the noble lord said that article would not be agreeable to trespassers and article would not be agreeable to fare dodgers <e> <s> i do not think that anyone in your lordships house would want to be agreeable to those two classes of person <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i give the undermaking that the department will reflect on that point <e> <s> my experience of northern ireland does not yet allow me to say how regularly these transport miscellaneous provisions orders arise but as i said i undertake that the department will reflect on the point made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i assure him that no apology for not giving me prior warning of his questions is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would be prepared to contain his soul in patience for just a little longer i think that in my rather roundabout way i shall be able to address that point <e> <s> i was talking about the staff <e> <s> approximately staff will be in the new agency <e> <s> i can give the noble lord liter if i may be allowed to a list of those organisations from which they are emanating <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not believe that my honourable friend has conducted himself in any way improperly in that regard <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i regret to say that that is the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the board is to be responsible for advising the minister and the agencys chief executive who incidentally will be answerable to the minister on the formulation and implementation of training and employment policy and for seeking increased collaboration between employers and the agency <e> <s> i believe that that is the real reason for there being a preponderance of employer representatives on the board as opposed to trade union representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i may well have said what the noble lord lord blease has just suggested <e> <s> however i was responding to the noble baroness in terms in which i suspect she was thinking that there was no intended criticism in my statement of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed that may be so <e> <s> i have had some years experience of exchanging views both in public and in private with the noble baroness lady white <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for his attitude to and reception of the order <e> <s> in answering his general point i would say in return that by creating offences one stops public demonstrations and marches on behalf of organisations which use these despicable methods to achieve their objectives <e> <s> rather than giving them publicity one removes from them by proscription the possibility of publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of only two speeches this afternoon as i forecast at the beginning of this short debate a whole myriad of questions have been raised which i will do my best to answer <e> <s> there will inevitably be one or two on which i shall have to write to one noble lord or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who in spite of what he calls his limited knowledge has obviously gone through this order with a fine toothcomb <e> <s> i regret that i am unable to answer all his questions immediately <e> <s> however i shall try to answer some of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the situation is not as the noble lord describes <e> <s> advertising is carried on both in the making of the plan and in the redrawing of it <e> <s> however perhaps i should look at the matter <e> <s> i note the noble lords interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> it is always rather dicey for a minister introducing an order to say as i did that the order has universal approval <e> <s> the minister may then find that the wrath of the house comes down on his or her head <e> <s> this is not such an occasion and i commend the order universally to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the three noble lords for their comments on this debate <e> <s> over the past years contributions to this kind of debate by your lordships have always been most helpful and encouraging and none less so than today <e> <s> i am particularly glad for the support offered by noble lords for the political process on which my right honourable friend the secretary of state is engaged <e> <s> until dialogue among political parties in northern ireland results in institutions of government there which can command support on all sides of the community orders such as that now before your lordships are the only realistic way of continuing the government of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to thank him for his comment that this is a brief but effective order <e> <s> i believe that the review of local government boundaries is independent and impartial <e> <s> it is proposed in the interests of sound effective and convenient local government in northern ireland <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will agree with that sentiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether it is within the rules of your lordships house for me to respond to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not know the answer for certain but my guess is that the order to which he referred was almost certainly needed as a result of the macrory reforms and the subsequent reorganisation of local government in the early s <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall certainly write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the constructive comments made during the brief debate on the order to which i shall endeavour to respond <e> <s> my noble friend lord lyell is quite right <e> <s> he has slightly bounced me and i shall have a little difficulty in obtaining an answer at the moment <e> <s> however i undertake to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes feel in your lordships house that my honour is being impugned <e> <s> however i shall of course make further inquiries and if my statement to the noble lord and the house has been inaccurate i shall enter into correspondence with him <e>"]
