["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer which has special relevance in view of the reported lack of success at a meeting yesterday between representatives of the eec and the international sugar organisation <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord for an assurance that her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join with those who paid tribute to the way in which the noble baroness has reintroduced this bill <e> <s> it must be a daunting task to do it again but it gives us the chance of looking again at the principle of the bill having already considered in committee what can be done to improve its details <e> <s> before getting on to my main points i should like to touch on the argument that has been advocated in favour of the bill that because there will always be some people related by affinity who will in any case live together the law should be changed to allow them to be legally married <e> <s> and here there is the very important point of children <e> <s> i believe that this argument although superficially attractive is a dangerous one as the noble earl lord lauderdale has said <e> <s> i felt that if one took it a stage further one might as well say that because some people will in any case commit adultery the law should be changed to legalise bigamy <e> <s> i should not like to be misunderstood i am not equating the two things morally but there is a connection in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put a question to him <e> <s> is he implying that those who are on the other side from him are interested only in protecting institutions or principles for the sake of the principles or institutions themselves and not the individual people who are protected by those institutions or principles <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for the opportunity to take part in this debate on this important report <e> <s> it is a debate that has already been graced by one admirable maiden speech <e> <s> i should like to join those noble lords who have paid tribute to the work of the williams committee <e> <s> whatever one thinks of their recommendations it is quite clear what they recommend and why and a great deal of work must have gone into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord sudeley for initiating this debate and to commend him for the competent way in which he introduced it <e> <s> i should like also to say how much i appreciate the english tourist board report which is full of information and is a help to the problem <e> <s> i am afraid i must talk about that dreariest of subjects inflation but i make no apology for doing so because those whom i have consulted and whose work it is to operate in cathedrals tell me that this is at the root <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as an amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> i wish also to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> e and f <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his comments on my amendment <e> <s> i think one small point is worth mentioning <e> <s> it might be a case if the worse came to the worst not of passing from one partner to another but of one lirm of brokers having to pass the business over to another broker <e> <s> i would like to study the noble viscounts other remarks further <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there seem to me to be two aspects to your lordships debate today <e> <s> first there is the effect on mr berry and mrs ward as individuals of any decision on the bill <e> <s> secondly there are the wider implications of that decision <e> <s> it is on the wider aspects that i should like to offer a few thoughts <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that an additional way to deal with the rubella problem would be to ensure that all women undergoing fertility treatment are tested for rubella immunity before undergoing such treatment <e> <s> can the minister state whether this is standard practice in national health service clinics at least <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to offer any view on the principle of the clause or indeed on scottish opinion on it i am not qualified to do so <e> <s> on the procedural question i have one remark to make which is that if no less a person than the right honourable secretary of state was under the impression that the debate concerned merely a carbon copy of the english act then there is a case for asking the other place to look once more at the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by supporting the remarks made by two earlier speakers first the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham who remarked that we are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her intervention <e> <s> i think that this is a matter of judgment <e> <s> i believe that to pass this bill would in effect not only make this kind of filial abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords again i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i am not thinking only of the sexual kind of abuse <e> <s> one can also imagine cases where a step-father has a relationship where the child is obedient and expects to obey the parent when it comes to the question of marriage the step-father may well abuse that obedience on the part of the child in order to persuade the child into marriage <e> <s> it is that of which i am thinking not just the sexual side <e> <s> i believe that to pass this law implies some measure of societys approval of that sort of conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving me the opportunity to emphasise the point <e> <s> i did not say that it was alien simply to marry his step-daughter i said that it was alien for a man to marry someone who had been the child of his own household who had grown up in his household and to whom he had acted as parent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too look forward with interest to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord noel-buxton <e> <s> in his very clear introduction of the bill the noble lord lord trefgarne drew attention to the length of the bill and to the undesirability of making further additions to it and i appreciate that <e> <s> however i would crave the indulgence of your lordships for a few minutes while i refer to one matter that has already been raised by the noble lords lord ponsonby of shulbrede and lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i had hoped to see provisions to deal with the problems and the uncertainties that can be caused to companies when strategic stakes are built up in their share capital in particular by parties acting in concert when the company is not kept fully informed as to what is going on <e> <s> as a stockbroker i have a special interest in this matter since uncertainties of this kind lead to disorderly markets and make it harder for me to advise my clients and to act for them to their best advantage <e>", "<cs> may i follow the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton on his last point dealing with possible insider dealing <e> <s> section of the companies act provides that persons in possession of non-published price-sensitive information are unable not only to deal themselves but also to counsel and procure another person to deal in the securities concerned <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble and learned lord could say whether it is the governments opinion that that section covers directors acting collectively as a board and if he would give an assurance that this particular point will be the subject of further discussions which will take place with the relevant bodies <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the reply given by the minister and i readily beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour and privilege to congratulate the noble lord lord dacre of glanton on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i first became aware of his scholarship with his book <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him to clarify one point <e> <s> he spoke about endless combinations and permutations <e> <s> why would it make it better to have in the bill a provision that there should be alternation between the book of common prayer and the alternative service books <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for drawing attention to the right of the citizen to invoke the criminal law as an important constitutional right and constitutional safeguard <e> <s> clearly this is a right which from time to time has to be limited in for example such matters as national security but i think we should look very closely at any attempt to widen the deprivation of the citizen of the right to invoke the criminal law <e> <s> in fact i think it was a mistake to do it with the protection of children bill and i think there were other cases where it could well have been left where it was the citizen with his right <e> <s> otherwise we run the danger that this kind of matter will be decided behind the closed doors of officialdom rather than in a court of law <e>", "<cs> my lords what comes across to me clearly is that the present position as regards the existing law on sunday trading is unsatisfactory and should not be allowed to continue <e> <s> to this extent the house i am sure is very grateful to the noble baroness lady trumpington for having brought the subject up once again <e> <s> whether her answer is the right one is in my view a very different question <e> <s> what is needed is a law that takes account of changes in society that is practicable and enforceable but one that also preserves the character of sunday so far as possible <e> <s> it is on that aspect that i should like to address a few remarks to your lordships <e> <s> i have no argument against the bill on the first two counts <e> <s> on the third i believe that it is far too drastic and would cause a certain amount of damage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer some remarks on clause and schedule <e> <s> i appreciate the governments response to the local <e>", "<cs> my lords i too share the general sympathy with the aims of the bill but should just like to say a few words on the wider issues following in that respect the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e> <s> i take the view that to consider each bill in isolation might lead to a pitfall <e> <s> whatever your lordships house decides in respect of this bill and indeed the other bill to be considered today i believe that we need to be careful that in passing personal bills we do not undermine the principle that is at the heart of the matter <e> <s> in the statement of reasons for the bill it is submitted that <e>", "<cs> i want just to take up one point mentioned by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i can well understand how people can hold varied views on the amendment but how anyone can say that cruelty is not involved i cannot understand <e> <s> if we were dealing just with immorality that would be one thing but in my submission it is the sadistic aspect of some sexual material which is the serious aspect of this problem <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> of course i am only too glad to take his advice <e> <s> on that condition therefore i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill aims to deal with those who run the pornography trade and make money out of it <e> <s> as indicated yesterday in the highly instructive speech made by the lord chief justice lord lane this is the right target <e> <s> in his interesting speech today the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwell based his reservations on the need to legislate to make people good <e> <s> this is not what this bill aims to do <e> <s> it aims to control a multimillion pound industry and there is nothing particularly strange about that it is a perfectly normal procedure <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl lord longford for that intervention <e> <s> indeed that is quite right <e> <s> i wonder whether it ought not to come in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady trumpington for those final remarks and i am also grateful to other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> to deal with one or two points that have been raised the original objection raised by the noble baroness lady trumpington that this would raise technical complications is in a way more the problem of the sponsor of the bill than my problem <e> <s> it is the noble baroness who is sweeping away the present law and creating a number of problems solving some i agree and all we can do is put down amendments to the best of our ability and at a subsequent stage resolve any difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this short debate on my amendment <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness lady trumpington for the detailed and courteous way in which she replied <e> <s> i think an important principle is involved here <e> <s> also i think there is something in what the noble lord lord jacques has said in that the extra freedom which will be given to consumers owners and proprietors of shops will carry a price and part of the price will fall in the area of job security <e> <s> no one can tell how my amendment would work out but i believe it would significantly enhance the job security of those who feel in the way i have described on religious grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the bill so ably introduced by the noble lord lord henley <e> <s> i shall not be entering into the argument between the respective claims of cracks and hacks <e> <s> there are many other noble lords who have far more experience and knowledge of these two very important national interests <e> <s> but i should like to pick up the remark that the noble lord lord henley made on sunday racing when he said that the bill gave provision for sunday racing subject to a change in the general law and the approval of the conservators and the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i share the general feeling of thanks to the noble lord lord davies of leek for initiating this debate on such an important subject which has so many aspects which concern us greatly and which perhaps concern us in a different way from the developing world but are still of vital importance to us and are problems that we cannot afford to brush away <e> <s> the noble lord lord davies of leek referred to the need for family planning and i would wholeheartedly support him in that <e> <s> i would also support the plea made by the noble baroness lady seear for increased aid for family planning <e> <s> my concern is that family planning should be on the right basis <e> <s> my aim in taking part in this debate is to urge that in matters of population control and family planning the encour <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house and the minister for not being in my place when these amendments were called <e> <s> with so many what looked like controversial amendments ahead of them i gravely miscalculated the time when i ought <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend section of the abortion act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> what a happy coincidence it is that this is the day of st nicholas or santa claus the patron saint of children for this is a bill about children <e> <s> in this connection <e> <s> i should like straight away to clear up a misconception <e> <s> it is claimed by some that the only issue at stake is the right of freedom of choice of women to control their own fertility <e> <s> this claim is based on a serious error <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is aware that professor peter huntingford who refused to fill in the new notification forms certifying that there were medical grounds when no action was taken against him by the dpp stated on mid-morning radio medway that he was pleased by the statement of the attorney general that he was not to be proceeded against because <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely thank all those of your lordships who have taken part in this debate for their excellent contributions throughout the evening <e> <s> i hope that as the hour is late your lordships will not think me discourteous if i do not answer all the points that were made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for his answer it seems to me to be disappointing that the government are taking a back seat <e> <s> do the government fully appreciate that the reason why the vast majority of christians and i believe i can say christians of every denomination feel so strongly about the present situation is because they believe that the unborn children whose lives are being taken are persons created by god and known by him and entitled to our protection <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government see it as their duty to protect life as including or excluding the unborn child <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government are prepared to look at the specific question of late abortions <e>", "<cs> i rise to put the case for a two-year time bar <e> <s> i enter your lordships discussions with considerable trepidation <e> <s> i find much in the bill to welcome and i accept that it is largely a tidying-up operation <e> <s> i would not have spoken at all in committee had it not been that a number of organisations have expressed concern to me and much of this concern stems from the proposal to reduce the time bar to one year <e>", "<cs> clearly i am persuaded by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor but i must weigh against that the eloquent speeches of support from noble lords on all sides and the opinion of organisations in the pastoral field <e> <s> may i just say that we are legislating for vulnerable people who are subject to tremendous pressures from the media and other sources which portray <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this short debate and i am grateful to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for the detailed and courteous way in which he dealt with my amendment <e> <s> perhaps i could just correct one point of fact in the speech of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> the idea of giving the high court power to issue a general order to vary the period between a decree <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord ashbourne on his speech <e> <s> we must all admire his clarity and conviction and the concise nature of his remarks <e> <s> i welcome the bill and i am very grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for the way in which he has presented it to the house <e> <s> it brings a measure of much needed control to the video industry <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has said much of that industry adds to our enjoyment of life <e> <s> unfortunately one sector of it produces material that can only be described as frightening and harmful as those of us who have seen examples of it can vouch <e> <s> just as there are controls on the supply of chemicals that might poison the body it is surely right that there should be controls on material that might poison the mind <e>", "<cs> may i take the opportunity to ask the noble lord lord elton for clarification of the governments position on one point in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that your lordships committee is almost unanimously clear that there is a huge difference between classifying a film for viewing in a cinema or club and classifying a video which can be viewed anywhere including in the home <e> <s> this point must be made by the bill as indeed it is made in clause l <e>", "<cs> may i say a word about the banning of private prosecutions <e> <s> all i need to do is to remind the committee of the wise words spoken by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale in <e> <s> at col <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the minister that the argument is not all one way <e> <s> i oppose the amendment for the following reasons <e> <s> the television authorities are feeling unnecessarily threatened and slighted <e> <s> we need go back only an amendment or two to what my noble friend lord howard of henderskelfe said that the classification of videos for home viewing is a totally different matter from the control of material to be broadcast over the networks <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to be very brief <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the thoughts behind these two groups of amendments <e> <s> i must say that i thought licensed sex shops were set up in for the very purpose of dealing with this sort of material we are considering <e> <s> i do not see that amendment no <e> <s> by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is a runner until we know more about it <e> <s> who is going to do the licensing <e> <s> under what arrangements will the licences be given <e> <s> what is the actual purpose for which they would be licensed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the government for giving your lordships house the chance to debate the warnock report <e> <s> there is a great deal in the report to be praised and i should like particularly to thank the authors for the clarity with which they set out the problems and proposals <e> <s> i should also like to pay tribute to those medical scientists who have developed medical techniques to relieve would-be parents of the wretched condition of infertility <e> <s> the question which faces society now is how those techniques can be channelled into beneficial areas and avoid creating harmful results which could far outweigh the benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords who have expressed understanding indeed sympathy with the two people concerned with this bill <e> <s> whatever happens to the bill in your lordships house i hope that they will find happiness for the rest of their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords my aim is to say why i am against this bill <e> <s> i propose to centre my remarks on the very real problem of the severely handicapped and the chronically sick especially elderly people <e> <s> although i do not agree with the bills answer to the problem i acknowledge that those who support the bill are sincere in their desire to find a humane and compassionate answer to it <e> <s> i just do not believe that they have found the right answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord winstanley for raising this question <e> <s> we are not here to debate the merits or the demerits of abortion the act or the way it is used and misused <e> <s> all of us would however agree i believe that anything that could reduce the number of abortions is to be encouraged <e> <s> i should like to touch upon the guidelines for the provision of contraceptives to under-s <e> <s> there is one particular point among others that worries me and that i would wish to draw to your lordships attention <e> <s> i have seen it suggested that if a doctor other than the girls family doctor prescribes the pill then he should contact the childs gp <e> <s> i wonder whether this is a strong enough injunction particularly because the pill can clash with other medical conditions and with other medication <e> <s> i wonder therefore whether there are other areas of medicine where a doctor other than the childs gp would make a prescription and then not tell the childs gp <e> <s> not to do so seems to be a little irresponsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry not to have been present for the debate on tuesday <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the committee if i were to speak at this stage to amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and the name of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> my amendment has the same aim as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i marginally prefer amendment no <e> <s> but i should be more than happy to support amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> may i take up one point that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor made <e> <s> if the amendment went through and if there was doubt as to who was the father whether it was the donor or the husband could that not be established by a blood test <e> <s> i thought i heard in a debate on an earlier clause in this bill that the means of determining paternity by blood test was now so advanced that it would be almost certain to produce the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords there may well be much merit in this amendment but i should like to point out one fact namely that this is one of the specific subjects on which the dhss consultative paper that was published only last month <e>", "<cs> my lords the main question before us is how the childrens interest is best served <e> <s> i fear that it is not best served if we go out of our way to deceive the child concerned about its parentage <e> <s> that is not the way to build a sound parent-child relationship <e> <s> i dread to think what would be the effect on the child if and when he or she finally discovers that he or she has been deceived about his or her parentage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to take up one point made by the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris about the opinions of women <e> <s> before introducing my unsuccessful bill in to tighten up the abortion law i was written to by a number of women claiming to represent the views of other women <e> <s> i have no doubt that to a certain extent they did <e> <s> after the bills failure when any views were obviously expressed from the heart and not inspired by pressure groups i had or letters from women regretting its failure and two saying that the writers were glad that it had failed <e> <s> therefore we cannot be all that certain how the majority of women really feel on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the point made by the noble baroness lady faithfull that the child may be only may be the result of artificial insemination is to be found in the first three lines of clause which refer to a child born <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot match the expertise and skill of the two excellent maiden speakers and of other speakers <e> <s> my experience in racing has been confined to having a leg in three rather slow horses although they did win some races <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because of its effect on family life <e> <s> every working day i pass a betting shop which has a notice on the outside to that effect that no one under years of age is allowed on the premises <e> <s> therefore the husband will be in the betting shop while the wife will be left behind probably because she may not want to go to the betting shop <e> <s> the children are barred from it quite rightly in my view <e> <s> as a result the family is split <e> <s> this happens on saturdays and i believe we should not allow it to happen on sunday afternoons <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but i shall not expand on that <e> <s> i want to ask the noble lord lord graham of edmonton one question <e> <s> he speaks about <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the white paper in so far as it takes us a step nearer the legislation which is so urgently needed and i welcome the proposed establishment of a statutory licensing authority <e> <s> i further welcome the intention set out in the white paper to bring the embryo within the scope of the law from its fertilisation and despite what has been said i counsel caution in introducing the term pre-embryo <e> <s> to me it seems a contradiction in terms <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i apologise if i misled the house on the position in law <e> <s> but in the infant life preservation act the offence is to destroy the life of a child being capable of being born alive <e> <s> the weeks come into it in that there is a supposition built into that act that if the pregnancy has gone weeks then there is <e>", "<cs> my lords my starting point in considering both total deregulation of sunday trading and the near total deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble duke for bringing forward this bill which i entirely support <e> <s> at present there is no statute law to protect the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to explain why if your lordships house divides on the measure tonight i shall not vote against it as i did at the final meeting of the ecclesiastical committee <e> <s> first i wish to say something which i believe to be almost entirely irrelevant that is to say where i stand <e> <s> i believe that the measure is right in intention and if the general rule is waived only in really exceptional cases that it will work out right in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for introducing this bill with such clarity and fairness <e> <s> to realise with how much care and awe we need to approach this subject let us remember that we are dealing with part of gods creation <e> <s> the bible says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord queried my interpretation of the royal society fact sheet <e> <s> i quote from <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for raising the matter of abortion because the state of the abortion law is so unsatisfactory that it should be kept continually in the public eye <e> <s> i take part in this debate as an ordinary member of the church of england <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford i believe my views are a little more representative of the views of the general synod than his <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he answer my question about the methods which will be used for the late abortions which will become possible under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on clause of the bill <e> <s> it is with considerable diffidence that i speak in this debate on scottish affairs <e> <s> my chief claim to be connected with scotland is that i had the honour of serving for nearly years with a scottish regiment <e>", "<cs> it was my understanding of this amendment that in stipulating that treatment services covered by the bill should be given to specified women that did not mean that separate licences as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said would be needed for each individual woman <e> <s> my understanding is that one licence would be issued to cover the treatment services which could be given to any number of women whose names would have to be entered on the appropriate record <e>", "<cs> as i put my name to the amendment i believe that i ought to say a few words <e> <s> it is a pity that two important points have been combined in the one amendment <e> <s> one is the provision of treatment to unmarried women and the other is the question of aid and egg donation <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on one point <e> <s> it has been implied that people who underwent unauthorised treatment would be involved in criminality <e> <s> but that is not what the bill states <e> <s> if the amendment were passed the bill would provide that a licence cannot authorise placing an embryo in an unmarried woman <e> <s> on that basis it would be an offence to issue a licence authorising treatment which is banned by the bill or it would be an offence to carry out the treatment that is the placing of an embryo in an unmarried woman without a licence which would not be obtained <e> <s> but the people undergoing the treatment would not be committing an offence <e>", "<cs> i had done so <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and to the noble lord lord ennals for the comments they have made <e> <s> it is possible that we shall return to the matter on report to see whether this provision should be built into authoritys instructions so to speak <e> <s> however with that consideration in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up two points made by the noble and learned lord lord bridge of harwich <e> <s> first he said that he believed that the embryo was not a person in the first days <e> <s> the point is not whether or not one believes that it is but whether one knows that it is not <e> <s> unless one knows that the embryo is not a human being in the first days one cannot take the risk of carrying out research on him <e>", "<cs> i have been entrusted with moving amendment no <e> <s> and it may be to the advantage of the committee if i spoke to it now <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said that we could table amendments to schedule in order to discuss individual areas of research <e> <s> this is such an amendment <e> <s> it would exclude the development of methods for detecting the presence of gene or chromosome abnormalities in embryos before implantation <e> <s> what will be done with the information once it is available <e>", "<cs> i did not realise quite what i had started when i moved the amendment <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord walton of detchant and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord somers for his encouragement but i am also grateful for the explanation by the minister and the speech by the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> in the circumstances i think it is the wish of the committee that i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with the amendments that we are discussing and so it might be for the convenience of the committee if i were to speak to it now <e> <s> in doing so i am conscious that some fairly heavy -inch shells have been winging my way from the government front bench as we have gone along this afternoon <e> <s> the aim of the amendment is to ensure that by including the words by donation on the birth certificate children created through gamete donation would know the nature of their conception <e> <s> that will enable them if they so wish to invoke the provisions of clause to discover at the appropriate time further information about their genetic parentage <e>", "<cs> i listened to what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said with great interest <e> <s> one point worries me <e> <s> he said that if anyone was concerned about their origins they could apply under clause <e> <s> putting by donation on the birth certificate is a pointer that someone should be concerned <e> <s> there may be a less clumsy way of dealing with this problem than putting those words on a birth certificate but if we do not have some pointer in view then the only solution is for everyone when they reach the age of man or woman to write to the authority and say have you got anything for me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his comments on the amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> i should like to comment on something that the noble lady lady saltoun said about limiting the number of times a donor could donate <e> <s> that was the subject of amendment no <e> <s> which did not find favour with the committee <e> <s> however it would have helped with the problem <e>", "<cs> the right is not available in scotland but it is the basic right of the individual in england to take out private prosecutions except where it is specifically declared to be the opposite <e> <s> i can understand that in cases where national security is at stake there is a reason for limiting private prosecutions <e> <s> however merely because there may be frivolous prosecutions is no reason at all <e> <s> i am sure that the courts have ways and means of dealing with frivolous prosecutions <e> <s> i believe that parliament should look closely each time this right of the individual is whittled away <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two quick points <e> <s> first to take up a point made by the noble and learned lord lord bridge about the role of the law i believe that he will agree with me that one of the great roles of the law is to protect the weak <e> <s> i can think of no part of our human brotherhood which is weaker and in <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply wanted to say that i thoroughly welcome the amendment and am grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for moving it <e> <s> my only reservation is that it is drawn in very broad terms and might be open to different interpretations in different parts of the country <e> <s> for that reason i hope that the house will look at other amendments which seek to tackle the same problem and to minimise it so that we obtain the best possible result <e>", "<cs> my lords it is worth looking at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken on the amendment and to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i am also glad that he has given us an assurance that the matter will be discussed when the code is formulated <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understood that point <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken but i am extremely disappointed by their views because i feel that serious moral problems are involved in this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the noble lord lord craigmyle for having spoken on the amendment <e> <s> we are in a slight tangle on the subject which will be quite difficult to unravel <e> <s> i have no doubt that that can be done <e> <s> the only lesson that comes out of this to me is that aid is an intrusion on family life which will produce these tangles <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the fact that we have legislation to control human fertilisation and embryo research <e> <s> i also join with other noble lords in thanking and paying tribute to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his sensitive piloting of this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord walton spoke as though amendment no <e> <s> a tabled by the noble baroness lady cox would ban some late abortions <e> <s> can he tell me where that appears in the amendment because i do not believe that it does <e>", "<cs> my lords everything i was going to say in my speech has already been said <e> <s> noble lords will therefore be glad that i can put my speech away and not weary them by going over the same points <e> <s> i should like to say one thing <e> <s> if the commons amendment goes through unamended there will be more perhaps not very many more late abortions <e> <s> as a result one will see in hospital in the same ward as a woman being nursed very carefully and kept extremely quiet in the hope of prolonging her pregnancy long enough for the child to be born capable of living a woman coming in for a late abortion of a healthy fetus <e> <s> in the same wing of the hospital there will be children born prematurely in intensive care and healthy fetuses or what were healthy fetuses on their way to the incinerator <e> <s> that is absolute madness <e> <s> i believe that the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady cox would ameliorate the position <e> <s> i therefore hope that it will be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a question to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> if the intention was to save the life of the mother why did the committee not recommend that in its recommendations rather than adopting the woolly and ambiguous formula in commons amendment no <e> <s> under subsection c <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three very short points to make <e> <s> first it may have been of help to us if the government had defined the phrase seriously handicapped which is used in commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe that they are unable to do so <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor may wish to comment on that <e> <s> secondly i ask him whether he would like to comment if he is able to do so on the position of the doctor who delivers a child and finds that it is seriously handicapped <e> <s> does the doctor have to bring the child to birth and see that it stays alive or can he take another course <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in the debate and i shall therefore be brief <e> <s> i must point out to the noble and learned lord lord brightman that subsection c does not mention saving the life of the mother <e> <s> it would allow an abortion if <e>"]
