["<cs> my lords i ask your customary indulgence which i am sure that i shall need on addressing this house for the first time and perhaps especially for addressing your lordships on a subject which in the last few days has become one of public controversy <e> <s> i can only hope that although the subject is controversial i shall be able to handle it in an uncontroversial manner merely remarking in this preliminary personal apologia that as a doctor of divinity and a regular worshipper in the chapel of which i have the honour to be the ordinary i do not quite understand the personal remarks about my non-attendance at church made by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first to follow him from these benches i should like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lord campbell of alloway on his elegant interesting and well-balanced maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure i speak for the whole house in saying that we look forward to hearing him speak here often and perhaps more particularly when he is released from those constraints of judicial impartiality which are imposed on those who make their maiden speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to speak briefly not only for myself as an historian but also on behalf of other historians who have been in touch with me and who are concerned by what seem to them the inadequacies of this white paper <e> <s> i need not emphasise the dependence of historians all kinds of historians on the public records <e> <s> and not only historians <e> <s> those records are not merely of academic or conservationist interest as the white paper somewhat condescendingly seems to suggest <e> <s> they are as historians recognise vital to ensure continuity of policy-making in the present <e> <s> we have heard of the amount of paper which annually goes into the public record office but it is also fetched out of it <e> <s> every year i understand government departments recall files over years old from the public record office apart from referring to old files which they have never sent there <e>", "<cs> my lords considering that so far as i can understand there is no particular problem which is not soluble within the present system can my noble friend say what is the ultimate central overriding purpose of an operation which really transforms the british museum reading room from an historic centre of scholarship into a kind of community centre thus breaking with tradition and effectively interrupting rather than forwarding the purposes which have made the british library so useful and famous in the past <e>", "<cs> i think that the main point of flexibility is agreed by all speakers <e> <s> the noble earl has said that this will be taken into account and therefore i would ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure the commission will set up specialist committees i cannot see how it would function properly if it did not <e> <s> perhaps it is true that we are being unnecessarily restrictive <e> <s> i must admit i would prefer to see in the bill a mandatory clause requiring that committees be set up <e> <s> i am not prepared for my own part to press this <e> <s> compromise has been suggested i wish i could think of some compromise <e> <s> if i may leave it with the noble earl to consider we can think about it again at report stage <e> <s> for my part i would be willing to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of that explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that i suppose we have to be content <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment of the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> i do so basically for two reasons first because i do not think that this house ought to be the stalking horse the guinea pig the thin end of the wedge whatever you may call it of the other place and secondly and more importantly because i think with the noble lord <e> <s> lord strauss that the whole proposal is misguided <e> <s> the house of lords should serve the public interest and not the entertainment industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not merely a question of dignity i think there is an important issue in itself <e> <s> the televising of our proceedings may not damage the house it may not damage us individually but what is its advantage <e> <s> surely the question that we ought to ask is not what harm can it do <e> <s> but what is the public utility of it <e> <s> we are here in our public capacity to serve the public not merely to yield <e>", "<cs> my lords finding myself to my surprise the first to follow the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i am glad to take this opportunity of being the first to congratulate him on introducing a debate on this important subject <e> <s> i have to be very tentative for we are moving in a world of cloaks and daggers false names and false identities but i think that i may be the only person here who has actually worked in both mi and mi <e> <s> admittedly that was a long time ago and in rather special circumstances <e> <s> but after all the skeletons which come tumbling out of our cupboards to enjoy their periodical ritual dance all date from that time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord <e> <s> lord annan sits down may i correct a small point <e> <s> i never suggested or at least i never meant to <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is intituled <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment basically for the same reasons that have been advanced by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> frankly this blanket veto is absurd and unworkable <e> <s> i should declare an interest <e> <s> i am a former member of the intelligence service <e> <s> as such i suppose i fall under the ban <e> <s> i have only my own experience to draw on <e> <s> former members of the intelligence service are called upon frequently quite publicly and openly to give an account of events a long time ago admittedly <e> <s> but there is no terminus in the clause there is no -year rule <e> <s> members are banned for ever <e> <s> i am afraid however that we do not pay any attention to that ban <e> <s> let us face the facts <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment which was drafted by my noble friend lord bethell and proposed by my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton because i believe that if it were adopted it would be helpful not only to those <e>", "<cs> my lords we all deplore the financial constraints that are depressing the income status and morale of university teachers in this country and are thereby alienating so many of them from the government <e> <s> this massive alienation has been illustrated in this debate and must surely be heeded by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the ufc was developing a methodology to measure research output <e> <s> for that purpose it solicited appropriate data in four specific subjects to be a model for annual returns <e> <s> the appropriate data are to be assembled by an appropriate bibliometrical methodology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in favour of this amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> i did so as a layman for what i think are purely a laymans reasons <e> <s> this amendment will have a good effect in that in one sense it will prevent publication <e> <s> when i listened to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i kept thinking to myself what about irangate <e> <s> my noble friend kept referring to the necessity of covering up admitted possible malpractices within the secret services on the grounds that it was better to cover them up in the public interest than to reveal them in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a very distinguished speech for which we are all grateful but the noble lord lord callaghan will forgive me if i am brief on compliments in view of the brevity of the time which is allowed to all of us <e> <s> i must also be brief on qualifications which might otherwise be introduced <e> <s> such brevity simply requires one to be more summary than one would like to be <e>", "<cs> my lords in the recent debate on german reunification the noble lord who introduced it touched lightly in summing up on the timidity or hesitancy of historians in approaching that subject <e> <s> we are perhaps a rather timorous breed <e> <s> that is not because we are incapable of enthusiasm <e> <s> i do not think anyone could have watched the series of revolutions that has appeared on television recently without emotion <e> <s> that was the first time that one could watch revolutions happening before ones eyes <e> <s> however if we are slightly reserved in our attitude and we correct our emotions it is because by the nature of our profession we have been there before <e> <s> we have seen the euphoria of past revolutions followed sometimes quite quickly by disillusion and reaction sometimes even by terror and war <e> <s> we have seen followed by followed by and folowed by <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments have been well rehearsed and i do not wish to repeat them <e> <s> i am in total agreement with everything said <e>"]
