["<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house might find it useful if i seek to sketch the reasoning which lies behind the recommendations of the committee which i had the honour to chair <e> <s> ample evidence emerged to convince it that there were many charities within the order of reference of the committee which were not effective and the committee identified the causes of this ineffectiveness as threefold <e> <s> first a woeful lack of accountability on the part of charity trustees <e> <s> secondly the difficulties and complications in the way of updating obsolete charitable trusts <e> <s> thirdly an ineffectiveness flowing from the sheer smallness of the funds at the disposition of the trustees <e> <s> it was the task of the committee to search for an acceptable solution for those problems <e>", "<cs> may i say a brief word against this amendment <e> <s> the trustees will already be required to send their accounts centrally to the charity commission <e> <s> one single local filing centre would seem to be adequate for all reasonable purposes <e> <s> the scheme of the bill is to make the appropriate local authority the local filing centre <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not really a necessary burden to impose on charity trustees that they have to file their accounts a second time locally <e> <s> it should be sufficient for the parish council to ask the local authority for a copy of the accounts under clause <e>", "<cs> there is a statutory period for the retention of accounts by charity trustees but i think i am correct in saying that there is no statutory period for the retention of accounts by the charity commissioners <e> <s> i have been informed by the charity commissioners that in fact they retain accounts of charities indefinitely and that they have never yet thrown away a set of accounts <e>", "<cs> i think that this amendment does reflect what was intended by the bill and if i may speculate i think it is quite likely that the committee would have inserted those words if it had thought of them in time <e> <s> although it is perhaps not for me to support the amendment i see no harm in it whatever <e>", "<cs> i would respectfully ask that this amendment be not agreed to because subsection is intended indeed to spell out what is meant by <e>", "<cs> the exercise of the unique powers given to the trustees by clauses and is intended to be non-controversial <e> <s> if the powers can be exercised by a majority of the trustees perhaps against the wishes of a forceful minority then controversy will be introduced into the exercise of those powers <e> <s> if there is to be controversy i suggest that it is more appropriate that it should be dealt with either through the courts or through the charity commission and not by the exercise of these rather exceptional powers proposed for clauses and <e> <s> i suggest that it is not appropriate in the context of this legislation to allow a matter which may be in dispute between the trustees to be decided by a majority against perhaps a protesting minority <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the select committees approach to clause <e> <s> the committee were very deeply divided at one time as to what was the proper monetary limit to put into the clause <e> <s> there was a great deal of discussion and a great deal of disagreement <e> <s> in the end we came to the view which perhaps on the surface might be thought a little surprising that we should keep the sum as low as we possibly could <e> <s> the type of considerations which we had in mind were that as a general rule the problems of trustees of a very small charity would be able to be solved by an amalgamation under clause <e> <s> clause is really a last resort where the charity fund is so small that it would be unreasonable to put the trustees to all the expense and trouble of trying to find a suitable transferee charity unless one were close at hand and easily identified <e> <s> so we thought that we could safely keep the sum specified in clause down to a low figure <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will not think that the machinery if it can be called that set up by clause is either long or complicated if it is then the bill is failing in its purpose <e> <s> it is intended to be very simple and to enable a member of the public probably a resident in the locality to bring the matter to the attention of the charity commissioners so that they can take the simple action open to them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add one word against this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord maude said if i heard him correctly that the effect of clause would be to condemn hundreds of small charities to a useless existence <e> <s> under clause the trustees of every small charity are open to transfer their tiny fund to another larger and effective charity <e> <s> i suggest that it is preferable that small charities should be encouraged to transfer their funds to a large charity rather than that we should give them the power to disperse their funds and thus lose them to charity <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for having misunderstood him <e> <s> in my respectful submission there would be no difficulty in a small charity however small transferring its funds to a large charity <e> <s> the small fund which is transferred is not under the terms of the bill kept as a separate fund <e> <s> it becomes an accretion to the existing fund <e> <s> from the point of view of accounting it is lost forever <e> <s> it causes no trouble whatever to the transferee charity <e> <s> i suggest that the figure which appears in clause should be left as it is <e> <s> there is really no reason to raise the level in clause as it stands <e>", "<cs> i first apologise for not having developed the arguments in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i had wrongly assumed that they were self-evident and required no introduction <e> <s> i apologise for my mistake <e>", "<cs> i agree with the remarks which the noble and learned lord has made <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to speak on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i entirely agree with what my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale has said <e> <s> in my submission it imposes a duty which is simply not justiciable <e> <s> it is too vague <e> <s> the undertakings are not defined <e> <s> i ask to whom were the undertakings given by whom were they given and on what occasion were they given <e> <s> i ask your lordships to reject amendment no <e> <s> as drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house would allow me to defer answering that question because i see that the time is passing and i have a little more which i feel bound to say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin a very short reply by thanking noble lords who have spoken so generously of the work of the special committee <e> <s> i am sure that all members of the committee will be very appreciative of the remarks which your lordships have made <e> <s> i am also grateful to all noble lords who have found time to attend this debate and for the invaluable contributions which speakers have made to the solution of this painful subject <e> <s> the committee welcome criticism of the report <e> <s> we do not suggest for one moment that our <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the committee which i had the honour to chair will be grateful for the kind remarks made by the noble earl lord arran and the noble lord lord dean of beswick on its handling of its task <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord hampton for his kindly tribute to my chairmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am at liberty to intervene but my understanding was that two i may be wrong in my numbers appointments were going to be offered to the council <e> <s> i intervene only to say that that was my recollection <e> <s> my noble friend lord blease may be able to support that recollection <e>", "<cs> i ask the committee not to accept the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> as i understand the amendments the effect would be that directors will be at liberty deliberately to act in excess of the powers contained in the memorandum of association <e> <s> the effect of that will be that a company might just as well tear up the objects clause contained in the memorandum because the limitation set out in the objects clause will neither bind a member of the public acting innocently nor a director who is acting deliberately in contravention of the constitution of the company <e> <s> i ask the committee not to accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> i take exactly the same view as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> on a brief reading it seems that the amendment is right <e>", "<cs> when i heard the debate on th february my clear impression was that the intention of the amendment was that the staged introduction of the scheme was to be discretionary and not mandatory <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief in what i have to say <e> <s> i do not intend to speak on the merits of the bill because other speakers are far better equipped than i to do so <e> <s> however i am greatly influenced by the fact that the government have promised to offer to parliament alternative sets of draft clauses fully compatible with a government bill to deal with the issue of research on human embryos <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel some anxiety about these proposed amendments <e> <s> the possibility of a public interest defence or iniquity defence as it is sometimes called fell to be examined by your lordships house in the <e>", "<cs> i rise not on a point of principle but on a point of detail <e> <s> i shall be brief <e> <s> i am puzzled by the purpose of subsection of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this provides <e>", "<cs> i am disposed to support the amendment because it is entirely a matter of discretion for the secretary of state or the director <e> <s> there is no obligation to impose conditions requiring the payment of penalties under the proposed amendment <e> <s> we know from a previous discussion that clause is wholly flexible and imposes no obligation on those concerned to include in the appointment the matters which are set out in clause <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that the amendment is innocuous from the point of view of the government <e> <s> it is purely a matter of discretion and imposes no duty whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by tendering my apologies for being absent at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i was engaged on an opposed private bill committee <e> <s> i welcome this debate because it enables me to ventilate a small point which i have aired in the past <e> <s> it relates to the evidence before the committees on opposed private bills <e> <s> paragraphs to at pages and of this most admirable report discuss the exchange by parties of written proofs of evidence that is to say the exchange by the parties of written statements of the evidence which will be given by their witnesses <e> <s> in paragraph the joint committee expressed the view with which i respectfully agree <e>", "<cs> my lords at second reading the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey was greatly concerned with the effect which the proposed move of the market might have on the spitalfields community <e> <s> i agree that this aspect is of vital importance <e> <s> as it says in its special report the committee was impressed by the sincerity and commitment of those residents and business people who desire to keep the market at spitalfields <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to say why another select committee may have taken a different line on planning matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this late stage <e> <s> if a tenant pays a rent which is inclusive of the domestic rate it seems to be common justice that the landlord should reduce the rent by the amount which he no longer has to pay <e> <s> i cannot believe that a provision to achieve this justice would be beyond the skill of the parliamentary draftsman <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there may be another problem which arises out of the proposed amendment <e> <s> a difficulty can arise under subsection which reads <e>", "<cs> i also appreciate the merits of the proposed amendment provided that associated employer means only that one employer is a wholly owned subsidiary of the other employer <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton whether that is his understanding of the amendment <e> <s> if so i suggest that associated employer should be defined in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill <e> <s> the ground has been very fully covered by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and there is little that i can usefully add <e> <s> i summarise the problem <e> <s> as the law now stands a trade union which calls its members out on strike in furtherance of a trade dispute affecting that union is protected from an action for damages by the employer provided that the strike has been authorised by a ballot of the members concerned <e> <s> that protection is lost unless the strike begins within days of the voting <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether the government would be prepared to consider the addition at the end of clause of such words as <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the amendment is that it does not seek to give any legal enforceability to such an agreement but merely to give a local authority a discretion to provide accommodation <e> <s> as it is purely discretionary in that way it seems to me that it is in no way in conflict with subsection <e> <s> i respectfully suggest to the house that this amendment is perfectly innocuous <e> <s> it is entirely discretionary it is in no conflict with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to say a few words about and stress the urgent need for reform in the field of charity <e> <s> after reminding us that no licence is required from the charity commissioners before a charity can appeal for funds the report of sir philip woodfield referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords the luke-warm response of the government to this bill when it was introduced in the last session appears to me to be based upon an assumption that an employer who challenges the validity of a strike is unlikely to appeal a decision against him or if he does appeal that the proceedings will certainly be concluded within days <e>", "<cs> my lords i approach this debate with the conviction that the abortion act is flawed out of date and needs reconsideration and amendment <e> <s> the problem is how that is to be achieved <e> <s> that the act is flawed is explained in the report of the select committee which i had the honour to chair in and <e>", "<cs> my lord before the noble lord sits down i should like to correct him on one point <e> <s> he told your lordships that if there is serious danger to the health of siblings it will be permissible under the bill to abort the child at any gestational age <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> clause ab provides that abortion on the grounds of serious danger to the health of siblings is forbidden after week <e>", "<cs> i entirely support the bill <e> <s> however i feel that i ought to enter a caveat on the wording of the amendment <e> <s> it occurred to me rather late in the day otherwise i should have had a word with the noble lord lord mccarthy about it <e>", "<cs> i envisaged that the bill would be amended in committee in the form which was advocated by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i was seeking that a further amendment be brought at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill qualifies for a mention in the <e>", "<cs> i must comment on the last observation made by the noble lord <e> <s> i do not have the statistics to hand but i assure him that extremely few abortions take place in fact none of a child capable of being born alive save exceptionally where the child is an encephalic or for some other reason it is impossible for it to survive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my enviable privilege and my very great pleasure to be the first to congratulate the noble baroness lady hollis of heigham and to be the second to congratulate the noble baroness lady cumberlege on their elegant instructive and witty maiden speeches <e> <s> i should add that this is also my own maiden exercise of that privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may say that in my opinion the date of application would be construed by a court as meaning the date when the application was received by the holder of the record to whom it is addressed <e> <s> i would not regard it as essential to amend the wording in order to clarify any ambiguity <e>", "<cs> my lords the commons amendment reflects precisely the recommendations of the select committee <e> <s> it may be of some assistance to your lordships in making up your minds in this debate if i explain briefly how the committee reached its unanimous conclusion <e> <s> there were two issues before it <e> <s> the first was whether the maximum gestational age for an abortion should be reduced below weeks <e> <s> if so the question was whether any allowance ought to be made for emergency situations <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from memory i believe that subsection c exactly repeats the existing law <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> my argument was that amendment no <e> <s> a is unnecessary because under paragraph a it deals only with a termination at a time when a viable child is not to be expected and under paragraphs b and c when the life of the child will be preserved by the doctor anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down perhaps he will allow me to correct one mistake <e> <s> he said that the amendments from the commons drastically altered the bill of the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> in fact they exactly reproduce that bill and the committees recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment relating to the seriously deformed child says this <e> <s> in the case of a termination because of a substantial risk of serious abnormality the doctor is required to take all reasonable steps to secure that the child is born alive provided first that the child is capable of being born alive and secondly that the child is not suffering from a handicap incompatible with life <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to perpetuate in the abortion act the reference to the infant life preservation act contrary to the unanimous recommendation of the select committee <e> <s> the point is a little complicated and perhaps i may be forgiven if i say just a few words by way of preface <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes but only in the exceptional circumstances laid down by those paragraphs that is to save the life of the mother to save her being a permanent invalid and to save her from having to bear to full term a child who is diagnosed as seriously handicapped <e>"]
