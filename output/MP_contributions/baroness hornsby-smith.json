["<cs> in the absence of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls who i know would have liked to join issue with the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton i should like to raise one or two points which the noble lord made <e> <s> the noble lord seems to expect noble lords in this committee to believe that contracting out is free and easy <e> <s> if he does he is living in cloud cuckoo land <e> <s> for years i was privileged to be a member of another place <e> <s> i had a large docker estate transferred from east london into the midst of my constituency <e> <s> i admit that i had a great minority of supporters in that area but not one of them dared contract out they would have been unable to join any of the gangs unloading ships if they had dared to say i do not want to support the labour party <e> <s> if the labour party genuinely believed that it was free and easy to contract in or out why did it not keep to contracting in if a man said i want to support the labour party <e> <s> i want to pay the labour levy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> it would appear from his answer that cases have not been brought against several of the state-trading countries <e> <s> would he not agree that this proves that the campaign against sanctions which is so loudly protested by some of those breaking them is really a case of them feathering their own nests and improving their own trade and thus denying us a valuable market which is traditionally ours <e> <s> is it not time we pursued cases against them and called their bluff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will join with me in congratulating the noble lord lord rhodes on having the initiative <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend not agree that all these schools have boards of managers or governors all of whom are bound to be consulted on the future of their schools <e> <s> all of those bodies include a very substantial number of parents who are chosen because they are highly responsible and well-known local parents with an interest in their childrens education <e> <s> it is not suggested that the comprehensive education be wiped out <e> <s> it is highly unlikely that any of these areas will lose comprehensive education entirely even if they decide that they wish to have grammar schools <e> <s> the choice of parents to send their child to a comprehensive school will still remain <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down both he and the noble baroness lady david have spoken against this clause <e> <s> the noble baroness remarked that the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill from the cross-benches had been firmly opposed to this bill and the noble lord lord donaldson also referred to two independent members <e> <s> anyone who heard the noble lord lord alexander speak could not have missed how adamant he was that we should provide the proper education to stretch the top per cent <e> <s> as we are prepared to provide for the handicapped at the bottom per cent <e> <s> and he made a most effective speech on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene for only one minute but the noble lord lord wells-pestell made a statement which i believe is quite inaccurate <e> <s> surely there has never been any vat on childrens clothing <e> <s> am i not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply i am frankly staggered by it because there have been representations on excesses of quota some of up to nearly per cent <e> <s> put by the industry to the eec <e> <s> whatever it is called whether it is exceeding the quota or whether it is breaking the understandings of the gatt and the multi-fibre agreement on unfair competition there is ample evidence that goods are coming from eastern europe at prices less than they cost <e> <s> following the reply to a question in the other place yesterday the noble lord must be aware that the american government is aiding its industry by ill-concealed subsidies on fuel costs that have had a disastrous effect in the imports into this country of carpets and polyester fibres which increased in the first eight months of this year by over ten times what they were in the whole of last year <e> <s> whether the noble lord calls it dumping or not it is not fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that reply and say that it will be very warmly received by the industry <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that so often when these representations are made there are inordinate delays before controls are instituted or the matter is dealt with <e> <s> as the number of garments which mauritius hopes to export this year is something over million it is very urgent for the industry that our representations should be dealt with quickly and the industry protected from this totally unfair competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> but is he satisfied particularly in relation to the west country ports that the fishing patrol vessels are adequate in numbers and speed to cope with the poaching that has been occurring in the last few weeks <e> <s> secondly in view of the speed with which this country implemented the recommendations regarding the mesh measurements of nets rightly i believe in view of the need to conserve fishing stocks will her majestys government press for similar action by other maritime powers in order to conserve fishing stocks and to give our fishermen a fair deal and prevent the poaching of immature fishing stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with considerable trepidation that i follow the bevy of legal minds who have spoken this afternoon but perhaps it is not a bad thing for an inquisitive layman to transgress into what looks as if it is going to be a lawyers paradise <e> <s> first may i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his most comprehensive explanation of the provisions of the bill and say that overall i certainly support it <e> <s> i am as committed to liberty and democratic rights as indeed any member of this parliament must be but equally i am firmly security-minded where the interests of this nation are concerned not just in defence to which the last two speakers would almost entirely have limited it but in international relations and also in regard to something vitally important to government interests and contracts in inventions industrial processes and brilliant research the disclosure of which could do irreparable damage to the future economic progress of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that when the multi-fibre agreement was renewed in december very firm assurances were given to industry that although the total package fell short of its requirements the quota levels negotiated including the ability to implement the basket extractor mechanism which gives rise to these appallingly over-excessive quotas would be considered under the renewal <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that poland exceeded its quotas by per cent <e> <s> in certain categories taiwan by per cent <e> <s> and hungary by per cent <e> <s> when will the obligations given under that renewal agreement operate and the controls made effective <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that hundreds of people are taking their prescriptions abroad when they go on holiday because the prices of frames are so much cheaper abroad <e> <s> indeed on a holiday myself on the tiny island of gozo the one and only optician reported that he had pairs previously ordered <e> <s> the lenses were ordered from england and came from there but the frames were one third and one half of the price of comparable frames here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but may i ask whether he will also bear in mind that for years the greek government have aided their textile export industry by tax concessions and other subsidies <e> <s> could we have some assurance that not only now but when they are fully in the eec these practices which are against the regulations of the mfa and indeed gatt will cease and will not continue producing such unfair competition <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he say whether entering the common market will make it necessary for the greek government to stop subsidising as they have done for some years by reduced taxation on goods exported in the textile industry <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to make a very sincere apology to the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i had to attend an important committee meeting in the other house and thought that i had tied up the arrangements to be telephoned the moment this motion began <e> <s> unhappily however the messenger who knew me from long ago went to tea and the gentleman who took his place did not know lady hornsby-smith from a bar of soap <e> <s> so i never got the message <e> <s> so i owe a very sincere <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has emphasised a point that saddens me very much that any regulation is immediately exploited as being anti-black when it is equally applied to aliens or commonwealth citizens whether they be black or white and from whatever part of the world they may come <e> <s> it is this deliberate exploitation which does so much harm to race relations <e> <s> in my experience immigration officers have a thankless job <e> <s> they have types of persons to look out for whom we have not even mentioned this afternoon criminals trying to get out of the country or people on the run trying to get in of whom they are told by interpol <e> <s> they are supposed to have eyes in the backs of their heads to try to find them poor chaps <e> <s> there are people who have already been sent out of this country and have a nefarious reputation in other respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble viscount for that reply may i ask whether he can give us any figures regarding the extent of our processing not by manufacturing industry as well as by manufacturing industry <e> <s> secondly what assurance is there that the proposed regulations now being discussed will prevent the possibility of non-manufacturing distributors sending fabric which may or may not have been made in this country to a clothing manufacturer abroad in a country whose exports to the eec are normally subject to duty and by using the outward processing formula evading full payment of duty and possibly exceeding the level of their quota <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the congratulations to the noble lord upon the very lucid statement he has given us and i am sure he will appreciate that with an item so complicated we shall require to spend a great deal of time in studying it line by line <e> <s> i should like to ask a very general question <e> <s> i understand that some countries were concerned in these negotiations <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us whether any significant exporter or group of exporting countries is not party to the agreement and will therefore not be hound by it but will be free to pursue its own methods <e> <s> further can he tell us in general terms whether the agreement while it provides for the reduction of tariffs gives any leeway on what is of great concern to many of the industrial nations namely the complete lack of reciprocity where the developing countries have a very free entry into the industrial nations and have complete embargoes on many items going into their countries <e> <s> is there any provision against the complete embargo as opposed to the reduction of tariffs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the minister for the very clear and detailed exposition he gave of the bill <e> <s> overall i firmly support him in the intention under <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i support my noble friend <e> <s> the noble lord lord jacques referred to the necessity for the price commission may i say that trade industry and the retail trade were delighted to see it go <e> <s> it was a good propaganda exercise for the former government but it only scratched the surface and made a very small dent in inflation <e> <s> it investigated only a tiny proportion of increases and it tended to <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will know that i am very unhappy with his answer because in view of all the burdens that trade and industry have to carry at present they really do not want the uncertainty of this provision when they are trying to promote their sales and increase industry <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will consider the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon namely whether or not some phrase such as he suggested could not be introduced during the report stage <e> <s> as my noble friend knows i feel very strongly about this issue <e> <s> however today i shall very reluctantly withdraw my amendment but <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is rather turning the arguments upside down <e> <s> the director general is to have enormous power it will be for him to decide in his wisdom and discretion <e> <s> surely the unfortunate firm has the right to know why what it is doing is not in the public interest <e> <s> it does not seem a very great request to make <e> <s> however we are now told that the director general has nothing to do with the public interest and that it is not for him to decide whether it is in the public interest <e> <s> i rather thought that that was what he was there for <e>", "<cs> with great respect i should like to raise one other point <e> <s> if we have to wait for the public interest decision by the monopolies and mergers commission will the minister give consideration to the enormous amount of time money and effort that has to be put into preparing a case for the monopolies commission <e> <s> might it not be possible at an earlier stage to prove and point out that such and such a practice is detrimental to the public interest without having to go through all that <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure it would be with the agreement of the committee in view of the fact that this amendment has almost exactly the same aim as my amendment no <e> <s> that i should say a few words on this and not move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> to say that there would be endless argument is no answer to somebody who has had to go to enormous expense and who has been proved guiltless of the representation made against him <e> <s> we are not asking for something new and unreasonable but for something already enshrined <e> <s> if an objector is successful in a town planning inquiry he can get reimbursement of costs <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will not expect me to welcome his reply but in view of the explanation he has given although i do not find it wholly satisfactory i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this will give some comfort to the firms <e> <s> is he also aware that an appalling number of suit manufacturing companies have already closed in this country <e> <s> can we be given some indication of how long these negotiations are likely to take and when we might have some resultant restriction on these grossly unfair imports <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that any lady buying paris fashions will be paying very heavily for them <e> <s> we are complaining about people here being put out of work because these goods are coming in way below the economic price <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount bear in mind that so long as firm after firm and a tragically large number have closed during the past year are closing down due to unfair competition and in many cases the failure of the eec to implement the safeguards and to take action against the breaches of the various international agreements it is hardly likely that the industry can have the confidence required to pour out millions of pounds in new capital investment <e> <s> can the government see that more prompt action is taken against breaches of the agreement which form one of the biggest complaints in the industry <e>", "<cs> would not my noble friend agree that this would fall particularly hard on those parents who want their children to go to particular denominational schools on account of their faith <e> <s> quite often there is adequate primary education for those who wish to go to a catholic or to a jewish or to a church of england school but this is not always possible when it comes to the secondary school <e> <s> if this embargo were to be imposed it would fall particularly hard on those who want their children to go to a particular school of their faith <e> <s> i am thinking of an experience i had in my old constituency <e> <s> when a child <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in welcoming the fact that the noble lord lord avebury took the opportunity to introduce the debate and thus give us a chance to debate this issue in your lordships house although he will not expect me to agree with much that he said <e> <s> when i listen to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> if the marriage is arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what the noble baroness had done in her particular position <e> <s> it is one thing to say that you do not condone selling a bride it is quite another thing to make it easy and possible which without these regulations it would be <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask her whether when they make this review of the cost the government will also take into account the number of people who have reached retirement age and a very substantial proportion of those who do now have an occupational pension as well who will be depriving those of employment age of jobs <e> <s> i do not think that this is the time to make it easy for people to continue to work many years after they have reached retirement age <e> <s> i have been fascinated by some of the comments made by noble lords opposite because my memory goes back to when i was in the ministry of pensions and national insurance <e> <s> then it was the trade unions who said in order to help employment you must not allow people to have their pension and work as well <e> <s> i should be very interested to know how many trade unions with unhappily many of their members unemployed would welcome the fact that people who not only have one pension but who have two pensions might continue to work thus depriving others of that employment <e> <s> i do not think that this is the time to do this <e>", "<cs> if my memory serves me correctly i believe that the amount of the weekly contribution used to be broken down and analysed certainly during the time when i served in the ministry <e> <s> we knew how much went to pensions and how much went elsewhere <e> <s> i believe that out of the total contribution a minute amount as small as an old penny went to death grant <e> <s> contributions have been increased in relation to pensions over the years as pensions have risen <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble baroness lady phillips i think she has missed the point <e> <s> those who made contributions as insured people were paying the contributions for different aspects of social benefit and a particular proportion of the weekly stamp was allocated to each <e> <s> it has been common practice for every government who felt it right and proper to raise pensions unemployment benefit or other benefits to raise the cost of the stamp <e> <s> i do not query who will claim these benefits because none of us will escape dying <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give us some assurance that when portugal gets tax free entry into our markets simultaneously we shall have more access to her markets against which we have had to suffer very high tariffs <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in the congratulations extended to my noble friend lord drumalbyn and his colleagues on the select committee for the very comprehensive report that they have produced <e> <s> in my view to have condensed such a complicated and diverse series of negotiations into so brief and factual a whole is a masterly achievement and my noble friend and his colleagues deserve our gratitude and congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether or not it is a fact that the british rail police insist upon policing their own railways and trains and that it is only when they are in trouble that they call in the metropolitan police or has that circumstance been altered <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the introduction of this bill again into your lordships house though in a slightly different form <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord inglewood on his persistence in sticking to his guns after the loss of the bill that he endeavoured to get through last year <e> <s> it would be an impertinence to add to the lucid explanation that he has <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that one of the biggest problems at the moment is shoplifting <e> <s> we are repeatedly seeing cases where foreign visitors with vast sums of money in their pockets are still shoplifting to the detriment of shopkeepers <e> <s> will he agree that it is against the wishes of the general public that because they happen to be visitors they should be treated more leniently than our own citizens <e> <s> am i right in thinking that my noble friend informed us that this lady had not only abused her conditions of landing by taking employment but had shoplifted as well <e> <s> although it is reprehensible that we had to keep her in prison would my noble friend agree that she would probably have gone off and done it again if we had not <e>", "<cs> my lords when the bill came in i was then i think the <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i feel that the background on which the present bill was passed then many of the offences occurred in the streets and the legislation was passed to stop the nuisance and soliciting in the street has been transferred to what i would call public places i refer to where somebody trespasses into somebody elses room in a hotel <e> <s> that is the basis of my reservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble lord a question though i should have liked to do so before he sat down <e> <s> bearing in mind the vital need to provide adequate services particularly in rural areas how on earth can services run by different operators work in a practical way if there is not co-operation concerning timetables and routes so that operators do not all run on the same route and at the same time <e> <s> surely co-operation is vital in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse all that has been said about the bill and i fully support the principle of it <e> <s> i have an interest in sutton harbour plymouth <e> <s> reference has been made to the fishermen who sell direct to the factory ships and we suffer them not only in cornwall as has been mentioned but very much so in devon as well <e> <s> we are concerned about the monitoring question <e> <s> we know that already there is evasion <e> <s> if someone has had an extremely good run of catches and gets a chance of a bountiful catch which he can sell by a call to shore and a location with a boat he will sell it <e> <s> it is extraordinarily difficult to prove whether such a person has made a correct return of his catch to the white fish authority in regard to the sums that he was receiving <e> <s> on the other hand inshore fishermen who <e>", "<cs> we are considering a labyrinth of complicated amendments <e> <s> may i say straightaway that i am not in conflict with anybody who has spoken about fair minimum wages but i rise to support my noble friend the minister and i hope that he will adhere to the bill as it has been drafted <e> <s> i want to raise another point which is of great concern for companies who in the main are major companies which certainly adhere to trade union rates but with many firms operating different processes within that complex they find themselves at a considerable disadvantage under the law as it stands <e> <s> this point should be made although i may find myself in conflict with my noble friend lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the fisheries problem would my noble friend bear in mind that we also have a fishing industry down in the south-west and that in particular they are bedevilled by the factory ships <e> <s> i am particularly concerned about the monitoring because it is one thing to make an agreement with the eec countries and to hope that they will as scrupulously monitor the catches as our own people do but it is a very different matter when you have ships from eastern european countries and we have seen rumanian and russian ships and portuguese and egyptian ships buying direct from trawlers so that they do not come through our ports <e> <s> the fish is not landed here where the authorities can check the extent of the catch and also some ships fish on their own account when the shoals go beyond the -mile limit <e> <s> what process is there to see that they too keep to the quotas and that they too do not take advantage of the catches when they come in <e> <s> because this is a very serious problem indeed for the south-west <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware particularly as she raised the point about the educational interest of the report that the standard of training at westminster hospital is reflected in the very high <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also give us an assurance that he will consult the retail trade <e> <s> is he aware that the proposals that have been made make the retailer responsible for defective goods and that <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that if somebody manufactures a product and a retailer markets it it is really unrealistic to expect the retailer to be responsible for it since he does not make it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in congratulating the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for initiating this debate and to say that i found myself very substantially in agreement with all that he said <e> <s> however i would agree with my noble friend lord carrington that his motion is very widely cast and therefore i propose to confine myself to issues of the middle east <e>

parliament to israel <e> <s> we were privileged to meet the prime minister and four other ministers but i do not want to deal with what they then told us because that has been very adequately covered

countries are fitted with the most sophisticated detection equipment which not only can detect missiles submarines or mines but are so advanced and sophisticated that they can differentiate between

you take them back you are referred to the manufacturer <e> <s> the gas hoard does not take responsibility for the making of that appliance <e> <s> they do take responsibility for their supply their connections the gas pipes and the like but where appliances are concerned that is in exactly the same way as with electrical appliances the responsibility of the manufacturer <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord renton for not being here for the opening but i fully support his bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord swansea went into the detail of the matter and indeed the bill appears to refer to what look like replicas which i assume means things that could easily be mistaken for real weapons <e> <s> i had the privilege when in new york of being taken through one of the most difficult precincts <e> <s> i was present when a gang were pulled in <e> <s> they were stripped of their weapons and i was permitted to examine them <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend clarify the position that when a patient is referred by his doctor for the attention of a hospital he is legally entitled to that service under the health service <e> <s> further can he confirm that those picketing outside have no right to cross-question and intimidate patients as to what their private and personal medical record is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as of last wednesday there were six such spanish boats fishing within our waters in the south-west area <e> <s> is he really saying that any foreign company of trawlers can so register with a company in this country and by employing only one british seaman although i understand that the most employed by any of these six spanish trawlers was two british seamen make it possible to evade the regulations and obviously not carry out the letter of our registration <e> <s> if this is to be the case and any of our competitors abroad can by this manoeuvre invade our inshore waters does it not make a nonsense of the present negotiations which we are now having on a common european fishing policy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apply myself to the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord colville of culross which i feel i must oppose <e> <s> on the face of it his amendment seeks to permit the reasonable and legitimate use of film for promotion or training or genuine leisure facilities with which we all firmly agree <e> <s> but the traffic in pornographic films often in unlicensed and sleazy premises and

without a fight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friends lord mottistone and lord campbell of alloway in their amendment <e> <s> it is perhaps apposite if i draw attention to a question which would have been oral had we sat tomorrow morning and which i put on the order paper last week for that purpose but because we are not going to sit tomorrow i had to turn it into a written question <e> <s> with your lordships permission i think it is apposite that i should remind the house of the question and give the reply that the government have made <e> <s> it is very

participate quite often <e> <s> this country is always depicted as the monster <e> <s> i get a little tired when i realise that there is no country in the commonwealth which has been more generous over entry nor more sympathetic than has the united kingdom <e> <s> we should not forget that a very large proportion of the asian population now in our midst are here simply and solely because their african brothers threw them out <e> <s> we should not forget that we have made a great humane contribution to problems not of our making <e> <s> we too often give the idea which is so quickly taken up by our enemies abroad that we have inhumane governments whether they be of the present party or of others <e> <s> we over-exaggerate our self-condemnation from time to time and forget the good which respective governments of both political parties have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have got to draw the line somewhere because throughout the world the husband or in some cases the father still chooses the bride <e> <s> whether it is from a latin mediterranean country or from an asian or african one the girl has not the same dominance that an independent anglo-saxon girl in this country has in making her own decision <e> <s> i think it would widen the abuse <e> <s> i think that the government have gone as far as it is reasonable to ask them to go at this moment of time <e>

issue <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany knows i have been associated with several charities in my time <e> <s> many of them quite specifically raise funds in order to help people in

made up by the charity money which is nationally raised <e> <s> i see a danger <e> <s> if we are to say that there is a level at which a person is to be subsidised regardless of what he earns any astute board of a charity will say you apply for the subsidy and we will charge you the full economic rate and not give you the rate we would have done in accord and in concert with the income you now have <e> <s> it would cut across quite a number of charities who specifically raise money to subsidise people who cannot pay the economic rate <e> <s> if they know that it will be made up by the government and if we put the level at such a height that it is worth charging them the full economic rate then quite a lot of contributions to the charity will not be applied for the purpose for which they were raised <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend not agree that we would create anomalies if we were to ignore what are in many cases very substantial assets <e> <s> it has long been an aim of many professional people to ensure that if their wife outlives them she will have a good roof over her head <e> <s> if we ignore someone who has a very fine house which he will never live in again if we ignore that asset which may be worth a few thousand pounds or a very considerable sum then we have an anomaly <e> <s> on the other hand there may be someone who apart from the old-age pension has a very modest private pension say a british rail pension <e> <s> that railway pension will be taken into account in assessing their ability to pay and it may only be or a week <e> <s> however if we ignore assets a woman whose house is worth or will not be assessed <e> <s> although i accept what the noble baroness said that we could perhaps do with greater definition as to the level at which assessment of assets starts i think we should recognise that if we wipe out these hard tangible assets we shall create many anomalies that will be unfair to people who perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us how many of those issues were in fact for the purposes of defending our foreign visitors such as his holiness the pope president reagan and the many distinguished people and crown heads who visited this country during the wedding <e> <s> to get this matter into perspective we should realise that the figures for the issue of firearms involved in carrying out our duty to them and to many of the foreign embassies which ask for our protection would substantially reduce the figures in peoples minds as to how many officers were issued with firearms for other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl lord kinnoull for having introduced this debate in so timely a fashion <e> <s> it has given many of us who have a close interest in the fishing industry an opportunity to bring its many problems before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords that would have been in the third one and i have not got that far <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs on her initiative in introducing this debate and on the advocacy she has presented <e> <s> i support absolutely fully her intention to eliminate the danger to health from lead pollution <e> <s> where i disagree is that i believe that a substantial and expensive campaign is being launched on the wrong targets <e> <s> as the noble

elderly <e> <s> it is not the same thing at all <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether this inquiry will study very closely the enormous increase in the administrative staff because we hear so many speeches about how much better it was in the past than now which i for one do not accept <e> <s> but nevertheless there has been a monumental increase in administration and what we are really interested in is seeing that the people who <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being here for the start of this debate but from the five speeches i have heard it seems that the sympathy of this house from all sides is very largely for those who want free transport when they are genuinely seeking jobs <e> <s> i am sure that the vast majority of your lordships would support that <e> <s> but as i read this bill unless the lawyers can tell me that i am completely wrong it will mean creating virtually a universal pass enabling people to go anywhere at any time provided that they are unemployed and will put the bill at the door of british rail or her majestys government who will probably have to pay the subsidy <e> <s> are we really to find that if people want to go from glasgow to wembley for the cup final we are going to pay their fares <e>", "<cs> are we going to find that we pay because somebody in middlesbrough

was living in middlesbrough and had an opportunity of a job in london i would rather support him having the right to a free fare to london to be interviewed for that job than the freedom to go anywhere <e> <s> the division between us is not that the unemployed should not be given every opportunity to seek work anywhere in the country with a free voucher but i do think we are laying ourselves wide open to abuse when it is suggested that even confined to the area the noble lord has corrected me and i apologise for my error the concession should include other purposes <e> <s> that still lays us open to abuse <e> <s> let them have a wider area provided they are job seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not surprise your lordships how warmly i welcome this bill <e> <s> indeed i can certainly assure your lordships house how well this bill has been received by the inshore fishermen and the leaders of the trawlermens protection society in sutton harbour and i am given to understand by the protection societies in other ports <e> <s> i have been informed that there was a bbc programme in which the point of view put forward by the noble lord lord john-mackie had a very fair run <e> <s> what i find deplorable is that the secretary of the joint trawlermens protection societies for the south <e>", "<cs> i should like to agree with everything that my noble friend lord campbell of croy has said and assure him that we have fishermen available in the south-west who would be very happy to take out some of their laid-up trawlers <e> <s> on the face of it this amendment appears to be one of tolerant reason but on the basis of information which quite honestly has poured in to me over the weekend from milford haven and from very distinguished members of the eec fisheries committee including mr battersley who has recently come back from spain where he was discussing fishing in advance of the spaniards coming into the common market so i think we can take it that my information is up to date i believe that this three months delay is one of the most ingenious proposals that has been deployed for the spanish ships in this whole exercise <e>", "<cs> if the
