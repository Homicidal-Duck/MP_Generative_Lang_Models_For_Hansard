["<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has been very kind to me and has said that he does not want to upset me but i can assure him that i am quite used to an intellectually rigorous argument and i really think i can take it <e> <s> but before he goes on with his string of criticisms the noble lord might remember that when his government was in office they had no mandate whatever for the cuts made by the international monetary fund and if he is going to speak about young couples and housing he might remind himself that it is his party which is entirely responsible for the demise of the private rented sector which has made it so difficult for young couples to find anywhere to live <e>"]
