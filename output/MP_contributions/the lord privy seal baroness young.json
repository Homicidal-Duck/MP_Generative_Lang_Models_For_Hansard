["<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would be good enough to bring his question to a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> however i wonder if he would be good enough to ask a question because a number of noble lords want to get in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we can have two noble lords from the opposition on their feet at the same time <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney was first <e> <s> perhaps we can then hear from my noble friend and then from the noble lord lord davies of leek <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to ask a question and not make a short statement about a former speech of his <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord molloy please put a question correctly and not make a short speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> on thursday th may my noble friend the chief whip explained to the house that it was the governments intention following requests during the first day in committee on the local government finance no <e> <s> bill that the bill should be recommitted in respect of clause <e> <s> when my noble friend made this announcement last week it was not clear whether the recommitment stage would be taken on the same day as the completion of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords inflation is now in single figures per cent <e> <s> compared with a peak of nearly per cent <e> <s> in may and the prospect is for further reductions <e> <s> we forecast at the time of the budget that the year-on-year rate of inflation would be down to per cent <e> <s> by the end of the year and to per cent <e> <s> by the second quarter of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the usual channels have agreed that the noble lady lady kinloss should speak before we take the statement <e> <s> therefore i think it would be right for the noble lady now to make her speech <e> <s> if it is the wish of the house the statement will be taken immediately afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already spent minutes on three questions and i think really we ought not to take more than three further supplementary questions <e> <s> i suggest that we take supplementaries from the noble lord lord winstanley from my noble friend lord balfour and my noble friend lady macleod <e> <s> then i suggest that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had nine minutes on this question and there is other business to take today <e> <s> i think we have covered this very fully <e> <s> i do not in any way wish to stop noble lords asking questions but i think it really would be the wish of the house that we might now move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords before i repeat the statement i think that it might be helpful to some members of the house if i say on behalf of the chairman of committees that in view of the statement it is proposed that the meeting of the offices committee which was to have taken place at four oclock should now take place immediately after the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the press release is the responsibility of the select committee <e> <s> the practice of both houses is clearly stated in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained in my reply to my noble friend yesterday minority reports are contrary to the practice of either house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would like to say a very brief word on behalf of the house about the very happy news which we heard last night and which the nation has been celebrating this morning <e> <s> the whole house will have a proper opportunity in a few days time to express its congratulations to her majesty the queen when as leader of the house i shall move a motion for an humble address <e> <s> but i am sure that the whole house will wish to join me today in congratulating their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales and in sending the young prince our very warmest wishes for a long and happy life <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign affairs on the visit which he paid to luxembourg on th to st june during which he attended a meeting of the foreign ministers of the ten and the first part of the foreign affairs council which continues today and on which there will be a report to the house <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that an humble address be presented to her majesty in the terms set out on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady hylton-foster has been trying to get in for some time <e> <s> i suggest that she should ask her question and that then we should move on to the last question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is the wish of the house that we should now move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it will meet the wish of the whole house if the noble lord lord jenkins of putney will ask a question and ask it briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had nearly nine minutes on this question and may i suggest that we take the noble lord lord stewart who has been trying to get in for some time and then move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords in the white paper the government announced changes based on looking at types of forms which mean million fewer forms and leaflets for the public and businesses each year <e> <s> departments are now working on arrangements for improving the control and design of all forms <e> <s> i expect that we shall be able to drop some and we intend to make those which cannot be dropped easier and quicker to complete <e> <s> that will save business time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had nine minutes on this question <e> <s> i think that it is right that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury has been trying to get in and has twice given up his place to other peers <e> <s> may i suggest that he asks his question and

achievement by individual county councils has varied but in general there has been significant progress in this important field <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that this is a matter of great interest to the house but i think your lordships would recognise that we have now spent nine minutes on this question <e> <s> therefore i think that we should move on to the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had five minutes on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that there should have been any misunderstanding with the noble lord lord brockway but the next question has now been called and i think it would be right to move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is referring to an analysis undertaken by the central policy review staff of ways in which it might be possible if the government so decided to limit the growth of public expenditure in the longer term <e> <s> this was a confidential analysis prepared for ministers and will not be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the whole house realises that the noble lord lord davies of leek feels strongly about this matter <e> <s> could he just frame his question and ask it briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords might i suggest to the house that we take the noble lord lord alexander and after that move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion proposed so well by the noble lord lord peart and spoken to with his usual eloquence by the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> i have now been leader of your lordships house for just over a year not i have to admit a year of constant peace and tranquillity but at least i have come to learn that the task of congratulating the mover and seconder of the loyal address is one of the most pleasant in our parliamentary

of the address for their excellent speeches <e> <s> today i rise to make my own speech on the humble address and the subject of todays debate is of course home and social affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e> <s> i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords there is everything to be said for introducing school pupils to political facts and values at appropriate stages in their education and in a fair and balanced way <e> <s> what is more doubtful is whether activities described as peace studies should take priority over the many other claims on curriculum time <e> <s> in any event what the school offers should always be education not indoctrination <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now had nine minutes on the first question <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that we take one more very short supplementary question and then move on <e>", "<cs> my lords th noble baroness lady hylton-foster has risen to speak several times <e> <s> perhaps we should take her question next and then i would suggest to the house we might move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we could argue about this for some very considerable time <e> <s> may i suggest that we have the question from the noble baroness lady fisher who has been trying to get in for some time and then i think we should move on <e> <s> it is open to any noble lord to put down another question on this subject for another day <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long run around this question <e> <s> of course i have listened with great care to all the points that have been raised <e> <s> before the question i took advice as to what is the correct procedure in this

what would be the correct way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime minister announced the initiative after close consultation between the secretaries of state for education and science and employment and the chairman of the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords on all matters relating to the length of time that a particular question runs on i try always to act as the voice of the house and suggest that we move on after a given period of time <e> <s> this has in fact happened on quite a number of occasions recently <e> <s> but i am quite sure that the whole house will have taken note of the point which the noble lord lord alport makes about the length of time which is spent on particular questions <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the powers of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science relate to specific courses of teacher training and not to whole institutions as such or to parts of them <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are in fact to debate
