["<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn i should like to add further to the catalogue of important bodies that are appointed by the crown <e> <s> the royal commissions on ancient monuments in the three countries england scotland and wales on the advice of various secretaries of state should not be forgotten <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend the duke of grafton i should also like to declare a very strong interest in this subject being at present the president of the national trust for scotland and also having been involved with both national trusts for something like years which if i have it right is rather longer than the existence of the national land fund itself <e> <s> this is apart from some family interests of my own in the heritage <e> <s> the two national trusts are united in not only their welcome to this bill but in the various improvements that they are trying to bring about in it <e> <s> i am deeply sorry that i was unable to be present to hear the speech on second reading of the chairman of the national trust the noble lord lord gibson which read very well in <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton there is some misunderstanding here both on his part and on that of his advisers <e> <s> if we are told it is not likely to be very useful to acquire rights round about rights which are at present in no legal way associated with the land the trustees are going to acquire how does he get past the fact that the national trust holds many thousands of acres and all those miles of coastline in cornwall and elsewhere as well as the three cases i have quoted in scotland and incidentally the wildfowl refuge on the dee that i mentioned <e> <s> it is only necessary to acquire or get an understanding about one other property with shooting rights it is quite enough in the context <e> <s> it is by no means necessary to get other people in a ring all round <e> <s> geography is not like that at least not in scotland <e>", "<cs> in view of my noble friends sympathetic answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lady withdraws the <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to be allowed to discuss the four amendments nos <e> <s> and because they are all bound together <e> <s> the noble lord lord reigate has said that the phrase trust the trustees was becoming a clich but it cannot be said too often <e> <s> we shall surely see very responsible people appointed to this job so why cannot they be left to improve their procedures and to get on with their responsible job <e> <s> as has been promised by the government on numerous occasions <e> <s> can we not leave the timing and the tactics to the trustees <e>", "<cs> i think i understand what the noble lord is saying but could he make it a little clearer that the promise apparently given at second-hand in the other place and it is difficult to say that without discourtesy that the museum interests would be able to block what the land and buildings heritage interest wants is really not so <e> <s> and that the review that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i think we have probably said enough <e> <s> on that understanding and seeing the point has been made that land and buildings could be taken out of part ii by leaving movables in part ii if that is so i am happy to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in a very brief few words support what the other two noble lords have said <e> <s> they have made an excellent case and i hope very much that the noble lord who is in charge of the bill will be able to yield on this and accept either one amendment or the other <e> <s> there is perhaps one additional point in that the scope of these trustees will cover four different parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> a unifying factor for appointment therefore would be found if the prime minister or the crown were to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word before the amendment is put <e> <s> it does of course as the noble lord has made clear go together with all the others up to no <e> <s> inclusive <e> <s> this is an entirely satisfactory answer to the points which we were urging at committee stage which particularly arose out of the experience over many years of the national trust and the national trust for scotland <e> <s> i think the conclusion if all these amendments are passed is entirely satisfactory and i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the various noble lords who have spoken in support of my amendment <e> <s> but in view of the attitude of the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton it is probably useless for me to take the matter further <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw my first amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a reasonable amendment and deserving of support <e> <s> although it is right that the forestry commission land should be sold off with greater freedom than in the past i think we are all worried at the extreme open-endedness of clause <e> <s> it is not reasonable in this very long-term situation which is the intrinsic character of forestry to rely on the statements of ministers mortal ministers however sincere they may be <e> <s> if parliament intends some limitation of this nature it should say so <e> <s> i see no reason why my noble friend lord mansfield should not accept this amendment <e> <s> i sincerely hope that he will do so <e> <s> reading the report of the second reading debate i notice that the noble baroness lady jeger said that the nations forest estate as a whole should be made inalienable like the national trust estates <e> <s> especially and above all i think this might apply to the ancient royal forests that remain and we have heard much mention of the forest of dean and the new forest <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides whether to press or to withdraw the <e>", "<cs> i am sure that that is correct that the whole matter of this unfortunate contradiction of the law does not apply to the national trust of scotland <e> <s> therefore i suppose that it is not in order to bring up the matter of the amendment that was not moved at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would most earnestly beg my noble friend lord mansfield to accept this amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> of course it stands not only in that noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is not going to reply immediately to the noble lord lord ross of marnock i should like to back him up by thanking him most sincerely for the eloquent way in which he has stated the case for both national trusts <e> <s> the inalienability to which the noble lord opposite has referred is a vital characteristic of both national trusts <e> <s> it is the vital principle on which they both work and on which is founded the confidence of their supporting public <e> <s> inalienability means that once the council of the national trust has declared land to be inalienable that land can never thereafter be compulsorily acquired without the consent of parliament itself <e> <s> the procedure is in part iii of schedule to the acquisition of land authorisation procedure scotland act <e>", "<cs> was our confidence misplaced <e> <s> our confidence has been badly shaken by the proposed all-embracing powers of disposal which are to be given to ministers by the few brief words in lines and on page of this bill <e> <s> the same applies in respect of the national trust in england and wales where the method of handing over land to the forestry commission customarily and for the same general reasons and with the same confidence has been by leasing <e> <s> owing to differences in english law this has been done by a different method and in most cases ownership in common speech remains with the trust <e> <s> we believe as a matter of principle that as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said only something in the act itself will be sufficiently good enough to allay our very real fears <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave i should like to make a few remarks about the implications which have been suggested by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i certainly have no accusation against the noble earl lord mansfield for discourtesy or anything like that <e> <s> indeed if he tried to get me at the dentist yesterday afternoon i would not have been in a position to say anything so it is just as well that he did not do so <e> <s> however honestly it has been a <e>", "<cs> never <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord ross of marnock the compulsory purchase power which now exists refers only to land for the forestry commission and then only to england and wales therefore both the compulsory purchase for another purpose of land in scotland was nothing to do with the provision which is now in effect being repealed <e>"]
