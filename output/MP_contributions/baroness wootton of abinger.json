local authorities <e> <s> it ran all through our education system primary schools had teachers while secondary schools had schoolmistresses and schoolmasters <e> <s> the whole of the educational system is tainted with this particular language and with these changes in organisation <e> <s> i very much hope that the committee will recommend that these distinctions are irrelevant to the climate of today and should be removed <e>", "<cs> on the question of enforceability may i assure the noble lord that it is common to have expressions of this kind in the qualifications expected for all sorts of boards and institutions governmentally appointed persons experienced in industry in commerce the professions or such like <e>", "<cs> it is clear that a large number of noble lords on both sides of the committee have some sympathy with the objectives of the amendment <e> <s> many of us have tried to say what good it would do <e> <s> may i ask the minister to say what harm it would do <e>", "<cs> might i ask the noble ministers who i know are loaded with questions to remember my simple question <e> <s> what harm would it do if this amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has

whether the primary school articles go to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like cordially to support my noble friend in this amendment and to endorse the grounds on which he has introduced it that it does bring knowledge of the outside world under consideration when governors are appointed <e> <s> the only thing that troubles me a little is the phrase where appropriate of community relations <e> <s> community relations has conic to have a rather specialised meaning in this country <e> <s> i should have thought that community relations as those words normally are understood in english meant relations between all members of the community <e> <s> but it has come to have this particular meaning of racial relations and therefore the words where appropriate are put in front of it because it would not perhaps he particularly appropriate to put somebody with specialised knowledge of <e>", "<cs> this is clearly a gamble <e> <s> if the government succeed in reducing the rate of inflation as they hope let us suppose that they succeed in reducing it considerably so that prices become almost stable which older members of the house will remember as a possibility <e> <s> if prices become stable pensions will remain the same in money terms <e> <s> pensioners tend to think in terms of money although they realise that their money is being eroded by the rising cost of living <e> <s> if pensions are fixed only in relation to prices and the government succeed in their policies a great deal better than we on the opposition benches expect pensioners will he receiving lower increases <e> <s> if on the other hand the government face complete disaster in their anti-inflation policies prices will roar ahead and pensioners possibly will believe that they have got more real income <e> <s> they will find more money in their pockets and probably will prefer that than to have a figure of pension that is stabilised because prices themselves are stabilised <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers reply mean that such institutions as hillcroft college or fircroft not to mention ruskin college are safe from closure <e> <s> is there any real distinction between colleges as my noble friend has suggested which are under local authority control and those which are national institutions in that they all draw in a very wide population and they all produce people who have missed out on earlier opportunities for education and who afterwards give extremely valuable service to the community <e>", "<cs> i should like very warmly to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> the experience of most of us is that the one outstanding characteristic of emergencies is that they are not predictable and it is on that ground that i should like warmly to support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> in the nature of the case we have not seen the regulations <e> <s> we cannot at this stage <e> <s> we do not know how comprehensive they may be <e> <s> surely the logical procedure as the noble lord opposite suggested is to cover in the regulations all the things which experience shows are likely to happen and to put into the bill itself <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble baronesss explanation and she is very persuasive but surely there is a new situation and is there not a gap <e> <s> there is the advisory committee there is the chief benefits officer and there are the rules <e> <s> the rules are not rules which are made for ever and it will be somebodys business to say how the rules are working out <e> <s> surely that is the thing upon which the chief benefits officer would feel obliged to report <e> <s> they may well work out in all sorts of ways which are unexpected <e> <s> there may be very heavy demands under one head and very little demand under another head

the rules ought to be altered <e> <s> is there not a gap there which ought to be filled <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt for one moment the advisory committee will surely advise the minister about new rules will it not <e> <s> otherwise what else will it do <e> <s> does it not give advice on the rules <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will forgive me for interrupting again he has more access to data than anybody else <e>", "<cs> who will publish <e>", "<cs> i do not ask the noble baroness to do any more at the moment but would she <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the acceptability of stock to the public very largely depends on the terms and that the terms carry implications because of the very high rates of interest that they now carry about what the value of that interest will be in the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords why then do the public buy them <e>", "<cs> my lords while associating myself with all that has been said by way of sympathy and admiration i should like to ask one question in further clarification of the legal point raised by the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> i understand that one gunman is under arrest and is not in hospital <e> <s> did i understand the noble lord lord belstead to imply that that gunman is liable to he prosecuted for any offence which would be open for prosecution had it been committed by a british national in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords surely everything that the noble baroness has said relating to earnings applies equally to prices and that at the time when pensions are up-rated they are up-rated on a guess as to what the level of prices will be in november about six months later <e> <s> if this is an obstacle to keeping pensions level with earnings it is equally an obstacle to keeping pensions level with prices which i understand is the intention of the government <e> <s> it seems to me that her argument is exactly the same in both cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to ask the question asked by the noble lord lord campbell of croy but i wanted to put in addition the question whether it is not a fact that this process is utilised on quite a considerable scale in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords will the right reverend prelate give way <e> <s> on the first occasion my bill passed second reading and was through committee without amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have never met personally mr berry or mrs ward but when i was about to introduce my bill in the previous parliament i received a communication from their solicitor indicating that they were contemplating promoting a personal bill <e> <s> but having heard that i was about to introduce a ill giving wider relaxation of the present marriage laws they decided to wait to see what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the house that under standing orders a debate on a statement may not take place unless the house has so resolved <e> <s> i am not aware that any such resolution has been put <e>", "<cs> i should like to support in the strongest possible terms the amendment which my noble friend has just moved <e> <s> what makes the bill more disgraceful is not only that it takes away the real value from one of the more pecuniarily handicapped sections of the population but that this follows on a budget a year ago which gave very substantial sums more than enough to cover what is involved here to persons in the upper brackets of the income tax scale <e> <s> a sum of million was given back in income tax to persons with incomes over a year nearly million of it to persons with incomes of over a year <e> <s> we will say for the government that having done that last year they did have second thoughts this year and they have not repeated that exercise <e> <s> but they have done the reverse <e> <s> they have now taken to recouping their depleted exchequer at the expense of the unemployed the sick and the disabled <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness give way for one moment <e> <s> if you do not pay your taxes you are charged interest if the government cannot get your taxes ready in time for you to pay them they put them on a year early <e>", "<cs> will

<s> in the mean <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord sandys has given us a very stimulating intellectual discourse which contained two points on which i should like to comment <e> <s> the first was his elaborate explanation that there is no real actuarial basis for the benefits that people now receive under the national insurance act <e> <s> whatever else may be said from this side i should like to say that i am entirely in agreement with the noble lord and this has been true for a long time <e> <s> the argument that what people are paid governs what they receive is with great respect to my noble friend lord wells-pestell now out of date because that relationship has long since been destroyed <e> <s> that is a simple matter which we can appreciate <e> <s> people now receive what parliament decides they shall receive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it may well be that school buses have been operated safely for a long time and i do not doubt that their drivers are very careful <e> <s> but there has only to be one serious accident and then it will appear that the public authorities have allowed the drivers of school buses to put children at risk by requiring lower qualifications for their drivers than they do for the general public that they are risking the lives of children in a way that they would not risk the lives of the general public <e> <s> that is how it will appear if there should be a serious accident and one day who knows <e> <s> however long and well they may have driven in the past that risk

the west end where my court dealt with west end shoplifting cautioning was exceptional except in the case of juveniles <e> <s> is the noble lord able to say whether those figures included juveniles or were they for adults only <e>", "<cs> my lords although i think it is important that there should be someone on the commission who has this kind of practical experience i should like to point out that most of the complaints that one is disposed to make against the bbc and other broadcasting organisations are just the matters that the noble lord lord winstanley has mentioned <e> <s> they concern the way in which interviews are cut and the way in which one is misrepresented <e> <s> if there is too high a proportion of professional broadcasting producers and such persons on the commission they will come strongly prejudiced on one side <e> <s> of that there is no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point raised by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case how is it so easy for my noble friend to

my lords is it not a fact that it does not make any difference what the future is going to be <e> <s> the electricity council have admitted that they made a mistake in the past and they have enjoyed the interest on the money they owed to their consumers for six months at least so it must be quite a substantial sum <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give us an assurance that the suggestion which has appeared in the press that the axe might fall on some of the consumer councils attached to nationalised industries will not take effect and that these will be safeguarded <e> <s> they are a most valuable safeguard for the consumer <e> <s> would he not agree that the consumer has very few opportunities of making his needs felt without organisations of such a kind <e>", "<cs> my lords if

government would support steps in certain directions <e> <s> i am asking why if they are willing to support steps taken they do not themselves take them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not appreciate and if he does will he call the attention of british rail to it the disappointment that is caused by the information that most of the improvements have already been implemented <e> <s> that is in a situation in which on one particular line corridor trains are regularly run with the access from one coach to another permanently blocked with the lavatories all permanently locked and where the trains stop at a station which is being rebuilt and has no lavatory <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i have to leave the debate in a few moments <e> <s> however before doing so i should like to make a short speech of about two sentences <e> <s> the law is often said to be an ass but i do not think that it could be a greater ass than if it decreed that a document which had been

be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill as many of your lordships are aware has had a somehat chequered history <e> <s> it was first before this house for a second reading just two years ago in

father may be tempted to make a liaison with her <e> <s> there is nothing in saying that marriage at the end is possible that increases the temptation <e> <s> in fact as i pointed out in some respects it diminishes the temptation <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not make it legally possible what the noble lord called this kind of abuse is legally possible at present <e> <s> perhaps it ought not to be but it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for his very kind and co-operative speech and should the bill be given a second reading this evening i shall indeed be very grateful if i have an opportunity to co-operate with him in drafting amendments that may be desirable to make it more effective and more precise <e> <s> i find it exceptionally difficult to reply to the debate because as far as i can see for the most part there has been no meeting of minds on the main issues except in regard to certain things which i shall mention in a moment <e> <s> there has been no meeting of minds in the sense that practically no attention has been paid to most of the positive arguments that i have put forward in support of my bill <e> <s> these were ignored <e> <s> there was for instance the fact that the prohibitions of the present degree of intensity are not widely scattered through other countries that have more or less a common culture with ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misheard the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords are the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much interested in the statistics which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor quoted showing a reduction in the crime days spent by high court judges <e> <s> i take it that this cannot be due to any diminution of criminality but does it mean that the rest of the community is becoming more litigious in civil cases <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why in addition to overlooking the advice they have received in the numerous reports referred to by the select committee they are also cutting themselves off from future supplies of advice as for instance by not reactivating the advisory council on the penal system <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness make it perfectly clear i think it was inherent in her previous answer that someone can live in a house worth unmortgaged and receive supplementary benefit and secondly if someone receives let us say redundancy pay of up to he can be restrained from spending that as income <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the present situation gives great incitement to people to spend their redundancy pay at one go as it were in order that they may qualify for supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chairman of the national parks commission and

myself with my noble friend lord gifford <e> <s> i should have thought that the law of attempts was quite sufficient to deal with attempts to steal motor-cars to steal property from motor-cars and to drive motor-cars away just as much as it is available to deal with crimes of attempts to steal or to murder <e> <s> for that reason it seems to me that we are still picking out a particular class of action and a particular kind of object to which these provisions are to attach <e> <s> this is quite unreasonable <e> <s> we should allow it to be covered by the general law of attempt <e>", "<cs> my

now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister explain what is the ground for this governments resolute opposition to arbitration in this case the more so inasmuch as the arrangements which were made under the priestley commission are now considered to be out of date <e> <s> why are the government not willing to allow this dispute to be sent to arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether the countryside commission has expressed any public view on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is perfectly simple and clear and apparently expresses a principle with which the noble baroness is in agreement <e> <s> she has given the house some tremendously complicated figures which at short notice it is very difficult to follow and which seem to produce a result which is contrary to that contained in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that at the time of the th century legislation to which my noble friend lord mishcon referred members of parliament were not paid <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend would make it clear whether in the case where a person has been convicted and is in prison pending an appeal he would or would not under my noble friends amendments be drawing his parliamentary salary <e> <s> if he is detained in prison pending appeal obviously he could not attend this house but would he retain his parliamentary salary pending appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government discourage the practice which is now so common of justifying increases in price by saying that they are necessary in order to keep up with the rate of inflation as though the rate of inflation was a natural phenomenon or an act of god or of the devil <e> <s> there is no more certain way of maintaining inflation than by using the pretext for raising prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes think that on all sides of the house we are in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness have in mind that a great number of persons

satisfactorily supported or his case satisfactorily put to the ombudsman by his own member of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl explain what would be the position if a child was not residing with his parents in a particular area possibly because he was not getting on well with his parents and had gone to live with an aunt in another area <e> <s> to which area does that child

too long to read in full and a portion obviously having been selected when the final conclusion was that the secretary of state did act unlawfully <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order may i ask

place here and now and that is entirely contrary to standing orders <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government are strongly in favour of free collective bargaining and that this appears to be the result of free collective bargaining <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment to ask the noble lord whether after all these changes it is reasonable to describe this as an insurance fund in the normal meaning of that term <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he could now answer my question <e> <s> an insurance as it is commonly understood means that the insured pay certain premiums in exchange for which in certain contingencies they have the right to certain benefits <e> <s> is this now still an insurance scheme <e>", "<cs>

provision for educating those who legislate and organising some courses probably at primary school level for members of this house and another place so that we do not constantly have a sense of inferiority in the presence of our children and grandchildren <e> <s> and we might be better equipped does he not think to conduct the business that we are supposed to be competent to do <e>", "<cs>

anomaly which arises <e> <s> in present circumstances this affects the poorest people of all those living on supplementary benefit <e> <s> if a man and woman are living in the same home and officers

supplementary benefit in her own right <e> <s> she is deprived of that right and becomes a dependant of the man <e> <s> in that case the law giving her a reputed marriage works against her but in this case it is proposed that it should work to her advantage <e> <s> it seems anomalous that we should have the two different attitudes <e> <s> it makes one feel more sympathy with the new arrangement proposed in the amendment <e> <s> it would take care of the cases where the woman suffered from as it were being left out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer and i wonder whether he will allow me to ask him two further questions <e> <s> is he really satisfied regarding the deprivation that is now suffered by senior academic personnel who at the beginning of the war were preparing for academic posts threw up everything to join the forces served throughout the war and often suffered delayed demobilisation with the result that they could not comply with the requirement that they should obtain a new academic post by june <e> <s> secondly is he aware of the extraordinary anomalies that are arising under the administration of the present rules <e> <s> for instance when a conscientious objector registered he was directed to alternative service and received full credit for his years in that service while a senior professor who was a fellow of the royal society served for four years as a volunteer in the navy and through being four months too late in obtaining an academic appointment received nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am merely asking whether the minister is aware of this <e> <s> this is the last example that i should like the minister to note <e> <s> is the minister aware that the case to which i have just referred is contrasted with the case of someone in this country who was in university employment was drafted to the ministry of supply to do research on armaments and receives no credit at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he would look into similar provisions that are made in a number of friendly countries in the eec which i think he will find are a great deal more liberal <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the teenager training scheme included in the noble earls question <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that one of the last acts of the advisory council on the penal system was to make a number of recommendations that would materially have shortened prison sentences and that one of the first acts of this government was to abolish that council <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is not able to comment on the report which was published only a few weeks ago and is equally unable to make use of the report which was published three years ago would he say what period of delay is natural before any action is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a few questions for the noble earl about the administration of this scheme but i think they can now wait until it is in operation <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations on the lucid and helpful way in which the noble earl has explained what is after all quite a complex scheme <e> <s> i should like to confirm the hope that we may have reciprocity <e> <s> i was once surprised to find in the peking university library a book of my own <e> <s> i trust that we shall have negotiations with the republic of china as well as with those near at home <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord the minister agree that the sheer complication of this matter is a condemnation of the whole thing <e> <s> would it not be possible for the government to bring forward amendments which would make the situation intelligible not merely to the members of your lordships committee but also to the unfortunate people who have to work out what they are going to get in benefits <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that makes no difference <e> <s> the fault might lie with the act but there might now be an opportunity to make some simplifications which would be intelligible wherever the fault has arisen in the first instance <e>", "<cs> can i not appeal again to the minister if he is going to take this back and think up something on the lines of an answer to a written question at the same time to think of some method by which we could simplify this whole matter so that people could understand it <e> <s> if the law is being reformed can it not be reformed in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for his reassurance might i ask him whether there is not a danger that some of these weapons which may be lethal will eventually find their way into the hands of persons who want to use them for criminal purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that there is sufficient protection after sale and that the conditions of sale are sufficiently strict <e> <s> even if there is no serious danger of accidents during the use of the weapons for the purpose for which they are issued would the noble lord confirm that there is strict supervision of the persons who may purchase them eventually <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lords figure of a week a compound of male wages and female wages an average of the two or does it refer solely to male wages <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the minister to say that one of the measures this government were taking was to increase the supply of dried milk <e> <s> can he say what use dried milk is in a drought <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister confirm that a course is already running for members of both houses of parliament and is advertised in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount the minister confirm that a course is now running or is just about to be opened for members only at present but members of either house of parliament and that an advertisement is appearing in the <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself very strongly with my noble friends amendment and to emphasise that while it may be possible occasionally in a large central prison like holloway to achieve some sort of segregation of young people in local prisons where so many of them go the conditions are particularly bad worse than they are in central prisons and the overcrowding is intense <e> <s> there is really no possibility of proper segregation <e>", "<cs> one of the things which the bill proposes is to do away with borstal training <e> <s> no doubt the youth custody centres will be largely located in the borstal institutions but it seems likely that the length of sentences and the number of persons so committed will be less than the total man-woman population over time in the borstal centres <e> <s> could not some use be made of the borstal centres to relieve this problem <e> <s> could not some spare accommodation be found in that way <e>", "<cs> the amendment does not say that the people who are already there are to be turned out <e> <s> it just says that further people are not to be put in <e>", "<cs> since the statistics give the reconviction figures for detention centres as a whole it would surely not be necessary to track out every individual but to have a breakdown according to the different types of detention centre those which practise the short sharp shock and those which are less short less sharp and less shocking <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would ease the noble lords problem if he were to finish the quotation which runs <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and i hope that the minister will make clear by what if any means the government will enforce this provision if it remains in the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the principle enunciated by the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> she does not believe in voting for things that are not practical <e> <s> all my life which has been pretty long i have lived on the presumption that politics is not the art of the possible it is the art of making the impossible possible <e> <s> on that basis i have seen an enormous number of reforms which were laughed out of court as utopian when i was young <e>", "<cs> the ministers extremely complicated explanation seemed to have two halves which were in direct conflict with one another <e> <s> all the evidence is that the courts like the two-year order and that they increasingly like making two-year orders <e> <s> occassionally they make three-year orders but as time has gone by it has looked as if they are becoming obsolete <e> <s> the noble lord there makes the extraordinary assumption that if they could not make three-year orders then instead of accelerating two-year orders they would be caused to think of custodial sentences instead <e> <s> there is no evidence whatever for that and it is an unrealistic assumption <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> we are making a mountain out of a molehill a criminal offence a prisonable offence out of a social nuisance <e>", "<cs> my lords am i mistaken in thinking that there is an international convention relating to the production of chemical weapons as distinct from the other kind the neutron weapons <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter concluded his speech by choosing a particular example <e> <s> there is no reference in the amendment to local authorities <e> <s> local authorities do employ persons and they have to pay certain rates of wages but this is an amendment which refers to employers and the typical employer is a business person <e> <s> it is intended and i think rightly intended that business people whether or not they be local authorities should pay the wages which have been negotiated by trade unions for the particular occupations of those whom they employ <e> <s> it is not a device by which local authorities can somehow betray ratepayers by giving preference to people who are members of the labour party as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter apparently implied <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble and learned lord on this amendment <e> <s> we shall gain by pooling these various youth institutions by the greater fluidity and the possibility therefore of placing more people because there are no blockages in the particular types of institutions <e> <s> moreover there are the distinctions between borstal for instance and young prisoner centres <e> <s> originally the borstal institutions were primarily training places whereas the young prisoner centres were for more punitive cases <e> <s> those distinctions have worn out in the course of time and there is now great similarity between all the institutions of all types available to young offenders except the four particular detention centres <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word in support of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> there is no possibility that any two children one of whom has been in care and one of whom has been in remand for an offence would understand the difference <e> <s> those children would both be aware that they have lost their liberty for a certain period <e> <s> it is true that in a restrictive legal construction in care has a different meaning from remand but that is a strictly legal matter <e> <s> no child or its parents will understand it and injustice will be seen to be done <e> <s> it is most improper that injustice should be seen to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the minister would bear in mind another feature of academic education <e> <s> i do not know whether it can be procured by the examination system or not probably not <e> <s> all education in universities and other forms of higher education and further education concentrates on the acquisition of the knowledge skill and ability of the individual <e> <s> they do not do anything whatever to prepare for the fact of life that when he leaves the university or whatever institution he is educated at he goes out into a world where he has to work in the company of other people <e> <s> this seems to me to be entirely overlooked in our whole educational system <e> <s> you try to get a first-class degree for yourself <e>", "<cs> does not the minister feel that there is something in this <e> <s> he tries to get a first-class degree for himself and then goes out and has to mix with people who are perhaps of greatly inferior intelligence <e> <s> could not something be done to give a bigger sense of the communal nature of all kinds of occupation at all levels after leaving the educational system <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the fact that the select committee is confining its inquiries to western europe or to the western world <e> <s> may i suggest that they might have something to learn from japan in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware whether the select committee is making inquiries over a wider area than the western world <e>", "<cs> my lords i have something of a sense of unreality about this debate but my first and most pleasant task is to add my congratulations and welcome to those expressed to the noble lord lord gormley <e> <s> i think that perhaps i should append to that a little warning and that is that we may be extremely self-indulgent in trying to draw upon his remarkable store of wisdom and experience and i hope we shall not try his patience too much <e> <s> i hope we shall hear him very often <e> <s> my less pleasant task is to confess that i cannot stay to the end of this debate <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to criticise my comments i would point out that it is no answer if we are pursuing the wrong policy to say that a lot of other people have been pursuing the same or even worse with similar and in some cases notably worse results <e> <s> in no degree does it lighten the burden that the only thing we can do in this house and in the other place is to change our methods here <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak on this bill but i think that my noble <e>", "<cs> we are all in favour of tidying up of consistency and of avoiding unnecessary complexity <e> <s> it seems to me that there are two criteria here <e> <s> one is the criterion of the cost of the service and the other is the criterion of the persons means <e> <s> in a sense they are related for one would only consider a persons means in relation to the kind of cost that was involved <e> <s> would it not be possible for the noble lord the minister to take this back again and to think of a formula which would bring both criteria into the bill <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with that <e> <s> that is what i am trying to get at <e> <s> the cost of the service is a factor that comes in because a service that is a very small one may be a very burdensome one to a person of very small means while the cost of a service which is much larger may not matter so much to a person of large means <e> <s> would it be possible not to prescribe a specific percentage of the cost of the service as i understand is the present position but simply to say that these two factors would be brought into the picture <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather a strange use of language to call an offer of that kind bogus <e> <s> a bogus offer as i understand it is one which the party making it does not intend to carry out <e> <s> it would be perfectly legitimate to call this an unacceptable offer but i think it is somewhat provocative to introduce the word bogus <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is of very great importance and i hope that every member of this house who is or has been a parent will envisage the situation of the parent <e> <s> suppose that your wife is taken ill and you are left at home with one or two children with whom you cannot cope <e> <s> your first reaction is that you are very glad that there is a local authority place or some kind of place where your child can be in residence during this crisis at home <e> <s> then comes next week and you think you will go and see the child but you find that you are denied access to your own child <e> <s> imagine this and imagine yourself in that situation when you have young children at home <e> <s> your immediate reaction to that would be they have no right to do this and by that you mean that only a court of law can have a right to do it <e> <s> this amendment would make it obligatory that denial of any access to the child should be subject to the approval of a court of law <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister think it rather odd that the government refuse to enter into any discussions with the argentine government on the grounds that we are still in a state of war and that the time is not ripe while at the same time they give them financial freedom by lifting the restrictions upon their borrowing powers <e>", "<cs> will the term frequency relate only to repeated applications for data referring to the same person or might it not be that having obtained data referring to one data subject the inquirer might have his interest stimulated in certain others <e> <s> this might go on for quite a long time quite legitimately he might find that six or seven people were involved in whatever it was that interested him and that as he proceeded from one copy of the data to another he would be quite justified in pursuing his case <e>", "<cs> i would suggest with respect that that does not answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the scope of the question been somewhat improperly enlarged <e> <s> the question was were there any security implications in the appointment of a member of the communist party <e> <s> we are now talking about people who are thought to hold communist views are we not <e> <s> is that not an unjustifiable enlargement <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister explain rather more precisely the distinction which he draws between political propaganda and explaining government policy <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that it is the duty of the government to explain their policy to the people <e> <s> i believe he also said that there is nothing political in doing so <e> <s> can the minister make that distinction clearer <e> <s> surely he would agree that in explaining the governments policy one is explaining the policy of the party which the government represent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble earl answered the question put by the noble lord lord bruce of donington as to whether there would be any overlap during which mr macgregor would be holding both posts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord resumes his seat in order to clarify the position may i ask him one question <e> <s> when he read the sections from the th century acts i think the word unlawfully appeared when any person unlawfully does grievously bodily harm or words to that effect <e> <s> this seems to limit the scope of those sections <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord consider that they ought to improve on the actions of the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that it is legal to obtain a shotgun without signing any conditions about safe-keeping and that a neighbour who owns five shotguns can hang them all on the front door for me to take if i wish <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble baroness is not saying that it is impossible to calculate what the maximum loss might be under the regulations <e> <s> does she not have the advantage of all modern methods of calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness admitting that they made the scheme without that information <e>", "<cs> while i have great sympathy with the purpose of the amendment i think that both the bill as it stands and the amendment are attempting the impossible <e> <s> they are trying to define all the various circumstances in which the partner in a marriage where there is divorce may or may not have adequate income <e> <s> surely the only point at issue is that if in a marriage a woman to take the more probable case has for some time been supported entirely by her husband and then there is a divorce she should have something to live on in future <e> <s> surely all that is needed is as i think the bill at present states that there should be reference to <e>", "<cs> as the debate proceeds it becomes more and more clear that the variety of circumstances that might be relevant to this clause is absolutely endless <e> <s> many of us are impressed with the need in principle for some clause of this kind <e> <s> though i regret that my noble friend tried to particularise i prefer the words of her amendment to the words in the bill <e> <s> many of us may feel that we are voting for the principle of the amendment rather than the words in which she has chosen to express the situations to which it may apply <e>", "<cs> my lords does that not carry the implication that only in the case of elected bodies has the public any right to know what is going on <e> <s> but executive bodies are protected from public investigation <e>", "<cs> i hope that this matter can be dealt with by regulation <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable importance <e> <s> my

are about to disappear so far as the pensioners are concerned <e> <s> secondly is it proposed to take into account the position of persons who may still be in employment with the council at the time it is abolished and who already may have accumulated rights to considerable superannuation when they retire <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for extending if by implication the scope of my question <e> <s> it was obvious to me that as soon as we started on one council it would become a common matter which would necessarily be dealt with in relation to all the councils which would come under a central scheme <e> <s> i hope that that extension will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems rather surprising that the proceeds from this extremely valuable site i do not know how much money it has fetched but it must be a great deal should apparently all be spent on what is virtually a removal job <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand why the noble minister thinks it necessary to make possible searches by ununiformed police with all this elaborate performance of producing documentary evidence and so forth when a perfectly simple way around that is that they should be in uniform <e> <s> this sidetracks all this unnecessary paraphernalia <e> <s> why does he want to enlarge the scope by bringing this in <e>", "<cs> if one lives in an area where coloured people are as a result of

probability of an offence <e> <s> that difficulty will be avoided if we use the term specific circumstances <e> <s> reasonable suspicion alone will not do in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference between a trade unionist and a company shareholder may be very great but are they not both equally entitled to object to their money being used without their consent for purposes of which they disapprove <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble viscount say under what statute or other document that protection applies to company shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware

proposition <e> <s> that is that we should commend the name of the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> to those gentlemen who select the cricketers who defend our skill in that game on foreign soil
