["<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon said that he would try to explain his amendment in laymans language <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure either that he has succeeded in that ambition or that in my reply i shall be able to use only laymans language in order to explain what the clause is about <e> <s> the background at any rate is a perfectly simple one it is that if somebody has deliberately hidden his own wrongdoing or in certain other cases where his action has been such that it would be unconscionable for him to rely on the limitation period to save him from the consequences of his wrongdoing he should not be able to take advantage of the limitation period <e> <s> the noble lord quite rightly says that it is a new clause but the purpose of the clause is to restate the law more or less as it is in language which is more or less contemporary because the old law has come to be interpreted by the courts in such a way that the old language is no longer contemporary and this is thought to be an easier way of putting it <e>", "<cs> again i am delighted in one sense but surprised in another that this suggestion should come from the benches opposite and not from behind me <e> <s> what the noble lord with all the authority of the law society behind him is saying is that i should use a non-contentious law reform bill as a vehicle for making contingency provision against the possibility of future strikes in the public service <e> <s> i am advised that this might make the bill contentious in another place and unless the amendment is absolutely essential it ought not for that reason to be agreed to law reform being by consent or not at all <e> <s> i think this is really the stage at which the politician takes the place in my heart in preference to the lawyer <e> <s> of course if the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones were to assure me that his party were solidly behind the law society and the noble lord lord mishcon then it is conceivable that my heart might soften towards lord mishcon <e> <s> but unless i get such an assurance i am bound to advise the committee that this is not really a good thing to do in the way suggested <e>", "<cs> i see around me on the benches opposite and on the cross-benches many persons who are in many ways better qualified than i to speak but i think it might be appropriate if i disclosed my own position before they seek to do so <e> <s> we had the second reading of this bill before christmas and this clause as now drafted is part of the bill and the bill is a pure matter of consolidation <e> <s> rather late last week the noble lord lord mishcon put down this amendment and i think it does rather more than his brief introduction might lead us to suppose since it is a breach of the principle upon which high court judges are selected <e> <s> incidentally i think without consultation with the other branch of the profession it is very much calculated to create ill-feeling between the two branches of the profession upon whose friendly co-operation the whole smooth working of our system of justice ultimately depends <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to be able to persuade the noble lord that there is nothing sinister in the attitude i am taking <e> <s> perhaps i might begin by reminding your lordships if you do not already know what the <e>", "<cs> i think i can give a qualified welcome to this amendment too <e> <s> our intention is that revocation of legal aid for non-payment of contributions should be used only as a last resort and in flagrant cases <e> <s> it will usually be more convenient to leave the legal aid order standing and enforce the contributions after the case rather than revoke the legal aid and have to deal with the unrepresented defendant in a serious case which is a very obvious consideration <e>", "<cs> this has rather taken me by surprise and perhaps i had better express my surprise before there is any debate <e> <s> i was expecting this to extend to a wider range of topics under this head than in fact the noble lord has chosen quite within his proper rights to place together <e> <s> at first sight the question is simply one of semantics though it may be one of taste and sensitivity as well <e> <s> i do not think it really is that because there is going to be and perhaps we can deal with it as and when these amendments are moved a rather more profound debate underlying it as to which i fancy i take a less sympathetic view than i would take simply on the question of nomenclature <e>", "<cs> again i am not intending the smallest degree of criticism of the way in which the noble lord lord mishcon has chosen to put his amendments to some extent in the order in which they come for which there is normally an overwhelming case but i find myself rather embarrassed in dealing with this amendment because i had hoped that in one way or another we should deal with this sequence of interdependent amendments more or less as a whole <e> <s> with great respect i think one has to make up ones mind what is the philosophy you are trying to introduce into the fatal accidents act when you are trying to introduce any change at all of this kind <e> <s> i entered into this at some length in my second reading speech but in dealing with what is really the question of the unmarried minor child i find myself driven to appeal to the question of philosophy before i deal with the particular case <e>", "<cs> i seem to be getting up all the time but i hope that i may be forgiven <e> <s> i think that this really is the kernel of the question which we have really got to decide <e> <s> the law commission and the pearson commission have both decided that damages for bereavement should consist of an arbitrary sum not the same arbitrary sum <e> <s> the noble lord in invoking the law of scotland to my mind might just as well have involved the law of sweden although i know no more than he does about what it says as regards this because we all know that the law of scotland is in some respects vastly superior to our own and in some respects a miserable reflection of the worst features of english law <e> <s> but to my mind this is the heart of the matter <e> <s> let us suppose that a man loses his wife <e> <s> in my case thank god <e> <s> no one was to blame so i would not get anything under this bill and i did not want to get anything under this bill <e> <s> but how do you translate that into money which is not degrading to human nature <e>", "<cs> i can undertake to consider the point <e> <s> the text as it stands is probably ambiguous in the sense implied by the noble lord lord mishcon and his reference to <e>", "<cs> the best and shortest thing i can say to the noble lord is that i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much have liked to do more for the noble lord lord mishcon than i am going to do but the more that i think about this matter the more i feel that my instincts about it were originally right <e> <s> i have to go back to first principles <e> <s> lord campbells act and the law remains as it was under that act quite definitely confined a right of action for damages by a deceaseds relative to cases of actual financial loss <e> <s> that was done for a very good reason namely that it is i suppose degrading to human nature in some senses to try to turn the grief that one feels at bereavement into money <e> <s> the noble lord lord foot was kind enough to agree with a number of rhetorical questions that i put at an earlier stage the kind of questions which one would have to go into if this matter were to be taken into account at all <e> <s> the scots have gone down that road but i and the government have deliberately not done so <e> <s> the extreme view which i privately hold was expressed in the earlier debates by my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson who took very strongly the view which i have put and said nothing at all for grief <e> <s> i thought that and i have made that plain throughout <e>", "<cs> i shall not repeat myself in the subsequent amendments <e> <s> i simply rise to confirm what the noble lord lord mishcon said at the outset of his remarks <e> <s> at second reading i undertook to give to the promoters of the bill the advantage of the technical assistance in drafting which my office sometimes has at its command in order to ensure that the bill if it should meet with the approval of the committee in other respects would be technically correct so far as the drafting could make it <e> <s> that does not alter the stance of neutrality which the government adopt traditionally in relation to private members bills but it does mean i hope that it will not fail for want of good draftsmanship <e> <s> therefore i am happy with that qualification only to accept the noble lords amendment and the others which stand in his name <e>", "<cs> i think i can best answer the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon whose reasons for moving this amendment i can understand by referring back to clause of the bill which reads as follows <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the noble lord lord mishcon except on one important particular <e> <s> i agree that if the word had simply been inaccurate or incorrect in subsection it would be open to lord mishcon to say there are plenty of things which may be accurate but which may none the less be incomplete <e> <s> but the phrase used in the draft is inaccurate or misleading and our view is that any information which in a material particular is incomplete and is calculated to deceive which would certainly be the case in the example he gave is misleading because it leads to a false conclusion and that is what i understand misleading to mean <e>", "<cs> i think i might best answer this argument by an example <e> <s> supposing all the data in a computer were destroyed and therefore lost by a devastating fire or a devastating flood without any fault whatever on the part of the data user it would surely turn proceedings for what is under clause a breach of the eighth principle in the first schedule <e>", "<cs> i ought to say that i have five pages of foolscap to read out <e> <s> i may be able to be helpful up to a point <e> <s> clause is concerned with compensation for inaccurate information and the point revolves round the provision which deals with the received-status exception as i think one has come to know it in the jargon of this rather esoteric subject in subsection <e> <s> i think that lurking behind the <e>", "<cs> the only effect of this would be to make the thing be done without delay instead of as soon as practicable which means that it would have to be done even when it was not practicable to do it so soon <e> <s> i do not think therefore that it is clearer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do congratulate the noble lord on his succinctness and on the persuasive way in which he has moved the amendment <e> <s> i cannot offer the noble lord a great deal of hope as regards this amendment <e> <s> it is of course another amendment designed to identify as vulnerable a particular group on the grounds that they have made a request to consult a solicitor under clause and delay in compliance was authorised by subsection that is to say was perfectly properly obtained unless the confession is supported by other evidence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the law society for raising this question and to the noble lord lord mishcon for ventilating it in the committee <e> <s> as the noble lord has told the committee as drafted the bill allows the donor the power to appoint an attorney <e>", "<cs> this is again a matter in regard to which i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for ventilating <e> <s> it involves a slightly more technical and possibly a slightly longer reply on my part <e> <s> it is not easy to explain this in words of one syllable but i shall try to be as simple as i can <e>", "<cs> i am grateful again to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> this amendment was proposed i think not because it was believed that the provision was objectionable in substance but precisely and the noble lord lord mishcon has confirmed it because there was a similar provision in clause and it was believed therefore that clause <e>", "<cs> so far as concerns consultation which is really independent of the terms of either of the two amendments to which the noble lord has spoken it is certainly my policy to consult both with the law society and with the senate on any matters in which they are legitimately interested <e> <s> i certainly shall subject to anything that i may be told that i have said out of place give the assurance that the noble lord lord mishcon requires <e> <s> of course these regulations will have to be considered in conjunction with the profession and the judiciary and the ordinary parties with whom consultation is made <e>", "<cs> may i ask leave to consider this further <e> <s> i find it hard to envisage circumstances in which real harm would result from leaving out the words which the amendment would insert but there can be no objection in principle to the noble lords amendment <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord will agree to withdraw it i will undertake to consider further whether there is a potential <e>", "<cs> this is a more substantial matter which i shall probe at a little greater length <e> <s> it is quite true as the noble lord lord mishcon said that the farrand committee assumed rightly that what we were primarily dealing with under the original austin mitchell bill and its terms of reference was domestic conveyancing <e> <s> that is a perfectly fair comment to make <e> <s> but it did not recommend that licensed conveyancers should be restricted to only domestic conveyancing work however that expression is to be defined <e> <s> therefore although it had its sights on domestic conveyancing it was not restricted in that way <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that the amendment would limit the persons who may be bound by the new notice procedure to those affected by actions relating to trusts or to the estates of deceased persons <e> <s> this is the intention of the clause <e> <s> of course the sidenote is something from which judges have to avert their eyes on occasion and the explanatory memorandum dies with the bill when it becomes an act <e> <s> on the other hand i think that this raises a point which deserves consideration <e> <s> it raises a point about the scope of the clause which has substance in that subsection and subsection could be construed to give the clause a wider scope than is intended <e> <s> however the wording of this particular amendment is defective <e> <s> if the noble lord agrees to withdraw his amendment i will undertake to <e>", "<cs> this amendment would restrict the exercise of the county courts jurisdiction in contested probate matters to courts specially designated by the lord chancellor for that purpose <e> <s> there are of course parallels as the noble lord lord mishcon has rightly pointed out for a suggestion of this kind divorce bankruptcy admiralty and race relations <e> <s> these are specialised areas of the law where jurisdiction is assigned or confined to particular courts but in this field of contested probate matters county courts have exercised jurisdiction to handle them for well over years and the amendment would in effect remove the jurisdiction from all but specially designated county courts <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid we are in disagreement with one another <e> <s> the subsection sought to be amended is line of page which provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for raising this question again <e> <s> indeed i think that it was i who suggested in correspondence between us that it would be fair to do so <e> <s> i rise really only to confirm what he has said and to tell the house as i think the house is entitled to be told that the revenue has agreed to help in encouraging the establishment and use of enduring powers of attorney by so modifying its normal practice as to allow the acceptance of tax returns submitted on behalf of a donor by an attorney holding a registered enduring power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reverting to this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon in moving his amendment very fairly said that it was moved in committee and that although i promised to look at the matter again i did not open the door to hope very wide <e> <s> the amendment which we are discussing would empower the discipline and appeals committee in the new structure to hear and determine any allegations or complaints against licensed conveyancers which the investigating committee had turned down and declined to refer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can give it some quite favourable consideration on the basis of my letter to the noble lord but only in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm that these amendments in their present form are acceptable to the government and are indeed the result of a considerable exchange of correspondence with my department <e> <s> i am very happy to accept them <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how much i appreciate the work of the law society in administering this scheme <e> <s> i am sure that that is true of those who have been my predecessors since the legal aid scheme was introduced and those noble and learned lords who are here have indicated so to me <e> <s> it has been a great service to the nation and the legal aid board when established will have a great deal to learn from the society <e> <s> i am sure that the experience gained over the past years will be immensely valuable <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord should feel that a contracting-out option is dangerous <e> <s> i hope that it may prove an extremely useful and cost-effective option <e> <s> however i recognise the concern that he has expressed that the service provided by those contracting with the board to provide advice and assistance should be a good service of a proper quality <e>", "<cs> i should make it absolutely clear at the outset that it is the governments clear intention that duty solicitor arrangements <e> <s> both for magistrates courts and police stations should continue to operate <e> <s> the administration of them will be transferred to the board which may well have its own views on how they should best be organised and run so i cannot guarantee that the precise details of the present arrangements will stand for all time <e> <s> what i can however say is that this amendment is quite unnecessary to continue the duty solicitor arrangements <e>", "<cs> there are very few areas in which private persons can incur public expenditure and expect it to be reimbursed without prior approval <e> <s> on the other hand for the green form scheme to work it is highly necessary that where a person wishes advice he should be able to go to a solicitor and get some without having to go for prior approval <e> <s> it is the limit to be set for that that is in question in these amendments <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he be kind enough to explain how his amendment meets the difficulty for the individually legally-aided litigant to whom the master of the rolls referred <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to be sweet but i am not sure that i can be quite so short <e>", "<cs> this is not an omission without consideration <e> <s> in other words it is not an omission by mistake <e> <s> it is a deliberate omission and i shall try to explain why <e>", "<cs> the situation on these matters is that as the noble lord knows notification provisions form an important part of the rules of court currently applying to care proceedings in a magistrates court <e> <s> we intend to improve the present provisions in relation to procedure but i assure the noble lord that we intend to meet his concerns in rules of court as best we can <e> <s> it seems to me that notification matters are matters best dealt with in the rules of court <e>", "<cs> we are in this clause talking about emergency protection of children and i accept that the words immediate removal could be said to help to convey this flavour <e> <s> however i fear that inclusion of the word immediately would undermine the philosophy of the clause <e> <s> first the order may be made <e>", "<cs> although the earlier amendment and this amendment both deal with the medical examination this amendment deals with it in the context of the emergency protection order where the childs consent may be less important <e> <s> one can imagine a situation where an abused child under a parents influence would refuse <e> <s> therefore the considerations are different but i undertake to consider both amendments without necessarily the same result <e>", "<cs> the idea of this provision which is as it were under attack is to allow the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords until the noble lord explained the amendment i had some difficulty in understanding what was intended <e> <s> there may well be circumstances in which more than one guardian should he appointed <e> <s> i take it from what the noble lord has said that he is anxious to ensure that the guardian appointed under clause will not take over from the parent <e> <s> i think that that is the effect of the guardian appointment anyway <e> <s> i had rather assumed <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment is to require rules of court to provide a procedure by which a child may apply to be joined as a party to proceedings or apply to start proceedings <e> <s> there is already power to provide a procedure to enable a child to exercise his rights under clause to start proceedings by applying for an order <e> <s> further in so far as he will be entitled to be a party to proceedings under clause again there is already power to provide for the procedure to be followed <e> <s> i can assure the house in so far as any assurance is needed that we shall make whatever procedural arrangements are necessary to allow the child to exercise those rights <e>", "<cs> my lords when drawing up a timetable the court will have to be realistic and will have to take account of all the circumstances otherwise it will simply not be adhered to <e> <s> many things may affect the matter for example whether medical or welfare reports have to be obtained when parties are available and so on <e> <s> plainly if parents are facing difficulties because they are abroad that too would be taken into account <e> <s> but so could the fact that they are hospitalised or are on a walking trip in wales or are uncontactable for some other reason <e> <s> perhaps rather than living abroad they are simply on a holiday <e> <s> it really cannot make sense to tack on to the timetable power one of the very many matters which in particular cases may be relevant <e> <s> doing so is not only illogical unless a pretty near definitive list is provided but may also suggest that the factor mentioned is somehow more significant than others and thus be misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the proposal would be to allow the court in care proceedings to make a new kind of order an adjournment order when an application for an order is made <e> <s> i have some difficulty with this point <e> <s> as i explained previously in committee the rules of court will provide for adjournments and we do not think that their use should be encouraged unless they are necessary for the case to proceed <e> <s> adjournments contribute to delays which we are anxious to keep to the minimum and i would not wish to introduce a provision which runs counter to this <e>", "<cs> the amendment would move the structure of the bill away from establishing clearly what the security service is required to do and instead replace it by injunctions about what the security service is required not to do <e> <s> i do not believe that that is necessary nor do i think it helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords at page line at end insert the words as printed on the marshalled list with a bracket inserted after the word doing <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know anyone may complain to the tribunal if he is aggrieved about anything which he believes the service to have done in relation to him <e> <s> this may of course include a complaint about the role of the security service in relation to some employment matter <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be perfectly reasonable for me to accept the amendment <e> <s> it may be that on consideration parliamentary counsel will wish to finish it in some way because the phraseology is perhaps not the most expedient <e> <s> however in order to make progress i shall accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could i make it clear that i said that is my intention <e> <s> i hope i shall be able to carry it out <e> <s> i do not give a full undertaking because we have not yet completely solved the difficult question but i certainly have every intention of bringing forward an amendment if i possibly can in time for report <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the intention of this amendment but i doubt whether it is a matter which should be dealt with in the bill <e> <s> my intention is that the advisory committee should be enabled to conduct a modest programme of research <e> <s> paragraph of schedule gives the committee power to regulate its own procedure and i think that decisions on whether part of the grant-in-aid should be used for research <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider further how this matter should be dealt with <e> <s> the public of course includes all those who are disadvantaged <e> <s> the general includes the particular <e> <s> i can see a possible advantage in having a specific reference to that group of people <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i should like to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> the committee has a general advisory function but in relation to advocacy and litigation it has a particular and more central function <e> <s> that role would be weakened if its advice on advocacy and litigation matters carried no more weight than that on other legal services issues <e> <s> the government remain committed to the principle that in the first instance the maintenance of standards in legal services is a matter for the professional bodies themselves <e> <s> the general objective in this part of the bill of developing legal services gives the advisory committee a role to play <e> <s> but that role has been carefully drawn so as not to impinge unduly on the independence of the professions <e> <s> i consider that the correct balance between complete professional independence and the right of the users of legal services to have their voice heard in advice through the medium of the committee is struck with the present requirement that the professional bodies should be under an obligation to have regard to the committees advice only to the extent that it relates to advocacy or litigation because that is the statutory matter that is central to its role <e> <s> it is for that reason that this limitation is included and that i do not feel able to accept the amendment <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that explanation the noble lord may feel able to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> while i see the point that the noble lord makes on the second amendment i regret that i do not think it would be right to accept this and indeed it would not be right to give it favourable consideration <e> <s> the fact that somebody has been bogged down or gagged by a legal process <e>", "<cs> as i have already said i fully support the idea that by one means or another clients must be protected <e> <s> that i believe is achieved in two ways <e> <s> first under clause b to which the noble lord lord mishcon has referred it is a prerequisite for authorisation that an authorised practitioner must have satisfactory arrangements in force for covering adequately the risk of any claim <e> <s> the board shall authorise a person to provide those services if it is of the opinion that the applicant will comply with the requirements mentioned in subsection <e> <s> in other words it must see that satisfactory arrangements are in place for a particular practitioner to be authorised <e> <s> that means that generally speaking the practitioner must be insured <e>", "<cs> the powers the bill confers on the board are aimed to enable it to perform its duties of authorising and supervising practitioners in a way that is light and flexible as well as effective <e> <s> under clause b the board has a general duty to supervise the activities of authorised practitioners and by clause the board will make arrangements designed to enable it to ascertain whether authorised practitioners are complying with the regulations which the lord chancellor will make if parliament so decides <e> <s> further under clause d the board may make rules concerning transitional arrangements for dealing with any work in hand should an authorised practitioners authorisation be revoked or suspended <e> <s> those would vary according to the circumstances <e>", "<cs> it is appropriate in this arrangement for the ombudsman to have the kind of powers that are here in question <e> <s> we have endeavoured to provide in the new schedule a an amendment to deal with this matter <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> ya provides the opening to it <e> <s> there is then a schedule of detailed powers for the ombudsman <e>", "<cs> i regard clause b as dealing with qualifications <e> <s> clause c is intended to deal with the continuity of control <e> <s> i intend to provide that the properly qualified person should be continuously in control of a transaction and that it should not pass from one qualified person to another <e>", "<cs> both in the green paper and in carrying the matter through it has been my view that something of that kind is required in the regulations <e> <s> i believe that the powers that the bill confers are sufficient to enable that to be done <e> <s> i certainly have every intention of including a requirement on those lines in the regulations <e>", "<cs> a power to make arrangements along these lines is already indicated as it were as a particular in subsection e <e> <s> this is a matter on which i should certainly wish to consult in detail because there are many detailed matters that would have to be dealt with in relation to this area if it were to be the subject of regulations <e> <s> the noble lord may therefore take it that i shall have this very much in mind as a matter to be considered in relation to the reglations <e> <s> i shall undertake full consultation upon them when they are drawn <e>", "<cs> whatever may be the superficial attraction of this new clause i suggest that it should not form part of the bill <e> <s> its origin lies in concern that the conveyancing activities of authorised practitioners might lead to a decline in the provision of legal aid services <e> <s> although i do not agree that there is real foundation for that fear i doubt both the practicality of the new clause and whether it can serve any useful purpose <e> <s> it will certainly be very difficult at the very least in the time-scale provided for to determine the exact impact of any one factor on the general availability of legal aid services <e> <s> indeed i am seeking to make some investigations at present in another connection in relation to the spread or distribution of these services <e>", "<cs> it is the same sort of matter that we dealt with previously in relation to another part of the bill <e> <s> the existing power is really sufficient to enable proper regulation to be made <e> <s> of course it has the effect of ensuring that the regulations may be amended from time to time in the light of experience <e> <s> therefore they can be improved if any loophole or defect turned out to be present in existing regulations <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take it that i shall consider carefully what should be done but that he will also bear in mind that i believe that the ordinary drafting mechanism of the word may is adequate for this purpose <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider this amendment perhaps i should say favourably in the sense that we may be able to do something in the direction which the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> this depends on whether the board has any jurisdiction in this area <e> <s> as i indicated in answer to the noble lord lord prys-davies so far i am not persuaded that it is desirable to extend the conveyancing boards functions into this area <e> <s> therefore it follows that the amendment would go out of this jurisdiction along with the board <e>", "<cs> the general route that we have proposed is that a right of audience in a court held for a sufficient time confers the necessary qualification to be a judge of that court <e> <s> so far as concerns solicitors and others who have been judges in a court below service in the court below will also be a qualification <e> <s> that could result in solicitors reaching the high court bench much more quickly than in the kind of period mentioned by the noble lord again obviously subject to a suitable candidate <e> <s> none of these is more than a qualification <e> <s> it does not at all mean that anyone with the qualification would necessarily be a suitable person <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the suggestion in the amendment <e> <s> if he will allow me i should like to consider it carefully <e> <s> this is a difficult area in which to operate <e> <s> the building societies act has a provision like this but i am <e>", "<cs> the idea of the clause is to provide customer protection against tying in so that the customer can insist that each service involved in a transaction should be priced separately and be available separately <e> <s> separate pricing enables the customer to choose which services if any he wants and discourages the person offering the services from offering them at a loss <e> <s> separate pricing is achieved by clause <e> <s> the amendment seeks to discourage lenders from offering a package of services to a customer at a discount <e> <s> at first sight that does not appear to be in the interests of the customer or client <e>", "<cs> the line that the noble lord has suggested on the earlier amendments might make it unnecessary to pursue amendment no <e> <s> la <e> <s> the amendment which defines services to include <e>", "<cs> the effect of this clause would be to have the payment made
