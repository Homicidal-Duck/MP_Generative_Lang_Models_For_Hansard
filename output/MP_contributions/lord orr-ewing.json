set matters right and attract these exploration rigs back to the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to press the government to proceed with legislation <e> <s> it seems ridiculous to continue with an old out-of-date policy which is against the present elected governments manifesto particularly denying the money which comes from pay beds when modern equipment such as

stake <e> <s> is he aware that it is not just the convenience of parliament which is of course of great importance that is involved but the vital and very essential and sensitive services in different parts of the country which will be affected by the campaign being run by this union <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that there are many other people in this country who believe that it is very important that we should retain this deterrent <e> <s> we would not wish france to be the only country in western europe operating a nuclear deterrent <e> <s> we are sharing the burden

entertainment <e> <s> it seems that the same excuse has come out of the same pigeon-hole years later <e> <s> will my noble friend bear in mind that the capability of a person to operate a radio telephone is not affected by either complexion or height <e>", "<cs> my lords once when my noble friends father-in-law had been accused of changing his mind he said the processes of my mind constantly

house to go to moscow or to the united nations if thereby he could persuade them not to deploy the ss with its -mile range and multi-missile head in increasing numbers threatening every member of the nato organisation <e> <s> and in the meantime as the ussr have already by their propaganda persuaded western europe that they no longer have the option of deploying the neutron bomb can we continue to

on to say that it is not unusual for a government to have to take that step particularly when the previous government have planned an expansion of per cent <e> <s> in productivity which just did not arise <e> <s> at that time by the way the government also had a mlr of per cent <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kaldor knows only too well <e> <s> they had all those things which we are now doing and i cannot think it is by accident that that was the period when they began to get control of the economy and control of inflation which went successively down from then until june when it reached per cent <e> <s> so we are looking at rather a similar set of conditions and i cannot think why they condemn cuts in public expenditure now when they did the same themselves and when it was effective in producing results <e>", "<cs> my lords my fear is that one is going to create the unemployment before the other one picks up and creates the new jobs <e> <s> i am not pessimistic and i am sorry that i

noble baroness but she has made reference to me <e> <s> i should like to point out that our view is that we need to create jobs in wealth-creating industries <e> <s> from the creation of those jobs and from the prosperity of exports we can then afford a good public expenditure side <e> <s> in fact we have kept total public expenditure about the same <e> <s> we hope to expand the private sector so that percentage-wise public expenditure will be less <e> <s> but the worry is that people choose to make the cuts where it hurts the public in places like old peoples homes and the like and do not cut the bureaucrats at source <e> <s> thus we end up with more administrators in the health service than doctors and nurses and more administrators in education than teachers <e> <s> we think that that seems to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the biggest cut has been in the inland revenue <e> <s> but is he also aware that compared to the united states of america we still have four times as many tax gatherers as they have per of the population <e> <s> is this not an argument for not only going on cutting taxes but above all simplifying taxation so that it is easier to handle our taxation more efficiently with fewer civil servants <e> <s> would he bear in mind that although the intended cuts are satisfactory here it is not so in the local authorities where in the last year they have added people to their numbers <e> <s> could he see what persuasion could be put on the local authorities by the government for them to make equal cuts and thus keep rates increases down <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that administration is now the greater part of the cost of provid <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this statement will be

good news first it is pleasing to learn that there will be an extra men under arms in the coming year <e> <s> that is very welcome after years of labour rule when the strength of our forces was cut

have collected their prescription from a qualified tester to take that prescription to any shop which could make up the glasses to meet their requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend

continue particularly in south wales at the present time when the need to open up new and productive pits and to invest large sums in modernising profitable coal mines is so desperately essential for the well-being of our nation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether in the majority of this very large number of routine closures alternative employment in nearby mines has been offered to the miners <e> <s> and can he say whether the very rigid attitude in south wales which suggests that no further closures will ever be allowed is influenced by the fact that the executive of the national union of miners there is entirely dominated by people with communist affiliations <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he assure the house that when all the representations concering this green paper have been received the government will put into the queens speech a statement that they are prepared to legislate to put matters right should representations be made to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are headmasters and

wealth <e> <s> i do not think anyone would disagree with that <e> <s> i can see from this debate that of course there are agonising areas and if local authorities have not cut their staffs where they ought to have cut them and have cut areas where people are deeply dependent on the support of local authorities that is not something which we can dictate from a government position <e> <s> it must be by the local authorities being pressurised by their local representatives to make the cuts where they are not so painful and to preserve the services where they are really meeting the needs of the under-privileged the poverty-stricken and the ill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i agree <e> <s> we have had some very disturbing evidence on this matter <e> <s> but i do not think that i can depart from the main thrust of my argument which is that we have to get public expenditure under control <e> <s> we have to encourage the private sector to generate the wealth of this country which pays for our imports and underpins our social services <e> <s> unless you get that going you cannot afford to index fully all the social services <e> <s> i accept the argument that you should not cut the voluntary services because they are most cost-effective and most compassionate because they are dealing with people they are caring people dedicating their lives to helping the unfortunate <e> <s> i hope that the private sector is investing for the future and all my evidence in the companies with which i work shows that they are and as the recession begins to fade we shall then be better placed

hope that i might have an opportunity to thank the foreign secretary personally for the hard work which he undertakes for the country in general and for our house in particular and secondly to draw attention to the fact that the imbalance of visible trade between this country and japan is now about million per annum in deficit <e> <s> the agony that this is creating for our motor industry and electronics industry is alarming <e> <s> can my noble friend assure us that if an agreement has been arrived at further talks will go on in japan so that we can make sure that some of the assurances that the japanese have given will be honoured and that we shall then see them opening their borders to our exports as well as restricting imports to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do not these figures belie the suggestion that the government are doing nothing to promote research and development in industry <e> <s> would the noble viscount tell the house how much in addition to this is spent by private industry in carrying out research and development on behalf of the ministry of defence <e> <s>

contemplating chartering rather than building a rig and if that knowledge was available whether british shipbuilders or one of their companies had an opportunity of chartering a rig after constructing

they build ships on spec and then either sell them to their customers or incorporate them into their navy <e> <s> they do this in many other respects <e> <s> does this make competition fair <e> <s> ought the bnoc to consider the vast numbers of unemployed in birkenhead where this work would not only have benefited people directly for two years but would have benefited a further people in the sub-contractors particularly in the steel industry which is badly in need of work of this type <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would like to compliment my noble friend on his initial introductory speech and perhaps sympathise with the noble lord lord ponsonby not because of the length of his speech but because he had to pronounce from that front bench that everything we were doing would lead to gloom doom bankruptcies and poverty of service <e> <s> it has not been so in the past <e> <s> the post office have had and perhaps rightly in the past a hundred years start <e> <s> i believe they are so good that they will compete <e> <s> let us remember that every new facility and every new service which comes forward will make use of the public post office network and thereby benefit with extra services extra charges and extra revenue coming from the additional apparatus which is attached to that network <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> could the noble lord perhaps have an instance where we have totally nationalised and de-nationalised an entire industry <e> <s> every time they come to power they nationalise something extra and add to the burden of the public sector <e> <s> we have only nibbled at the fringes and tried to introduce an element of competition <e> <s> is this not reasonable <e>", "<cs> what about the united states system my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that a joint venture of this kind between two countries as a result of a memorandum of understanding is highly desirable since it means a sharing of the development the early production costs and the trials of these potentially successful helicopters <e> <s> will he therefore give this a favourable push in the right direction so that we can get on and help to meet these considerable markets both civil and military which are going to be available within this decade <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the technologies incorporated in these two new torpedoes cover electronics engineering and underwater that they all have a considerably advanced background and as my noble friend will remember from his days in the ministry for industry that they are potential growth areas for jobs in this country <e> <s> therefore it is extremely important that we should encourage home development home production and the jobs which will go with them <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend reaches a decision could he take into consideration whether other operators might be more enthusiastic whether either united states operators or british independent operators might operate this aircraft on profitable routes because

desirable if a committee is to be set up that its terms of reference and membership should be considered by the unions and the government at the earliest possible moment so that we can get on with

this is the first time successive governments have met the dates required by the commission and/or the court <e> <s> there were six delays under the labour government and a further three much shorter

noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton his solicitors and three advisers from the tuc turned up for the very first time in the four and a quarter years that this case has lasted and submitted pages of

go for an eye test before buying a pair of reading glasses <e> <s> will my noble friend at least make it clear to the nation as a whole that until such time as mrs oppenheim the minister for consumer affairs gets into this act they will be well advised to ask the person who tests their eyes for a prescription so that they can <e>", "<cs> i want to raise a point in a slightly different context <e>

of kilgerran <e> <s> however i could have been much more embarrassed if it had been somebody elses name which headed each of these amendments rather than that of the noble lord lord lloyd because broadly i agree with most of them <e> <s> nevertheless when the bill is reprinted i hope that i shall not automatically be associated with every amendment which he puts down <e>", "<cs> i should just like to add my voice <e>", "<cs> i take exactly the opposite view <e> <s> am i right in thinking that per cent <e> <s> of the homes in this country or a figure of that order have a single telephone <e> <s> if that is so are we not by leaving this phrase in the bill restricting the competition very considerably and making sure that per cent <e> <s> of the domestic users do not feel any of the winds of competition at all in any of the choices which they are meant to be given under this bill or in any of the liberalising factors under the bill <e> <s> admittedly if they are prepared to pay the extra money they can presumably get someone to disconnect their telephone and put in a fancy one which they may prefer <e> <s> however that is a very small choice <e>", "<cs> it is true that in the rural areas the circumstances are different but in a town it is a question if the cable is in your roadway of getting someone to come along and generally it is two or three people to extend the line into your house at a terminal point which i hope will be a plug and socket <e> <s> thereafter a person could plug in his telephone and arrange for other rooms in his house to be wired so that the telephone could be plugged into another room for instance a bedroom for evenings and nights or perhaps in a further room where a person is sick <e> <s> that would give the greatest flexibility and the optimum use of capital equipment <e>", "<cs> i was comforted by the phrase used by my noble friend lord gowrie at present the first prime instrument will remain british telecoms monopoly because that signifies that perhaps a time may come when it will be less monopolistic <e> <s> i was not persuaded by the noble lord lord ponsonby saying that testing a telephone was a highly technical business <e> <s> if my telephone goes wrong i say to the engineer if i can get through you put your instrument on the end and i will go round the dial <e> <s> he replies ok guv and i then dial and all the way round the dial and i am told if there is a fault on the timing of my dial <e> <s> there may be some other fault and on the whole the telephone instruments are not the things that go wrong and more and more as we come to solid state microprocessors and the like it will not be those parts that go wrong <e> <s> the fault is generally in the wiring between ones home and the nearest telephone pole or further down the line perhaps in rural areas a branch or tree has fallen across the line <e> <s> very seldom have i found the fault to be the telephone itself <e> <s> so i was not greatly inspired by the argument of the noble lord lord ponsonby <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies may i say that i think it is very difficult when one wants to liberalise and have competition to ensure that it is fair competition <e> <s> i would support the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> i had two experiences in my industrial life of trying to compete with british steel <e> <s> to try to run your own steel stockholders when they are running steel stockholders in competition with you and when they have a special tie line to british steel is very difficult particularly when you have to raise your

rate <e>", "<cs> one firm <e>", "<cs> i take a contrary view i am afraid my noble friend seems to favour the monopoly in every way <e> <s> i agree that martlesham does very good work but for every that is spent on research about times that is spent on development and to put that into production whether it be by the post office or the private sector is generally times that <e> <s> the tooling up and putting into production now with automatic assembly means the ratio from research going up to times <e> <s> one can therefore quite cheaply do a number of research projects but as one who has spent the whole of his working life in the electronics industry i assure the committee that it is not the starting of research which is difficult but deciding what to cut out of the development and

over-designed entirely over-expensive and therefore not exportable <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i deployed my arguments on this point i hope reasonably effectively at second reading <e> <s> it was argued that there was no case for an intermediary body <e> <s> i would argue that a small bureaucracy albeit a quango is better than a large bureaucracy <e> <s> there are people on the staff of the

around as they are promoted up the ladder <e> <s> in a smaller bureaucracy you can engage staff on a programme contract as it were for a short time <e> <s> in a smaller bureaucracy it can be more specialised and more in touch with a highly technological industry and have more expertise <e> <s> therefore i still support the idea that an authority of this type not necessarily with these terms of reference would be a considerable gain for the government and for this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend have discussions with the minister of defence to see whether some volunteers might not be trained with the armed forces <e> <s> not only would they be subject to some discipline but they would receive very good preparation for future jobs in the civilian market <e> <s> it seems odd that one area where they cannot volunteer and where we are badly in need of extra manpower is the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i understood from my noble friends first reply that he said that passport applications were not being delivered to the passport office owing to industrial action <e> <s> is this because the post office are not delivering <e> <s> if so would it not come under

also to say that i am persuaded by some of the logic which my noble friend has presented to the committee <e> <s> i think that it is in order for a monopoly to borrow from its present users which is what was condemned by the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> he said that he did not think it right for present day subscribers to have to pay for the future <e> <s> that is exactly what happened when the bbc started <e> <s> there were no television licences at all sound broadcasting licences financed television for its first years <e> <s> now the situation is the reverse and television licences provide the money and sound broadcasting is thrown in free <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not constitutional dangers in the fact that this country has no written constitution <e> <s> we have no bill of rights <e> <s> it is certainly unlikely that in the short term we shall have any electoral reform <e> <s> does my noble friend recall that the lord chancellor delivered an exceptional dimbleby tv lecture drawing attention to the danger of an elective dictatorship and wherein it was shown that a minority government of extreme views could be a considerable danger to our whole constitution <e>

protect our parliamentary system <e> <s> so the suggestion he made in his first reply that the government are examining this matter is welcome <e> <s> would he say that there is some sense of urgency about this examination <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend remind the house and i declare an interest what percentage of the total rate comes from ilea and what from the police precept <e> <s> these two precepts surely represent the majority of the rate burden <e> <s> and is it not true that under the new left-wing dominance of the glc the intention has been announced that it is intended to have no financial restrictions in these areas and this will probably necessitate an extra rate demand in the autumn as a result of their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it is not a fact that in the current year the national coal board have been allocated after depreciation million for capital expenditure <e> <s> if this capital expenditure allocation is diverted to make good losses in the revenue area surely this has serious repercussions for those companies which are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is it not time that a better method was introduced whereby monies granted for capital expenditure should be used for capital expenditure and should not be used to subsidise uneconomic competition against the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of the figures he has given the house will be of tremendous encouragement and have drawn attention to the need to improve the system of control so that capital expenditure is used for modernisation of our nationalised industries and to provide jobs in the private sector who meet these needs <e> <s> is he aware that bsc only in recent months has spent million buying up a private steel stockholders in the midlands and that does not create extra jobs <e> <s> it only means that you are using public money to subsidise and to compete against the private sector and this tends to be inefficient and is certainly not the intention of her majestys present government <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is widespread interest in all parties in both houses and throughout the country in some form of <e>", "<cs> my

independent airlines <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that only when laker airways and others came in on the transatlantic routes were fares substantially lowered <e> <s> is he further aware that british airways are currently circulating members of parliament asking them to discourage competition by british midland on the route between london and glasgow on the shuttle <e> <s> this is another instance where a single monopoly tends to keep prices up and competition will lower prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like the provision where clause states quite clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really hopeful that for the first time i think i have taken part in the debates on a number of amendments to successive bills first the employment bill and now this bill both dealt with by my noble friend and always with elegance courtesy and efficiency this proposal that the secretary of state should publish an annual account might be accepted <e> <s> surely every single major corporation produces an annual account <e> <s> they have consumer councils as pounc does in this case and it is a perfectly customary arrangement <e> <s> i feel sure that of all the nationalised industries british telecom with a virtual monopoly even after this bill would not want to be the only one which does not publish an annual account <e> <s> it is of such importance to so many people in this country that i think it is right that an annual account should be published <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend wrong in referring to leaving it to the good sense of parliament <e> <s> we cannot probe into the details of nationalised industries into their price structures into their policies into delays in issuing licences or into whether licences have been given <e> <s> none of that is open to us to discuss in detail <e> <s> only the broad structure and capital expenditure of the nationalised industries come under the control of parliament <e> <s> it is a problem that parliament has not yet resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he did not mention amendment no <e> <s> a and the new clause in which i mentioned without delay and with reasons <e> <s> there are many ways of belling the cat and one of the ways about which government departments are very wise is an unconscionable delay in giving decisions <e> <s> delays in competitive industry are very expensive if you are using your own money paying heavy interest and waiting for some pay-back <e> <s> can my noble friend assure us that there will not be unconscionable delay and that when licences are rejected by the secretary of state the person applying will at least be given some explanation that will allow him to direct his attentions to modifying the apparatus that he is developing and then to resubmit it for inspection purposes to see whether he can market it <e> <s> could my noble friend deal with those points and if i am reasonably satisfied and i am sure that i shall be because my noble friend is very co-operative in these areas i shall then beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> perhaps he could deal with those points first <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether or not it is true that the ambulancemen are wishing to consolidate all the various payments that they now get for unsocial hours for overtime and for other special circumstances in their basic pay henceforward <e> <s> if this were to be brought about is it not true that they would then be getting a week <e> <s> would not this be disproportionate when one considers the amount that the other people in similar circumstances are receiving <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he will bear in mind that sometimes when you wait for co-ordination and for everything to be put right in one massive bill you may perpetrate an injustice <e> <s> would it not perhaps be quicker if this particular injustice were to be put right in a simple one clause bill rather than wait for the european community to come to an omnibus solution <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take the opportunity of reminding the opposition that the cut in the schools higher education programme is a reflection of the very much smaller number of people coming forward for educational purposes and that those cuts were made for reasons resulting from the drop in the birthrate many years ago no doubt in times of socialist rule by per cent <e> <s> whereas the actual cut in education is about per cent <e> <s> so in fact per head of the pupils in our schools there has been an increase in expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say in how many cases informal discussions with the office of fair trading have resulted in voluntary changes in undesirable trading practices <e> <s> can he possibly say what proportion of the work of the office of fair trading is done in this effective unpublicised manner <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a hypothetical question if britains nuclear deterrent continues to remain effective <e> <s> was it not because of the labour governments desire that the deterrent should remain effective that they spent million on developing and producing the chevaline warheads for the polaris missile force <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend reflect that after all the anxieties and the gloom and doom which has been forecast i think from most of us in this house and in the other this is a realistic and a constructive statement surprisingly so <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that perhaps one of the most anxious points is the further rundown in uniformed personnel in all three services but particularly in the army and that the decision to build up our reserves will be most welcome <e> <s> but does this action not reflect the fact that three all-professional armed services are now becoming very expensive indeed <e> <s> does he realise that no other western european nation has been able to form this structure for their armed forces but have had to make use of national service or some other form of reserve and will he now examine whether we cannot look to the next decade for some reassessment of all professional services so that we can save money and give young men an opportunity of serving in a disciplined force <e> <s> they may be very valuable should an emergency arise <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether consultations have taken place with the relevant trade unions and whether the maximum cooperation is being achieved in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider asking our delegate at the madrid conference which is considering the outcome of helsinki to draw attention to the fact that helsinki laid it down very firmly that human rights should be a matter of very high priority and does not this particular imprisonment make a farce of the signature which the russians put on that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend point out that while the soviet union is deploying every single week an extra ss nuclear weapon in their area aimed at western europe it is very difficult for us to take seriously any disarmament talk <e>", "<cs> and that the west is compelled to deploy some cruise missiles unless the soviet union stops and withdraws those other ss missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the orderpaper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the high technology industries particularly aerospace are still woefully short of people with

welcome initiative <e> <s> i shall therefore seek to put down a further question when we reassemble to see what progress has been made since this was launched at the beginning of may <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider whether in new york and only spread throughout the immense rest of the united states is a proper weighting <e> <s> the effect in new york does not seem to have been

that some six or seven years ago in a longer speech he gave a very trenchant presentation of the dangers which beset us <e> <s> he is right in saying that they have grown since then <e> <s> it is significant that that particular edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend will recall that many people both in this house and in another place find it very difficult to understand the act would it not be to the advantage of trade unions employers and others who have to try to administer this act not least our judges who find it tortuous while most of us find it incomprehensible if the government were to consider whether a clearer and more easily followed draft might replace the present act in the autumn when new legislation is contemplated to be brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are a number of members on this side of the house also who are anxious to see this matter properly reviewed in the forthcoming debate <e> <s> in the meantime he has brought up one reason which i do not think has previously emerged which is that this is a question of shuffling off the responsibility from the existing foreign office grant to perhaps some other ministry <e> <s> if that is the reason why we are suspending the transcription

ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that information <e> <s> is it not true that the united nations has now passed two resolutions asking that this matter should be investigated the last being on th december <e> <s> are not the wishes of the united nations being totally frustrated because the kabul administration are refusing to allow any investigators to visit afghanistan and the soviet authorities who are in control are equally refusing <e> <s> what can be done to expose crimes of this kind where according to a report to congress deaths have occurred as a result of the use of nerve gases toxic substances and other chemical warfare weapons <e> <s> what can we do to try to investigate the situation when local people will not allow in investigators <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider whether due to the frustrations of the united nations and even if pressure from all quarters does not yield any progress by the united nations the government should ask the international red cross to look into these accusations of the use of chemical weapons in as the noble lord lord avebury has said not only afghanistan but possibly eritrea as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will there in future be some form of easy communication between the client and the taxi driver <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that many visitors to london particularly those from over <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that as a result of these sales there is no question of the ratepayer subsidising them <e> <s> ratepayers

friend aware that it has been widely reported that as many as cases each week are reported of robbery from or within baggage going through london airport <e> <s> is it not a fact that since the volunteers took over that figure has dropped from to nought <e> <s> this is a highly effective and responsible action by those volunteers <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that these remarkably good figures are not widely known in the united states and other countries which are contemplating investment in this country and that the wider these figures do become known the better for future investment and therefore for jobs in this country <e> <s> at the same time could he possibly give us some figures which would show the disruption which occurs in industry and in our services as a result of go-slows work to rules or internecine quarrels <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can follow my noble kinsman who has just sat down too far on the point that he has made but i have no doubt that the select committee as well as the promoters of the bill will look at the matter <e> <s> it seems to me that if one is a financial institution one has to choose an interest between backing a broker or backing the underwriting agents <e> <s> but perhaps some compromise can be reached because certainly one would not wish to forgo the development of lloyds through lack of money through an inhibition accidentally built into this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the ratepayers of london have been sorely tried by profligate expenditure since mr ken livingstone took charge of the glc <e> <s> and has he considered that private financial institutions are ready to subscribe money and that it is unnecessary to depend upon public money taken from ratepayers <e> <s> has my noble friend also considered asking the glc to consider the private supply of money for viable enterprises which will create jobs rather than always relying on the sorely tried ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that there are large numbers of council houses which have been empty for more than a year <e> <s> am i right in thinking that of these empty houses are in the glc area <e> <s> is it not essential where there is an urgent housing shortage that these empty houses should be brought back to profitable and satisfactory occupation

mineral sphere over the next years of the areas around the falkland islands and that we should be happy to be associated after peace is secured with the argentine and perhaps others in bringing that potential to fruition thus improving the lot of the falkland islands and the general wealth of that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in name on the order paper

against the increasing soviet threat <e> <s> secondly is not one of the lessons that such ships as the leander class and the type although somewhat long in the tooth can be of great value in such operations and ought not these to be taken off the disposal list and maintained in short notice reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

to the new sea wolf system with the lightweight tracker radar <e>", "<cs> i come back to the question of security <e> <s> surely the bbc broadcast of the today programme at am and am on th may contained a whole lot of facts many of which were erroneous and the whole statement was laced with innuendoes which would sow distrust of the governments policy and mistrust of its missile policy <e>

statement was <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend understand that many of us are very pleased to

productivity continues to increase and does not diminish <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend consider seriously the suggestion from the liberal benches that the government of the day should really look at the disincentives and the complexities which are now necessary in share option schemes and which appear to be derived from a desire by the treasury to make sure that nobody gains anything worthwhile <e> <s> is it not an important part of industrial relations that share option schemes should be encouraged in every possible way so that people have a greater interest in the company for which they work <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the price would be reduced universally not by per cent <e> <s> which of itself would be satisfactory if it were universal

respect consideration of this matter has been two years delayed since my noble friend assured the house in january that it would be looked into <e> <s> is it really going to take another year for the office of fair trading to report <e> <s> is it not because that body and i have given evidence among other peers to it is manned on a part-time basis <e> <s> this is so important to the million purchasers of pairs of spectacles in a year that surely a little more speed and expedition can be exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order

large number of industries which are concerned with furniture carpeting the painting of houses and general construction benefit all sides of industry and this must be encouraged if we are to mop up some of the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that britain entered into this project with the support of the security council of the eec of nato of the commonwealth and of all

that the soviets have divisions massed on the northern iranian frontier and that it is a fair insurance policy that the americans should have facilities on diego-suarez just in case the worst happens in that part of the world to the great detriment of stability there and the raw materials supply of oil to the free world <e> <s> will my noble friend remind the house that we also offer facilities to the americans on ascension island and without those it would have been very difficult to carry out resolution of the security council in the relief of the occupation of the falkland islands by

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the good news that in a period of world recession our manufacturing output has increased by per cent <e> <s> can he perhaps tell the house

with anti-fire materials <e> <s> is not this the proper work of the royal dockyards and would it not be better therefore to feed the refitting and repair of the royal fleet auxiliaries to the ordinary competitive shipyards including those of british shipbuilders which is a nationalised industry in order to alleviate the desperate unemployment in places like tyneside and elsewhere which are urgently needing this work and could undertake it quickly and economically <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend reconsider the matter of stating as he did in one of his replies that royal fleet auxiliaries would be fed to the royal dockyards <e> <s> this is the grist of the task of the commercial sector whether it is british shipbuilders or the private yards and they are in woeful lack of

in trying to find solutions to the problems which beset britains public industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel that i am in a position to answer such a question <e> <s> all i am saying is that the price of electricity which we were promised was going to be reduced has not been reduced in real terms <e> <s> the electricity industry of course has to pay the very high price of coal in this country <e> <s> it could buy that coal at half the price if it was allowed to import other coal <e> <s> i agree that to do so would be anti-social but coal could be bought at a lower price and no doubt the noble lord lord ezra will deal with that point when he speaks later <e> <s> the manifesto goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that we go back to breaking up the railways <e> <s> i believe that there are many ways of decentralising railway organisation which would be of benefit <e> <s> no one has <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes my lords <e> <s> one can look all round the world and find many countries which have not thought it necessary to nationalise their electricity and all their infrastructure <e> <s> yet they are very successful and are competing very efficiently against our own products because their costs are lower <e> <s> one has only to look at other countries to see that infrastructure organisations and industries do succeed in the private sector and have succeeded in other parts of the world <e> <s> i return to the point that there is no explanation for the fact that there have been million of losses and grants loans and capital write-offs in the nationalised industries <e> <s> just think what could have been done in this country not only for social benefits but also in the creation of wealth if only half that money had been saved <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend bear in mind that the soviet union are honouring the rules of the helsinki agreement more in the breach <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a good bill <e> <s> i think that it needs and thoroughly deserves the most careful attention <e> <s> i think that it is not right to say that it was skimped or not attended to assiduously in another place <e> <s> admittedly they had hours of discussion and they still had not finished with clause before the guillotine was put on <e> <s> but after the guillotine was applied all the clauses i think possibly with the exception of about six were discussed <e> <s> out of that is a pretty good coverage for a complicated bill <e> <s> i agree that perhaps part v the one dealing with wireless telegraphy was the least discussed and i hope perhaps that we can discuss it rather more deeply in your lordships house when it comes to that part <e>", "<cs> my lords our sources of information differ <e> <s> mine are very respectable and i have no doubt that the noble lords are respectable <e> <s> when my noble friend comes to wind up he may act as an adjudicator <e> <s> he also has good sources <e>", "<cs> my lords international wave lengths are fixed by the international telecommunications union and we are in region which covers the allocation of wave bands in western europe and britain <e> <s> under the rules it is laid down what wave bands should be used <e> <s> i believe that that responsibility should be transferred to oftel under the sponsorship of the department of industry <e> <s> i should like to go further into this question but time does not permit <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me <e> <s> perhaps i did not make it clear that i was in favour of the complete privatisation if that were possible in a short time factor but if the delays were built in and endless wrangles went on two bites of the cherry might be better than no bite at the cherry <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether he knows of any evidence that the warsaw pact countries have asked the soviet union for joint <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend do rather more than look at these fares <e> <s> the british nation and other nations have put up for a very long time with swingeing fares on short hauls to places such as stockholm and denmark even to france and elsewhere <e> <s> it has been rather left to private people sometimes using their own money to campaign for greater fairness and for greater value for money regarding eec air fares <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if the government instead of looking at it took the initiative in trying to introduce fares which were more reasonable compared with world air fares <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to put the matter in perspective and allow us to judge the amount of support behind this question could my noble friend say what is the strength of the sss deployed as compared with the hiroshima weapon allowing for the fact that there are three nuclear warheads in each of the sss deployed by the soviets against western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> i think a point that should be made is why should the government not come in line with what every other free nation already does <e> <s> is there some sin in copying other free economies and therefore advantaging consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord lord rugby and congratulate him on his initiative in having this short debate and also all those other noble lords who have spoken from representative benches <e> <s> we opened with a cross-bencher followed by a labour supporter a liberal supporter another cross-bencher and now i am speaking in favour of some competition from the conservative benches a very natural place from which to make such a plea <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> while throwing distrust on

on the veracity of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do not these encouraging figures confirm and endorse the views of the cbi that our manufacturing economy is now healthily on the move <e>", "<cs> my lords has there not been an encouraging improvement in capital investment <e> <s> therefore would it not be logical that in the coming months and quarters there should be a further increase in productivity as this machinery comes into use <e> <s> would not this further increase our competitiveness in the export markets <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in his original reply he said that there were placed on the bbc two obligations to keep programmes within the law and to maintain programme standards <e> <s> is there not a third obligation to keep a balance in programmes <e> <s> is it not notorious that the panorama team has singularly failed to keep a balance their programmes usually being left-wing and highly anti-american in concept <e>", "<cs> my lords we owe a debt of gratitude to my noble friend lord cathcart for the masterly way in which he started this debate and for the very statesmanlike words with which he introduced it <e> <s> we always enjoy his speeches but i thought that todays effort was one of the very best that i have heard <e> <s> we also owe a debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord chalfont who always puts his finger on the spot and brings back a sense of proportion <e> <s> i agree wholeheartedly with him <e>", "<cs> i support the government on this matter <e> <s> i have had misgivings as probably all of us have about the setting up of a new independent authority and i am worried about the overlapping between this authority and the office of fair trading which has been much quoted by the rrd department of the home office and possibly the new cable authority in certain areas will be overlapping <e> <s> so i think there will be a reshaping and possibly over the next or years a growth in the powers of this authority <e> <s> therefore i would not wish to saddle it at its birth with statutorily-laid-down members two of this two of that and two of the other whom they should consult and who should be sitting on the council and so on <e> <s> i believe we would be much wiser to leave it to the authority as they begin to grow into their responsibilities <e> <s> it is necessary in a high technology industry and in a developing high technology industry which they are going to be responsible for monitoring and policing to some extent to have great flexibility so that the system can develop along the lines that are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say whether the cnd or the voice of cnd in this house as represented by lord jenkins of putney has made any representations to the soviet union about the deployment of its sss <e> <s> is there any evidence that the russians have radically cut down their ss and ss in addition to the sss deployed over the last three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> as he appears to have left the criticism of policy in regard to the small firms ought he not in fairness take account of the fact that every month in the last year new small firms have started up to more than offset in many cases those that have closed down <e> <s> in a fair presentation should not this be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is now a desire by many individuals in britain to do their best to create job opportunities and a demand for our goods <e> <s> it would be very much easier to carry out individual wishes if we were able to discover where goods came from <e> <s> the sooner this is made clear the better for britains recovery in general <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend assure the house just once more not only because the contents of this question have been shown to be false but because press reports have also carried the same innuendoes that the current allegations about the facts surrounding the sinking of the belgrano have absolutely no foundation whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not particularly important that all high technology equipment where conceivably possible should be incorporated and embodied in this aircraft and should come from either britain or her partners <e> <s> is it not sad that carbon fibre which was invented at the royal aircraft establishment at farnborough should be one of the high technology composite materials which we now have to buy from japan one hopes that this is only temporary rather than from sources in the united kingdom the place it was invented <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the new tax rgime is having a healthy effect so that there are more wells being explored and more wells being developed in both oil and gas as a result of the new rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he recall that in the party manifesto and during the election campaign the conservative party made much of its support for regional development and the jobs that would go with that <e> <s> can my noble friend give the house some indication of how much money is currently being spent on regional development and also some indication of whether the government announcement on regional policy is likely to come during the current year or next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask

europe <e> <s> what are the numbers of those who have currently agreed to enter the scheme and train for a year <e> <s> are the government satisfied that the present rate of intake is matching their expectations <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend monitor the results of this scheme <e> <s> if so perhaps parliament can be told after a given time how successful is the scheme and whether those who enter it are more likely to obtain jobs as everyone expects <e> <s> further can my noble friend say whether there are arrangements to adjust the training in order that the maximum usefulness of the training can help provide jobs for these young people <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the late hour and in the interest of brevity i am afraid that i shall have to leave some of the courtesies which are normally expected and very much enjoyed in this house of complimenting noble lords on their speeches particularly the speech of the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> however it would be most wrong not to congratulate my noble and gallant friend lord lewin on his outstanding maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend tell the house when the section the bottleneck that

pickets and their organisers should ensure that in general <e> <s> the number of pickets does not exceed six <e> <s> has he noticed that in the mercury case and other cases the number of pickets has been in hundreds rather than six <e> <s> as many people are trying to reduce tension and because the general atmosphere of industrial relations has improved over the years would he consider now that

question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do not these admirable results indicate that jaguar is a part of the british leyland empire which with its very high quality and fine results would be suitable for early privatisation <e> <s> can my noble friend say when this is likely to come about and when it does come about will he make sure that those who work for jaguar as

people <e> <s> i asked in my first supplementary question whether the employees and all who work for jaguar would be given an opportunity of buying not receiving free shares in the future of this great enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend understand how pleased we on this side of the house are to hear that this very ambitious programme is contemplated and noble lords in other parts of the house as well <e> <s> could he note that when these operations are undertaken every effort is made to involve those who are working in the industries concerned <e> <s> is it not a fact that the national freight corporation where management and workpeople were all concerned and bought shares is likely not just to break even as it did last year but to make profits of about million this year <e> <s> is it not also true that nationalisation does not in fact guarantee the same jobs to the same people <e> <s> there were very large cuts in the nationalised industries of gas and electricity in the years before this government came to power <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that

congratulations to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who opened this debate <e> <s> for us all wherever we sit in the house that was a speech that was such a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that

short as my noble friend who has just sat down did <e> <s> i should like to take up one small point made by the noble lord lord howard <e> <s> he gave some rather horrifying and costly details of the ambitious schemes that i presume the bbc might wish to install <e> <s> it should be said that it would be a job for the committee to consider alternative schemes and possibly to ask for alternative tenders <e> <s> there may be other bodies such as channel which might be able to fulfil the task much less expensively <e> <s> i do not wish the figures mentioned by the noble lord to be carved in tablets of stone and possibly accepted as being the best quote <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether i am not right in thinking that the broadcasting complaints commission deals with individuals who may feel that they have been wronged individual complaints not to do with either balance or distortion or with any of the other evils that might arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> it seems to me that it is realistic to plan for cable and not to allow western europe to go its own way as it has been doing for many years as have the usa canada and other countries

off if they do not like the amount of advertising and they will not subscribe again so that you are killing the market in which you have invested a lot of money to serve <e> <s> it seems to be that

there is a band there and over-reservation has beer made <e> <s> there is the private maritime band where some frequencies are available <e> <s> in any case it is surely logical to say that as bt

property for which other people are having to pay <e>", "<cs> as honorary secretary of the group perhaps i could intervene very briefly <e>", "<cs> yes i was late on parade but having heard three labour front bench spokesmen on the previous amendment i imagined that that would be repeated for the rest of the amendments <e> <s> i was wrong and am delighted that i was wrong <e>", "<cs> before my

my noble friend bear in mind that this amendment was passed at am this morning in another place and that that shows a sense of urgency and dedication to duty of all those concerned well above any standards we normally set <e> <s> could the same expedition now be given to perhaps republishing the draft licence so that we could consider that with rather more time than we have had to consider these amendments <e> <s> perhaps we might even have the discussion paper on bands and which we are still waiting for <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider whether the description of us cruise missile is an accurate one <e> <s> would it not be more accurate to say on the order paper cruise missiles deployed on united kingdom bases as a result of natos request to the usa <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take an opportunity some time of pointing out that coal mining areas all over the world have to close mines as they become redundant or uneconomic and that the last labour government in this country closed pits so the proposal to close pits is not a very substantial blow against the industry <e> <s> is not the proposal made in a desire to make the industry more economic and competitive and is that desire not backed up by the huge investment of nearly million each year in order to make the pits modern efficient and competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say what would have happened to the vote if those conservative peers who attend less than per cent <e> <s> of our sittings to which this question refers had not come at all <e> <s> secondly if my noble friend had been the chief whip of the labour party would he not have been a little disturbed that whereas the alliance party voted the whole of the labour party voted only on this very special occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that information <e> <s> is it not a fact then that in the labour governments time from to pits were closed which was an average of a year <e> <s> and was that not also the time when at the ministry of power mr wedgwood benn was the minister in charge <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in putting down this question i was anxious that the rest of the nation should hear some of the facts which are not readily available in that pit closures have long been a problem in every nation that produces coal as pits are worked out <e> <s> this is nothing new <e> <s> but as this has been made the excuse by mr scargill for disrupting our industrial progress in this country is it not a fact that we are trying to be as generous as we can about closures that even a relatively young miner will get more than compensation and that all redundancies up to date and even this year have been voluntary <e> <s> it is not widely known that they are voluntary redundancies <e> <s> also offers of jobs in mines nearby are being conscientiously made to those who suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that in the panorama programme of th april a senior argentine admiral when asked if he would have taken this action said if i had been responsible for the british forces and their safety i should certainly have taken exactly the same action <e>", "<cs> my lords has my friend noticed and one would not wish to blame his department that in this day of the computer when delays are measured in nano-seconds it is rather surprising that the latest set of figures in this instance applies to and here we are nearly halfway through <e> <s> this is the case time and time again when statistics are sought <e> <s> will he raise this matter with the central government department and say that it is no use investing in computers if they are utterly unable to give parliament more up-to-date figures than are presently available <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider doing an investigation to see what happened to the miners when mines were closed every year during the last labour government <e> <s> have they been redeployed in new industries <e> <s> if there is any doubt and if we could help as a government would my noble friend set up an arrangement whereby retraining is possible so that every possible facility could be offered and every goodwill shown to redeploy people who want retraining in the area where they live <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for the statement and welcoming the fact that it is put before both houses before there is a firm action and fact may i say that i have some reservations <e> <s> both these companies are deeply involved in defence <e> <s> the defence white paper makes the clear point that it is government policy to try to encourage competition and thereby lower the price of equipment which they are buying and which plays such a large part in the defence budget <e> <s> on the face of it <e> <s> this would seem to reduce competition in the avionics field <e> <s> can my noble friend make sure that the five or six very large electronic companies are going to compete on a fair basis if emi is absorbed by british aerospace <e> <s> that is a very big absorption with probably over billion in market value altogether <e> <s> on such a big issue and with the reduction of competition probable would it not be wise to consider referring this matter to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very good piece of news <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not this has come about because british leyland has entirely re-formed itself in recent years and now has better designs

leyland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way early in this debate because it is desirable <e> <s> many of us have

have been a welcome addition and we are all sorry that he is not here for this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not think that i criticised the bma <e> <s> i said that the matter had not come before

at all <e> <s> what becomes of that argument if we are told that over years they have been in correspondence and have been carefully exercising their minds with the minister of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i still think that it is important that specialist committees should at least meet when an important bill is published <e> <s> they have never met since this bill was published <e> <s> i get the feeling and this may apply to others who speak in this debate that some do not know what is in the bill <e>", "<cs> and an x-ray and everything else <e> <s> why do you suppose that they have allowed freedom and why in those markets are spectacles so much more easily and cheaply available particularly for those who through perfectly normal ageing processes <e> <s> need some help in reading <e> <s>

more flexible than people hitherto thought <e> <s> you can make an allowance <e> <s> my eyes are slightly different but there is an extreme adaptability <e> <s> in the states incidentally they are doing research because they find that bifocal lenses sometimes cause accidents in that people stumble over a step because they are not looking through the right part of the lens <e> <s> they now find that it is perfectly possible in some cases i am not advocating this but it reflects the differences in how adaptable are our eyes to have the lens in one eye for reading and in the other eye for more distant vision <e> <s> the adaptability of our eyes and our brain is so great that one can allow for it <e> <s> where there is a minor difference it is perfectly acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that these figures are very encouraging for all those concerned in the british leyland enterprise <e> <s> they show that the vast investment that the taxpayer and the government have put in is paying off in increased productivity not least because there are now much better industrial relations and better co-operation on the production line <e> <s> will this continue so that british leyland can regather some of the market both here and overseas <e> <s> if my noble friend

which will be of tremendous benefit for everybody who needs reading glasses <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that before he sat down the noble lord was going to draw the conclusion about the massive build-up of chemical weapons by the soviets <e> <s> surely the conclusion is that one should not disarm unilaterally in any field <e> <s> in we disarmed unilaterally in chemical weapons <e> <s> we destroyed ours we sunk them at sea we stopped in the hope that this would set the example which we are always quoted and that other people would follow suit <e> <s> this has not been the case <e> <s> the soviets have doubled and redoubled their chemical warfare efforts and this is a real threat to the alliance as they now stand <e> <s> i was not altogether certain that a conference of non-aligned

truly effective it would need more people and more money <e> <s> we are delighted that the government and the new director general have thought fit to try to strengthen it <e> <s> may i add that one hopes that perhaps the calibre of the people will be exceptionally good so that they can carry out their very difficult and extensive duties in keeping a monopoly which has per cent <e> <s> of the

paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the house must be very grateful that these quite amazing figures have emerged from this question <e> <s> a sum of million to help the

for refuse and street cleaning not one of the councils concerned is under labour control <e> <s> why should both ratepayers and taxpayers in all the areas where labour councils preside suffer as a result of this political dogma <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support what the noble lord lord northfield said in very brief remarks because he made out his case so well as did my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne and others and it would be a mistake to lengthen my remarks <e> <s> however i have been wondering ever since this bill came forward and i began to look at the history of it for the past years why it is that we alone have set up this cumbersome and very expensive system at the end of which many people in this country pay for a pair of reading spectacles <e> <s> people in other countries which have not set up this system are just as careful about the medical condition of their eyes <e> <s> the majority of states in the usa and japan both those huge nations where they do sometimes suffer from poor eyesight have found it perfectly satisfactory not to set up the system which we set up years ago <e> <s> i wonder why the government have taken such a tentative tiny step forward towards liberty after years of trial after seeing the difference between costs here and those in oveseas countries where greater liberty exists <e> <s> i cannot help feeling it is because there are enormous profits sloshing around in the present system <e>", "<cs> subsidised my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether there is a distinct barrier as between english language students and tourists <e> <s> is it right that nearly a million people came to study the english language and that some of these like the libyans have stayed on first as tourists and then

is a licence for years <e> <s> originally it was not going to be discussed and then as your lordships will remember this house had one of its minor revolutions of <e> <s> on that occasion it was led

spirit of co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene does he recall that the independent carter report looked at this very carefully <e> <s> they recommended that

approaches the question of competition on the short-haul routes in an effort i hope to bring down the prices which are at an incredible height at the present will he also perhaps consider whether the pooling arrangement which has been there for far too long is in the interests of the customer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my

points raised earlier in the debate <e> <s> i am surprised to find myself in this position and i think that this is the only subject on which i differ from the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> i feel

grandparents and others who are deeply disturbed at the way political control and ultra-political indoctrination are going on in our schools <e> <s> that is not just thought up <e> <s> what is sad is that ministers still do not seem to have got this message <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> at least we are pushing at a door that has a chink of it open <e> <s> i and my noble friends would like to consider the regulations as they now stand to see whether they are in a form sufficiently detailed to cover the points that we have made in these short speeches provided that my noble friend the minister will press on in the meantime <e> <s> if this is delayed there may be time if not at report perhaps at third reading to see whether it is necessary to press again an amendment <e> <s> in the meantime we shall study the regulations and come back to my noble friend should we not be happy with his assurances <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord would not wish to say that open cities were bombed <e> <s> mr heath made this same remark and it was absolutely inaccurate <e> <s> there were five pinpoint targets picked out and hit in tripoli and some bombers came back without releasing their bombs because they could not be sure of hitting those targets <e> <s> the open city of tripoli was not bombed <e>", "<cs> my lords the main difference of opinion in this debate and in the country is over whether the prime minister should have said yes or no <e> <s> she said yes and the words reported at col in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> that is right the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones will be replying <e> <s> perhaps when he answers he will be able to withdraw what the noble lord lord cledwyn said <e> <s> lord cledwyn talked about bombing an open city <e> <s> it was not bombing of an open city <e> <s> i do not know much about international law but i know that an open city is one that declares itself to be open and is not armed <e> <s> there are myriads of sam s around tripoli and libya can deploy mig s and s <e> <s> it was not an open city nor was it bombing <e> <s> it was pinpoint bombing of specific targets <e> <s> we shall only encourage anti-americanism if we do not soon nail that misrepresentation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many empty houses there were in the glc when that organisation died <e> <s> are the successor authorities the local authorities now picking up those empty properties and turning them into lettable properties and therefore employing them more usefully <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that with libyans in this country it seems a little perplexing that only are thought to be in any way a risk to this countrys security <e> <s> will he examine this with care <e> <s> will he be as forthcoming on information as is conceivably possible <e> <s> we have had an example in the past week where in the absence of instant information from american or british sources colonel gaddafi has made all the running produced all the photographs and all the propaganda for the free and non-free world <e> <s> we saw an example last night in pictures of anti-personnel bombs which were said to come from f-s <e> <s> f-s leaving this country never had any anti-personnel bombs <e> <s> this was a pure invention <e> <s> and many other stories are circulating <e> <s> we must be forthcoming if we are to fill the vacuum of interest which the media expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those of other noble lords for the manner in which the noble baroness lady faithfull introduced this interesting and important subject <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on the police and make one or two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> i do not know who implemented it <e> <s> it was in our manifesto <e> <s> the report was to hand <e> <s> we were in a position to put it into action straightaway as we did <e> <s> i think that we took the right course and we did it on the platform upon which we had been elected <e> <s> the point that i am making is that we lost some valuable people and years later the police are to some extent missing the middle management that those people would now have provided <e> <s> i think that is sad <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend assure the house that he will continue to consider all conceivable new ways of creating jobs <e> <s> as one who saw that programme i thought that what was remarkable was that it seemed to please the person concerned his family and the community <e> <s> above all it was safeguarding the position of the trade unions and therefore was supported by them <e> <s> will he bear that in mind if as i hope will happen he starts a test programme in one or two places in this country to see how it fares under the different conditions here <e>", "<cs> my noble friend on the front bench has been more sympathetic <e> <s> my noble friend lord butterworth asked what is the object of the amendment <e> <s> the object is to take the opportunity of legislation passing through parliament to strengthen the hand of those whose hands are at the moment too flabby and too irresolute <e> <s> my noble friend lady cox so correctly quoted the instance of guildford college of law which found it impossible to allow a law officer of the crown sir patrick mayhew to talk to the students because it might cause trouble <e> <s> surely we need to strengthen the hands of those who are flabby <e> <s> what about the case where douglas hurd who after all is secretary of state at the home office wished to address kings college and a large gang of thugs turned up from the lse not too far away and prevented him from entering the meeting itself proceeded to chant slogans outside and pelted him and conservative students with eggs when they attempted to leave the building <e> <s> clearly something needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply can he be a little more specific <e> <s> recently i read in the papers that million was saved in the first six months by competitive contracts <e> <s> therefore is it true that we are likely to save million in the year <e> <s> is that the sort of aim which the government are hoping to achieve in the present year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very satisfactory reply <e> <s> can he enlarge upon it and say how soon the public will receive details of the personal equity plan <e> <s> can he say on what basis the recent national opinion poll was taken which showed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think most of us would wish to congratulate my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on a masterly introductory speech <e> <s> it was full not only of good knowledge and good sense but good humour as well and it set us off on what i think has been a most admirable debate <e> <s> i think i am appointed in this position rather as a sweeper <e> <s> those of you who watched the cup final will know that the sweeper is behind the stars picking up the odd ball here and there and making sure it is not too dangerous to his own side <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i was a wicket keeper but i gave that up a few years ago <e> <s> i wanted to pick up some of the points which have not been covered very fully and perhaps to touch on others and enlarge on them <e> <s> i wanted to cover four points <e> <s> the first concerns the lights <e> <s> i was honoured to be the chairman of the sub-committee and i should like to say a word on that <e> <s> secondly i should like to touch on what the rest of the world has done because sometimes we seem to live on this island as a sort of closed circuit we do not look sufficiently outside this island to see what is going on when parliaments are televised elsewhere <e> <s> i also want to say a word on editorial control and lastly a word about the future <e>", "<cs> my lords when may we expect facts and figures of a constructive nature about tackling this problem from the opposition who only criticise <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that sometimes the french build small ships which they hope to sell to third world countries for coastal defence purposes and if they do not sell them they absorb them into the french navy <e> <s> if they sell them it helps to retain an element of shipbuilding in france in this very difficult market <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to praise the government for having accepted this amendment <e> <s> we raised this matter at committee stage and over the three months that we have been negotiating with the government it is nice that they have been able to find some solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell us how many people the new agency currently employs and in particular how many are fully qualified engineers <e> <s> is it not a fact that the british are the prime contractors in every european communications satellite <e> <s> should we not give our achievements rather more publicity to try to match the publicity which the french receive for their more modest ones <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell us about the funding of the new agency <e> <s> how much extra is committed to it and from where does it draw its funds <e> <s> does it come within the dti vote or from where does it come <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend draw the commissioners attention to the advantage of now recruiting more special constables <e> <s> is it not sad that the strength of our special constabulary has fallen to but per cent <e> <s> of what it was five years ago <e> <s> would the special constables not only build a bridge of understanding between the police and local communities but also help to off-load some of the responsibilities which police officers could well share with the special reservists <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the facts he has given can my noble friend say how much money <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many jobs have been created by this desirable activity <e> <s> in view of the very popular and somewhat overcrowded chelsea flower show on the understanding that already a quarter of a million people have already attended this festival is there not something to be said for repeating this idea again in <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister consider whether since this review may take some time and the resulting action further time the mmc and the office of fair trading are rather overloaded with the present spate <e> <s> will he examine whether they need a stronger staff or more power for them to carry out expeditiously the very important work they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that the general impression given certainly on the television and in the press is that very very few of the vehicles would pass an mot test many of them probably are not road licensed and others may not carry the compulsory third party insurance <e> <s> surely action can be taken on these issues straight away by the police <e> <s> will my noble friend also bear in mind that most of us in this house used to see notices scattered around the countryside saying trespassers <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is very welcome news that the government are to grasp this nettle of the rent act <e> <s> will he bear in mind when framing the legislation the very admirable report by his royal highness the duke of edinburgh and the admirable debate we had in this house from which many good lessons emerged which could be incorporated in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that answer but i am afraid that in those circumstances i cannot <e> <s> it is clear from the literature on tourist coaches in london that the government are taking this seriously but i wonder whether they realise the urgency <e> <s> we are progressively reducing the traffic of london to chaos with more and more coaches coming in <e> <s> with million overseas visitors london has a greater problem than any other city in the world <e> <s> therefore should not coaches be staggered <e> <s> at the moment the peak in the morning is considerable being five times that for the afternoon <e> <s> should not coaches be staggered in days <e> <s> should not school coaches be allowed to come into london only in the afternoons rather than the mornings <e> <s> does not my noble friend agree that those methods should be used in controlling coaches and therefore lessen the problems which currently abound <e>", "<cs> my lords following up the point that my noble friend does not have any evidence or information on what other capital cities are doing can he perhaps send telexes to our numerous diplomatic representatives in those capital cities to ascertain how other people are tackling this problem <e> <s> will he also consider as he is already using the mall for coach parking at certain times the possible use of horse guards parade in the mornings to overcome some of the congestion which is currently self-evident <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend go a little further and say that this pack is so monstrous that it should be withdrawn <e> <s> it is not a question of not issuing any more <e> <s> if you have sinned and been found out you should be redeemed by withdrawing all the copies which now exists in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not remarkable that an industry has signed a succession of voluntary agreements seriously curtailing its sales <e> <s> is it not remarkable that it spends money from its own resources on discouraging the young smoker <e> <s> is it not perhaps up to improved discipline in the schools by those who have a responsibility for discipline to stop very young people smoking in the schools as is currently being done <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends earlier remarks implied that our diplomatic represent-atives are not very closely in touch with these men <e> <s> can she say whether they are regularly visited and whether their families are regularly visited <e> <s> is their situation unique or given the intention of dr mugabe to form a one-party state are other people being detained without trial and kept in prison <e> <s> surely our diplomatic representatives ought to be in close touch with those problems and reporting back so that this house and another place know what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend with her right honourable and learned friend and mine too the foreign secretary remind the foreign secretary of the soviet union that we unilaterally destroyed our stocks of chemical weapons at the end of the s that the united states ceased to produce <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend draw to the attention of the soviet government the admirable foreign affairs debate that we had in this house last friday and in particular the speech by the noble lord lord chalfont in which he drew attention to the amount of training that the soviet union is giving bright anc members in violent acts of terrorism and the encouragement that it is giving to southern africa in the troubles now going on there <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us how the scheme to charge people who are doing repairs to motorways according to the number and extent of lane closures is working out <e> <s> could he bear in mind that there is still a desire to cone off miles and miles of carriageway particularly in the fast lane and that then after travelling five miles you find just one vehicle renewing a light <e> <s> is this really economical use of very expensive carriageway <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the imports have been rising very steeply in recent years that the figure was one-half of per cent <e> <s> imported some years ago and that it is now nearer per cent <e> <s> has the manning of the laboratories been sufficient to match that <e> <s> i ask that because there are indications that large numbers of the cheaper type with the higher tar content are now coming in and are not being properly monitored by the government laboratories <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand my noble friend rightly when she claimed that per cent <e> <s> of brands selling more than million a year in this country are now being tested <e> <s> can she assure me that the tar content appears on those packs and are the health warnings as required by statute also on those packs <e> <s> perhaps she can also tell us whether the overseas people are keeping in line so that there is a steady reduction in tar content to meet the aim of milligrams by december <e> <s> is that also being monitored <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house what percentage of schools are carrying out the statutory act of worship <e> <s> is it not a fact now that about half the schools are positively disobeying the law and are not carrying out these acts of worship <e> <s> can my noble friend also perhaps say what is the right route for a parent to take if she objects to a negligible act of worship in schools and to there being no religious teaching at all <e> <s> does she complain to the school <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether maritime aircraft deployed in the area are keeping a careful survey of the ships being deployed in fishing not only outside the exclusion zone but inside the zone <e> <s> is this not preparatory to showing how outrageous it is that everyone is now poaching fish in this area to the great disadvantage of the future fish stocks of that zone <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the postal service is steadily going down in punctuality of its delivery <e> <s> it is steadily being automated we hope in order to reduce the costs <e> <s> convenient sub-post offices are being closed and crown post offices are rare and far between <e> <s> that represents a further depreciation of the service that the public receives <e> <s> surely it is now time that more wholesale automation should take place and that there should be a deep anxiety by the post office to make their deliveries more punctual and efficient so that they match the needs of a modern industrial economy <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider publishing a list which shows those diplomatic missions who have made a marked improvement and equally those diplomatic missions who are still recalcitrant in this manner and seem to take no account of the inconveniences and law-breaking caused by their diplomats <e> <s> would not a list of this sort be quite salutary and probably be of greater effect than any answers given in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the agenda includes items such as the elimination of weapons in space presumably that means the sdi but not russian anti-missiles the removal of all foreign military bases and the dissolution of military <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the public order bill will help to strengthen the powers against these practices and if so will the government make sure that the clause dealing with these powers is brought into effect at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in his earlier response my noble friend said that people had been convicted <e> <s> can he tell us what the penalties were for those people <e> <s> were they sufficient to discourage the continuation of those unseemly rows at wapping night after night month after month <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend bear in mind that there has been no move particularly from labour party sources to restrict the rent act <e> <s> if the rent act was eased somewhat there would be fewer people clamouring to buy their houses and many more moving into rentable accommodation which must be made available by this government as soon as conceivably possible <e> <s> no other party has ever backed any change of any consequence in the rent acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i support the idea that we should expand our overseas services <e> <s> it is clear that the foreign office is monitoring expenditure of million and that we are getting reasonable value for money <e> <s> however are we sure that the content is representative of the broad view of britain <e> <s> does my noble friend recall that in it was discovered that khomeinis students in this country were providing broadcasting tapes in farsi and that no one in the bbc in control of these had any idea what was being broadcast <e> <s> it was discovered that they were being broadcast to unseat the shah and promote khomeinis interests <e> <s> has that matter now been put right or ought perhaps an independent body see that we are broadcasting to the world at large a true representation of what is happening in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that since this question went down i have had <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will continue to press the matter of the diplomatic bags <e> <s> it is a very long time now since this was discovered <e> <s> i think i remember reading perhaps not in this specific case that the syrian airlines had been widely used for the import of arms and explosives <e> <s> surely there is nothing against x-raying a diplomatic bag <e> <s> it is the papers which are valuable and secret <e> <s> if there are arms in those bags they will be very quickly shown up <e> <s> surely this is a matter which could be pressed with the ec as well so that we can universally take action against those countries which are harbouring and training terrorists <e> <s> there are people who say that the actions which the ec and ourselves have already agreed and the further actions which we hope may be agreed on th november are anti-arab <e> <s> can my noble friend say what possible evidence there is in any way to support that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are now some nuclear power stations in the world <e> <s> is it not a fact that the casualties arising from these are fewer than one-hundredth of the tragic casualties that arise from people who continue to mine coal <e> <s> will my noble friend bear in mind that if our own nuclear power stations are progressively closed down we will be able to rely on the french supply by the cable across the channel where the french are expanding their nuclear power stations and producing electricity very much more cheaply as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there appears among young people to be a greater prevalence of hay fever asthma and even heart disease <e> <s> does she agree that anything which can watch over this and perhaps improve the general health of young people is to be praised and encouraged <e> <s> if this experiment in essex is successful will the government draw the attention of the local authorities and of the teacher training colleges to its success and therefore help promote it <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed since his promotion to the front bench and taking up his effective ministerial responsibilities that whenever we ask for statistics in this house the time taken to get them together gets longer and longer while computers get faster and faster <e> <s> why are the latest available figures for in an area where the technique is advancing so fast <e> <s> we want up-to-date figures not figures that are three years old or even one year old <e> <s> should it not be possible to have in every field of government more accurate information in areas where decisions are currently being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say where one could obtain a list of the results of past sanctions and these sanctions to see whether they are being effective and are producing some results <e> <s> for instance in this country we read nothing about the degree of mixed sports which now take place on a very wide basis <e> <s> we read nothing of the way in which some action has already been taken to lessen the severity of the well-despised and disliked methods of apartheid <e> <s> we read nothing about any changes <e> <s> is there any way by which we can measure what is happening as a result of the actions taken by the ec and ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what is the life of the operational nuclear power stations around the world and what is likely to be the life of the over nuclear power stations currently being constructed <e> <s> how does that life compare with the life of our own magnox <e> <s> is it greater or is it less <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a point that we want to clarify <e> <s> does the noble lord recognise that if he is to cancel trident he will have to meet very large costs <e> <s> by how much will he increase the conventional strength <e> <s> if it is by per cent <e> <s> it will cost an extra million in military salaries alone without equipping the extra troops <e> <s> how can he balance the budget and say that defence expenditure will stay exactly the same despite the cancellation and despite extra conventional forces <e> <s> how will he do that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the french have a bigger nuclear deterrent force than we have <e> <s> is it not also true that present plans for our nuclear deterrent depend on having one operational ballistic missile nuclear submarine at sea <e> <s> is it not rather difficult even in the eyes of the sdp to have half an operational submarine at sea <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that willesden college was at the edge of my constituency and has <e>", "<cs> my lords i said was not is <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that the college has had a high reputation for a long time and that mr powell with his years of service there has made a notable contribution to that reputation <e> <s> is she also aware that the habit of hard left councils taking such action is spreading and has recently occurred in nottingham <e> <s> in view of an education bill coming before this house after it has been through another place is there a possibility that a provision could be added to it to discourage and prevent such occurrences <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord willis will not leave because i am going to deal with some the points

criticism <e> <s> i see nothing wrong in being a critic <e> <s> i do not understand why it should immediately be said that there was an immense attack upon the whole editorial freedom of the bbc <e>

juncture to inhibit the development in the united kingdom by laying down firm rules and regulations concerning what can and cannot be done <e> <s> the choice must lie with the viewers <e> <s> if there is too much advertising they will not look at it and the people who are propagating that idea will obtain the answer quickly from that source <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind the

establishment that has been given <e> <s> has there been any improvement in the processing of applicants <e> <s> the house was recently told of the very long wait that people experience before learning whether or not they are accepted <e> <s> has there been an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised a second point which my noble friend has overlooked <e> <s> are the applicants being more rapidly processed than they were <e> <s> it was taking over six months to let an applicant know whether he or she had been accepted <e> <s> has that position been improved upon <e>", "<cs> my lords in the figures that he gave us for the breakdown of exports can my noble friend say what part is played by aircraft parts and more particularly aircraft engines <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that for a decade soviet scientists have been deploying their version of sdi that is to say the interception of missiles by missiles <e> <s> if that achieves the results that they intend is it not wise to have extra capacity so that with trident we can afford to choose as between decoys and nuclear warheads <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to congratulate another maiden speaker on a

hope to hear him again very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not looked behind the scenes it is bad enough to unravel our own accounts in this country without having to try to unravel the french ones as well <e> <s> the noble lord may have a good point but the fact is that they have undertaken projects and they are now aiming to have these fast trains going to the south-west to bordeaux <e>

encouraging that the two broadcasting and television organisations should co-operate in getting the message across <e> <s> however is it not a little disastrous that they should include spitting image
