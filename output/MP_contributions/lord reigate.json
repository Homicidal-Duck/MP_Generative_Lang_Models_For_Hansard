["<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that in fact the role of the neb had nothing to do with the question asked by my noble friend which is entirely a matter of carrying out a recommendation of a committee of the house of commons <e>", "<cs> since opinions have been called for i should like to support the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> it has the merit of being rather a briefer title <e> <s> i hope i shall not be thought too flippant if i say that if there is to be an office for the fund the telephone operator will have to answer in a bright voice every time national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> it is a little flippant but it is a practical point <e> <s> we all know that it will be known as the heritage fund eventually and therefore i think the nearer we get to that the better <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am very disappointed in my noble friends reply <e> <s> it is exactly what i thought i would get <e> <s> i could have written the speech for him and if i may say so i think i would have written it better <e> <s> my noble friend entirely missed the point <e> <s> we all know perfectly well that the recommendations will be put forward by one minister or the other <e> <s> i foresee certain difficulties with regard to co-operation <e> <s> the sort of dialogue i am frightened of is one minister saying to the other look here i appointed your friend lord snodgrass last time <e> <s> i think it is time you let me have a go <e> <s> i want to appoint sir simeon stylites who is a great expert <e> <s> these matters are sorted out as we all know behind the scenes <e>", "<cs> i am quite prepared to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the minister would be the recipient of many attacks from his colleagues if he did not mention england and scotland <e> <s> did he have any attacks from the home secretary for not referring to the channel islands and the isle of man which are also part of the united kingdom or territorial appendages <e> <s> i just wanted to object to the rather woolly wording and in any way trying to fetter or tie the hands of the ministers in this matter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will agree that it is the most awfully woolly wording <e> <s> it does as i really think it should do give the ministers a pretty free hand <e> <s> if the minister wanted to i suppose he could appoint a manxman who had a bank account in scotland or london <e> <s> i just put this up <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend would be able to defend it but to me it is bad law making <e>", "<cs> it does not say they will get one each <e> <s> if that is what they agreed to they have been had for mugs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson for intervening and making some sense out of what i thought was going to result in absolute chaos <e> <s> i had no intention of pressing the amendment to a division my noble friend will be glad to hear but we have done <e>", "<cs> would it help my noble friend if he found the opportunity to insert somewhere the words or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my noble friend galloped through his remarks on my amendment with such speed and fervour that i am not sure that i took the purport of all his remarks on board <e> <s> therefore i propose to withdraw my amendment and i hope that we might return to the battle in some form or another on a further occasion <e>", "<cs> it is very important that every voice possible should be registered from these benches in support of the principle of this amendment <e> <s> it is permissive <e> <s> i accept that present circumstances are unfavourable but there is nothing to stop the minister saying to an appointee i do not propose to give you the emoluments that i could give <e> <s> that is perfectly all right <e> <s> the other arguments are absolutely valid <e> <s> i must also say that i think it is rather surprising that something which was agreed by a committee upstairs should be reversed <e> <s> i think that we ought to go back to that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so surprised by what has happened that even my noble friend could have knocked me down with a feather <e> <s> i of course choose amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was very much a second best and i can think of a lot of arguments against it <e> <s> i am delighted that in the face of this unanimous feeling my noble friend has been so generous as to agree <e> <s> i have here pages of abuse which i should have poured upon his head if he had not done so but i am now able very happily to tear up all my notes <e>", "<cs> my lords does this mean that in another place the government will accept our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that could cause delay <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was the black sheep on the last occasion and voted with the opposition on the amendment which they proposed i should like to express once again my regret that her majestys government are not prepared to accept this amendment which is even less permissive than the last one <e> <s> if a proposal was brought forward under the resolution i should vote against it <e> <s> it will he quite unnecessary for a very long time to come to find someone suitable who needs to be paid if one may put it in that way without being too discourteous <e> <s> so it seems to me as statutes are usually designed for all time that you may just as well have this power <e> <s> i hope that it will not be used for some time but at least if there was a change of circumstances the power would be there <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has been kind enough to give me some elucidation of what he was about to say <e> <s> the issue seems to be a fairly simple one <e> <s> i thought that on the report stage the amendment which i put forward met the sentiments of all sides of the house and provided the fund with what might be termed a convenient short corporate name under which it could act and have its being <e> <s> afterwards it was pointed out to me that i had made a technical error in not referring to it as theheritage fundthroughout the bill and all my amendments are consequential on the fact that it is clearer to refer to it as theheritage fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that this is totally illogical and unnecessary <e> <s> my noble friend will have noticed that clause says who the ministers are <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will forgive me if i elect to say a very few words at this stage of the bill <e> <s> it has in my view been greatly improved during its journey through this house <e> <s> it is an admirable bill <e> <s> to me the nub of the bill is and always has been in the independence of the trustees <e> <s> this really in a way was the mistake of hugh dalton when he first initiated the land fund <e> <s> if there had been trustees then what happened in would never have occurred what has happened since then would not have occurred and we should have seen this fund a flourishing and established part of the law of the land <e> <s> i must admit that when i first introduced the national land fund bill as it was then called i was deeply moved by the trauma that the noble baroness lady birk was suffering on the subject of mentmore and <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may recall that on the report stage i tabled two amendments <e> <s> one concerned whether the appointment of the trustees should be in the hands of the crown as advised by the prime minister or alternatively made by the prime minister <e> <s> when faced with the generous capitulation of my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton i had to choose between one of those two and i apparently chose the wrong one namely the first one <e> <s> however i must say at once that i am perfectly happy to agree with what the commons have chosen to do and i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of the reasons for so doing reasons which having studied <e>", "<cs> my lord is my noble friend aware that with great respect his earlier answer does not make very much sense <e> <s> first is he aware of the very large sum of money that has been spent on westminster hospital in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend accept that the issue raised that of the better allocation of the resources for medicine and teaching in london would not justify a bad decision such as that which is put forward <e>", "<cs> i suppose that i must in all courtesy say to my noble friend that i am most grateful for his reply which was not unexpected <e> <s> i am a little surprised that there was not a single voice from the opposition benches liberal or labour in view of the interest they have always displayed in this matter in the past <e> <s> i accept the validity of my noble friends arguments although i regret that he cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the flowers <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that the introduction of a large element of competition is thoroughly to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noted a recent speech by the secretary of state for social services in which he said it was still the governments target to recruit doctors a year but that that target had not yet been achieved <e> <s> in these circumstances does it make any sense to close a medical school which is producing doctors a year at low cost and with very high academic standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for detaining your lordships but i can assure your lordships that i shall be brief <e> <s> in particular i apologise for the fact that my name is not on the list of speakers but i had not anticipated that this debate would come on as early as it has come on <e> <s> i wish to support my noble friends lord nugent of guildford and lord onslow in their protest but first i should like to congratulate my noble friend and my old friend lord aberconway <e> <s> i was going to say my noble old friend but that does not sound quite right so he will have to be my friend twice over <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether by the time the reorganisation is complete there will be more or fewer posts than there were before the last reorganisation in <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord alport in his enterprise <e> <s> i have known the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether we shall now have full diplomatic representation in guatemala and <e>", "<cs> my lords will this review cover the conditions and the equipment used by other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on having shown a degree of persistence in again bringing forward the bill a slightly different bill from that which he brought forward last year <e> <s> i supported him last time and i shall support him again this time in i hope the division lobby <e> <s> if he is slightly despondent at having to go through this more than once he can take some comfort from my own experience when i introduced the bill to establish what is now known as the national heritage fund <e> <s> it was rejected twice by governments it was subsequently adopted by a government which gave i thought singularly little credit to your lordships house for its initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by congratulating the noble lord lord strathalmond on his able and remarkable speech <e> <s> may i also take the opportunity of saying to my noble friend lord windlesham that listening to his cogent exposition i began to get a far clearer idea of what the bill was about than i have had in my mind for the last two years <e> <s> three in a row i also declare my interest as being what used to be called a name at lloyds but what is now i am afraid going to be referred to by the rather ugly phrase external member which rather puts one outside the pale in a horrible way <e>", "<cs> i must make it clear my lords that i am not a lawyer or a working member of lloyds and i disown any expert knowledge of lloyds <e> <s> i have heard from lloyds only as one who from time to time has drawn a nice cheque from lloyds <e> <s> i would not want to answer my noble friends question off the cuff <e> <s> frankly from my exeprience and from what i have heard discussed i should have thought that the sasse situation could have been nipped in the bud much earlier if they had had the immunity clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> i only want to stop this rather wandering on to this butcher thing <e> <s> i live in a neighbourhood with five food shops open within five minutes walk and not a single butcher open within minutes walk on a sunday morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to be fairly brief <e> <s> i think that i am the first noble lord to have spoken in this debate who has to declare an interest as an external member of lloyds or what i choose to call a name <e> <s> i should first like to add my thanks to the select committee for so well completing their mammoth task <e> <s> nineteen days is a long stint and i speak with all the sympathy of one who has just surfaced from a select committee which sat for a mere eight or nine days <e> <s> but in our case they included which they were lucky not to have a cold wet tramp around epsom downs and walton downs <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has the answer could he consider telling us about the m <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak very mildly indeed in favour of the amendment <e> <s> there is good reason for it in the light of what the noble lord lord strabolgi has said <e> <s> on the other hand it goes against the grain a little to see it in a statute <e> <s> i think that we should trust the appointing body the person or whoever it is to have some regard to ensure that there is not too much plurality of appointment inside this particular sphere <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment albeit with some reluctance because i think that the day of the intelligent amateur is not yet finished <e> <s> however i recognise that if we are to get the type of person we want for these boards we shall have to pay them <e> <s> we live in a different age from the age of some of the trustees who were discussed at an earlier stage in our debates <e> <s> i would only add that as to any money which is paid it should be made known whether it is remuneration or allowances <e> <s> i suggest that the right vehicle is the annual report which most <e>", "<cs> may i make one or two comments <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and also to the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu i included at the end of the amendment the words <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am entirely convinced by what my noble friend has said but i will read his comments and see what conclusions i draw from them <e> <s> in the meanwhile i beg leave to awithdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support my noble friend lord montagu <e> <s> it seemed to me at first that the argument for having the same status as the others was unanswerable <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk mentioned the national heritage memorial fund in which i took some interest <e> <s> she will remember that the real reason was not that we had two ministers who might squabble about everything but simply and solely to raise the status of the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> i do not think that the <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as there appears to be an interval during which the noble and learned lord lord simon will consider the point that has been made perhaps i may raise the point as to whether subsection and to a certain extent subsection are really necessary <e> <s> first of all you bring forward a tremendous bill to devolve powers to the boards <e> <s> can they really not be trusted to decide what shall be the hours of opening <e> <s> is it really something which the board of trustees are going to have to discuss with the minister if they wish to close half an hour earlier <e> <s> they are hardly likely to close the place for a whole day or anything like that <e> <s> the minister has sufficient powers not to renew their appointment to put it mildly if they did anything so foolish as that <e>", "<cs> my sympathy is entirely with my noble friend lord craigton on this <e> <s> i have never seen or heard of such an appalling mouthful as originally proposed in the bill <e>

or the noble baronesss solution which i think is slightly better than his <e> <s> i do so agree with the noble lord lord montagu that the word heritage has not been part of our vocabulary for very long <e> <s> i think one day someone will write a very learned thesis for a doctorate on the origin of the word heritage and when it first came into use <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it

standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful answer but would he not agree that the important thing about a question is that it should have some topicality which it cannot do under these circumstances <e> <s> would he consider that the period for tabling a question should be limited to a calendar month without making allowance for the recess
