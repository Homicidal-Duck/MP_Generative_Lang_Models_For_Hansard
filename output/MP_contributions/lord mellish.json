controlled <e> <s> certainly i know that the police are very worried indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that part if not all of this problem is due to the fact that some of the boroughs

avoid any misunderstanding will the minister take it from me that there are many noble lords on both sides of the house who believe that the ownership of britains nuclear deterrent has been absolutely right and that furthermore that that is proven by the fact that today the russians appear to be much more conciliatory than they have been in the past <e> <s> does he agree that it would be quite

good <e> <s> however may we have an assurance that the moment we have a fall of snow and frost all that will not stop <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister understand that much of the overcrowding is

in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that when i tabled the question there was some very bad publicity and a number of

concluded their welcome peace agreement they had in mind the greenham women <e>", "<cs> my lords he said it on television <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily understand the arguments that the minister has put forward and recognise the fact that this matter has gone on for years and years it has not suddenly happened <e> <s> nevertheless does the minister not agree that there is hardship particularly

implemented the national dock labour scheme and made life a little more difficult <e> <s> the unions did not the docklands have been regenerated and credit should be given where it is due <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to get the history books straight is the minister aware that one of the reasons for the decline of docklands as we knew them was the inefficiency of the german bomber <e> <s> it did not bomb the docks very well whereas bomber harris and that crowd wiped the german docks right out <e> <s> the result was that with marshall aid the germans were able to build brand new docks while we

is primarily a london problem <e> <s> it is like talking to yourself with some of these people <e> <s> it is primarily a london problem and relates to only about four london boroughs <e> <s> may i appeal to the minister to consider this as a matter of national urgency to set up a statutory authority whose problem it will be to deal with homelessness and to give it the money and power to solve the problem <e> <s> it should have the power for example to take away from some of the local authorities the empty properties that they possess <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the government say about inflation being the number one enemy <e> <s> that is a view with which i concur absolutely and in my view there is no argument against it <e> <s> however is there not an irony in the situation

and a non-arab although i wonder sometimes whether some of my noble friends are not of one persuasion or the other <e> <s> is the minister aware that some of us respect the reasons for the attitude

anything nice about britain <e> <s> however is it not time to put on the record that britain neither makes chemical weapons nor has a stockpile of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that

minister say what plans the government have for making the river come to life <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that is a backhanded way of trying to say lets get rid of the dock labour scheme <e> <s> if that is the intention of the noble lord then let him get up and say so and not use grimsby or anywhere else <e> <s> further is the minister also aware that while the dock labour scheme involved people at one time today there are only people involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i still think it is nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the increase in the number of

vehement about the matter <e> <s> it is a bad government that abolishes a bill with no alternative whatever to put in its place <e> <s> in other words the government are saying that they are not

continued by saying that now we are in a different time and a different age and therefore the scheme is no longer relevant <e> <s> he said that the unions in particular should co-operate and

"<cs> i should like to put on record the fact that having listened carefully to the minister i am now even more convinced that i was right to oppose the governments bill to abolish the present scheme <e> <s> i am now sure of the reason why the government did what they did <e> <s> we return to the argument about second reading speeches <e> <s> i said then and repeat now that one of the reasons why the government are in trouble today is because they have forgotten people and are concerned only with principles <e> <s> they are concerned only with economics and do not give a damn about ordinary people <e> <s> if the minister had wanted to accept the amendment he could have said it is too long and too wordy <e> <s> however i understand what is behind it so i shall look at it and at report

determined to reject anything and everything said by the opposition <e> <s> i think that it is rather pathetic <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> it comes about does it not <e> <s> because the government have decided to abolish the scheme entirely and put nothing at all in its place <e> <s> either the first scheme was a bad scheme and should never have been introduced or there should be an alternative to safeguard the position <e>", "<cs> it is not surprising that the liberal party finds difficulties with the amendment as it appears on the marshalled

abolition of the scheme and about the fact that nothing is being put in its place <e>", "<cs> it is inevitable i suppose with the abolition of these schemes that the government would also finds reasons for not being associated with convention <e> <s> for years now the dock industry has been quiet well behaved efficient and productive <e> <s> the noble baroness said that legal decisions have been made today which will give the unions the right to make more difficulties in the docks over the abolition of the scheme <e> <s> is that what the government want <e>", "<cs> i should like to get this clear in my mind <e> <s> once this scheme is abolished will those who were registered dockers no longer be registered <e> <s> even in the bad old days they had a tally and that enabled them to be recognised <e> <s> that person would be among the men from whom the employer chose to do his work <e> <s> do i understand now that the registration card is to be abolished as well <e> <s> is the whole lot of it to go to be swept away <e>", "<cs> i should like to put it on record that the government have made their attitude perfectly clear so that we all know where they stand <e> <s> the government are the government and they have all the power <e> <s> it seems that not only will the national dock labour scheme be completely wiped out but also the idea of any registered dockers <e> <s> that will happen overnight <e> <s> at one time there was a tally disc which enabled a docker such as my father to get preference in being selected for work <e> <s> it enabled him to go behind certain gates and barriers and he would be picked because he was a tally-holder <e> <s> afterwards of course things progressed and a registration scheme was introduced <e> <s> a man could not apply for dock work unless he was a registered docker and if i may say so no man would want to apply for dock <e>", "<cs> the amendment states that the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise the difficulties and tragic circumstances of that conflict i do not know whether the minister is now able to put the picture in its right perspective <e> <s> can he give any idea of how many israeli soldiers have died and how many israeli civilians have been hurt or killed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in replying to the question about the economy his answer that everything is fine and on course has somewhat shattered some noble lords <e> <s> if that is so can he explain the results of last thursday <e> <s> does he recognise that high mortgage rates are destroying the hopes and dreams of the party opposite and can he say when it is likely that ordinary people who are buying their own homes will have a better chance <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are talking about community funds and fraud can the minister assure me that included in the investigations will be how much these members receive <e> <s> thats a bit of a lark isnt it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that men do not go on strike lightly and that there is always a reason for doing so <e> <s> he has not said one word about management <e> <s> for example in the dispute with the railways something should be said to the people who are stupid enough to apply to the courts for an injunction the moment they go to acas in the middle of the negotiations <e> <s> everyone agrees that that was foolish and mad <e> <s> is it not about time that the minister and government understand that the threat that they will not work is all that working people have <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rochester is to be congratulated on a minor but important amendment <e> <s> i shall certainly support him <e> <s> if i may say so it is a change for the liberal party to show some concern <e> <s> up to now they have just been in favour of the bill and of abolishing the dock labour scheme and not giving a tuppenny damn <e>", "<cs> they cannot all be dead <e> <s> they just left or they were made redundant and got paid off the same as in any other industry <e> <s> so we are now talking about dockers <e> <s> however then the argument twists <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter now turns it on its head <e> <s> he asks why we should award privileges to a small number of people <e> <s> but what privileges are we talking about <e> <s> is it a privilege to be given decent medical attention <e> <s> the noble lord does not say that the men in the scheme ports are entitled to that medical attention therefore all those employed in the non-scheme ports should receive it as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the bill states that the transitional period <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said and i quote this against him that the idea that medical facilities should be allowed to a small section of these people was wrong unfair improper and that in fact these were privileges that they had no right to retain

lords the minister is giving way <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is that he has such a suspicious mind <e> <s> he believes that everything associated with the dock labour scheme is bad wicked and evil <e> <s> he believes that the scheme should <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what the noble lord meant though <e> <s> he and i fundamentally disagree on this point <e> <s> i have had experience of dock employers <e> <s> i do not deny that as individuals the vast majority of them are courteous kind and decent <e> <s> however it is a roughneck industry <e> <s> it is a bad industry in the sense that when employers themselves try to act as good employers the industry the trade and the barometers make it difficult for them <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i find myself following the noble lord lord boyd carpenter <e> <s> once again i profoundly disagree with everything he said of course i do <e> <s> from the very moment when the scheme was introduced way back in under the original act the noble lord has never hidden i give him full credit for it his animosity towards the scheme and the people who work in it <e> <s> he thinks that it is a privileged section it has no right to be privileged <e> <s> he is not concerned with the past it is all rubbish anyway <e> <s> it is all in the distance he does not wish to know <e> <s> now he objects to any idea that we on this side of the house have that some assurances should be given in writing valid in law about what was casual labour <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister a question arising out of what he said <e> <s> he will know that mr todd has tried to conform to the law as best he can and that there is now a second ballot <e> <s> it is understood that that ballot will not take place until the bill is passed and the scheme has been abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has just said the whole house is indebted to the noble lord lord mccarthy and the noble baroness lady turner for the way in which they have conducted the debates on this bill <e> <s> i should like to put on record that all those associated with the dock industry will be grateful for their

<e> <s> after all if we are to have a balance sheet we ought to have all the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say why it is that all we have heard up to this moment is an anti-jewish argument <e> <s> why are the israeli government doing this <e> <s> is there not a good reason for it <e> <s> is it perhaps due to the fact that they are frightened that at the end of the day they will be stoned have abuse hurled at them and so on by these people <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is aware this is primarily a london problem <e> <s> there is no party politics in this matter <e> <s> surely t he minister will agree that it is about time the government brought the outside agencies together and set up a body to look after homeless people <e> <s> that body could give homeless people advice and it should have power to acquire empty flats from local authorities <e> <s> what is the minister doing about that <e> <s> further if such a body were set up it would be seen that the government were interested in these people <e> <s> the government should not muck about as they are doing at present <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow up the remarks of the front bench <e> <s> the construction industry training board has been in operation for many years and has achieved enormous success <e> <s> let me ask a straight question <e> <s> am i to understand that the governments proposals are to help the board to succeed further and that they will back it financially <e> <s> is it in fact the case that the construction industry board will not in any way be affected by government decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if this suggestion were implemented the difficulty would be that the students would never get back their accommodation <e> <s> the answer is as straight as that <e> <s> if the homeless are rehoused in such a manner it will surely show desperation <e> <s> is the minister aware therefore that it is a problem primarily concerning london where frankly the only solution is for the government themselves to intervene with regional set-ups which will look after the homeless and will have powers to acquire from local authorities the empty properties which they have no justification for holding <e>", "<cs> it should be a conservative speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that southwark council now has the planning application <e> <s> when did the council receive it and when can we expect to receive an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords when will that be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us believe that shakespeare probably moved all over the place while he worked at this site <e> <s> in any case the importance of the whole area of my beloved bermondsey with which i used to be associated

revenue and no effort is made to return it <e> <s> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister note that those of us who have experience of wages councils have found that the wages that they set which are the minimum wages permitted are then adopted by many employers as the maximum <e>", "<cs> my lords to put the record straight is the minister aware that some of us on this side of the house believe that there is no point in having a nuclear weapon unless one tests it to find out whether it goes off <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> secondly one does not abandon such tests until all the countries in the world agree to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the past to years there has been a dramatic change in the demand for hospital beds <e> <s> for example years ago the replacement of hips was unknown as were heart transplants and so forth <e> <s> there has been a tremendous advance in medical science <e> <s> does that change of demand which is now

removed <e> <s> the minister accepted that there is an anomaly <e> <s> he told us why things could be different and how much it would cost <e> <s> but perhaps i may remind the minister that this government paid something like billion or was it even more than that <e> <s> into the national debt <e> <s> is the minister telling us that the government cannot find million <e>", "<cs> my lords is

that the council will be able to spend the money on new housing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recognise that one government introduced the dock labour scheme but another government utterly and completely destroyed it without any tangible reason that one could understand <e> <s> pressures from certain members of this house were instrumental in destroying the scheme <e> <s> can the minister give the house some idea of how much the assets are worth <e> <s> does he know <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that some of us were intrigued by the statement in the question that foreign nurses who are being employed to make up the shortfall may be exploited <e> <s> as far as i can judge the reply that the minister gave has not resolved that problem <e> <s> is she further aware that if i had any evidence that such exploitation was occurring i would go direct to the minister and would not waste my time putting down a question <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that the buoyancy of the construction industry is a barometer for the nation as a whole <e> <s> if the industry is doing well so is the nation <e> <s> that is a fact of life <e> <s> can the minister give details of the present position and state how he sees the future in regard to house building in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that however much one puts into the nhs it is never <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while recognising the need for a review and reconsideration of our armed forces the vast majority of the public are convinced that britain should not drop its guard in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall repeat what i said earlier because it is worth saying <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that no matter how much money is put into the national health service it will never be enough <e> <s> she stated that spending had increased to about billion <e> <s> is the minister aware that it is still not enough and that whatever she does she will be criticised <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords present today will be delighted to hear that i do not propose to speak for very long <e> <s> first with modesty i wish to commend the noble lord who opened the debate for those of us who sit on this side of the house <e> <s> his case was superb <e> <s> this bill is supposed to be about industrial relations <e> <s> it is supposed to improve the situation and produce a panacea for the employers and the unions so that they get together in a working partnership in order to make life better for the community <e> <s> that is what the minister really said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they are <e> <s> i say that frankly <e> <s> anyone who is first in the queue to put out his hand to take an increase in salary or an improvement in conditions but yet says i shall have nothing whatever to do with the so-called trade unions who helped me get it is a prostitute <e> <s> that opinion may not be liked but it is true <e>", "<cs> my lords my views on the closed shop are i believe practical <e> <s> i asked the minister i hope he will now reply exactly what employers organisations have pleaded with the government to get rid of it <e> <s> at least he should answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister again <e> <s> he is very courteous <e> <s> i give an example of cargo which arrives at the port of embarkation <e> <s> it is in a bad condition <e> <s> the men refuse to work at a particular rate of pay and they go on strike <e> <s> the employers will not give way and say that that is the rate for the job <e> <s> the result is that or men may be affected by the dispute <e> <s> is the minister telling me that there should be a ballot to avoid a dispute of that kind <e> <s> how is it possible to have a ballot concerning a cargo which if it is not dealt with straightaway will never be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of those on this side of the house believe that there would not be a france were it not for the americans and the british the nation of france would not exist <e> <s> that is my first question <e> <s> secondly does he agree that it is odd that france is not a member of nato and still believes that she won the battle of waterloo <e> <s> has the minister anything to say about that <e>", "<cs> my lords so that we have it right will the minister accept that some members on this side of the house are delighted by what was said <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us find this question and answer session quite extraordinary <e> <s> after all there is such a thing as a waste-paper basket <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that from to i was chairman of a hospital management committee <e> <s> during that time we had no knowledge of hip replacements heart transplants or indeed heart complaints in that sense <e> <s> there has been such an advance in medical knowledge since that it has overtaken everything that is going on <e> <s> people are waiting now for that which they never waited they just died <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that with the change in the european situation in particular there appears to be an opportunity for financial savings on defence <e> <s> however does he recognise it is because this country had the sense to hold on to its armaments under both labour and conservative governments that we have been able to contribute to the peace of the world over the past years <e> <s> can he give me an assurance that savings will not be at the expense of making britain a third rate power <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am one of those who support the closed shop principle but that fact is not to be confused with the views of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not on record that the government have said that the construction industry training board scheme is the finest in britain and an example to be followed <e> <s> does it not flow from that that cuts should not be directed at what the government consider is one of the finest training schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the vast majority of social welfare workers do a first class job <e> <s> they really do <e> <s> they have had so much criticism lately <e> <s> it has been shown in recent cases that short of actually living in the house and stopping the man coming home drunk and beating a child almost to death there is nothing a social welfare worker can do <e> <s> is it not about time that we put that on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in this house in the other place and among the public generally there are very strong elements that are bitterly opposed to the ec and its membership <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that it is extraordinary that money we allow to the ec is spent doing the very opposite of what we are doing in this country <e> <s> can the noble earl explain that <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government pro-gorbachev against gorbachev or neutral <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak next tuesday on the employment bill <e> <s> will the minister give me an assurance that the governments attitude will be that if a man wishes to join a trade union he will be allowed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us have experience of the ways in which community health councils operate <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to learn that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and myself are completely opposite in our arguments and attitude <e> <s> on one point i do agree <e> <s> this clause ends the closed shop as we know it <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> i am speaking because again i want to say something about the closed shop <e> <s> i make it abundantly clear that i speak for myself <e> <s> i do not speak for the opposition front bench or for the labour party as such <e> <s> what i have to say is based on my own experience and what <e>", "<cs> yes but i have only just started <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i am in favour of the closed shop <e> <s> i shall tell the committee why <e> <s> perhaps i am old fashioned outdated or outmoded noble lords can say what they like but i was brought up in an industry where the closed shop was welcomed by the employers <e> <s> indeed the employers insisted that all workers in the industry should be members of the union <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are talking about homelessness is it not a fact that the vast majority of homeless people have been discovered to be mentally handicapped and that something is now being done for them <e> <s> will the minister say something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good to hear the minister say that the government have special regard for hospices <e> <s> is she aware that recently i had occasion to visit a hospice run by nuns <e> <s> they are looking after people who are dying and have no hope in this world <e> <s> the hospitals had to refuse them care and if it were not for the people who run hospices i do not know what would happen to them <e> <s> can the minister confirm her high regard and recommend that the government are as generous as possible to such people who deserve every penny they get <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures which the minister has given are very exciting <e> <s> however is she aware that no matter how much money is spent it will never be enough <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past there was the war pensions appeals tribunal <e> <s> anyone who was rejected for a pension by the ministry had a right to appeal to what was mainly a lay body <e> <s> the two issues involved were attributability and aggravation <e> <s> i speak as one who went before that board many times <e> <s> i found that if one could show that some aggravation was caused through war service or in this case radiation the tribunal would without any shadow of doubt find in ones favour <e> <s> does that still apply today and have these people the right to appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the phrase opting out really means that hospitals want to get away from what some of them call the dead hand of bureaucracy which is applied by the district health authority <e> <s> i must therefore ask the following questions <e> <s> can the minister say who are the people in the district health authorities <e> <s> further when they make a good decision who is the person above them who says no we shall not have that either <e>", "<cs> i know that <e>", "<cs> my lords as a londoner although it is impertinent of me to interfere in scottish affairs nevertheless my common sense tells me that those who do not pay the community charge would not have paid rates either <e>", "<cs> my lords i joined the party in <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak very much as an independent and i base my views on the fact that i have lived a rather long life that has taken me through the late s the whole of the s the second world war and years in another place <e> <s> that experience gives me the right at least to express a view <e> <s> i do not take any party line and i have not done so for a long time <e> <s> i speak as a man who has lived through the past to years <e>", "<cs> my lords mussolini and hitler were both hooligans anyway <e> <s> all i know is that the league of nations was destroyed through the inactivity of the great powers as regards any collective action against a bully <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister surely agrees that doctors are entitled to protection <e> <s> how many people have been asked for their consent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is simple enough <e> <s> how many patients have been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some members on this side of the house believe that it would be quite mad to say to the united nations please sir may we attack iraq <e> <s> i have never heard anything so daft <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that sellafield is open every day to the public <e> <s> will he not agree that it would be a good idea if members of this house took the trouble to go there and find out for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords setting aside party politics if that is possible perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> is it not a fact that london which i happen to believe is the capital city of the world should have an authority of its own not only to deal with planning but also other matters such as housing <e> <s> at present london is fragmented into a large number of boroughs which are politically divided <e> <s> there is chaos throughout <e> <s> will the minister do something about that and set up a proper authority <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords at least one marriage has worked for years <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is any truth in the story is that not further evidence that it is essential for britain to retain its own nuclear capability <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please take note of the fact that i am one of the small minority mentioned who is opposed to any change <e>", "<cs> my lords what percentage of admissions are for serious operations and what percentage are for minor operations <e> <s> secondly is there any hope of speeding up the arrangements for people to be operated on on the day of admission and discharged the same day <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in between lewisham hospital and guys hospital is a hospital called st olaves which was closed with its beds lock stock and barrel before this wretched government even came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his last reply will certainly meet with a happy response from this side of the house <e> <s> it does not matter a tuppenny damn who are iraqis and who are not <e> <s> saddam hussein has no right to walk into an undefended country like kuwait and tear it apart <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will understand that the construction industry is a barometer of the nations economy <e> <s> no member on either side of the house can deny that at present the industry is in a bad state <e> <s> when is there likely to be an upturn in the industry and in its output <e>", "<cs> sit down <e> <s> for once in your life shut up <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to get the position absolutely clear <e> <s> is it right to say that the vast majority of jobs carried out for example in the secretarial sector of the metropolitan police are carried out by civilians and not by the police at all <e>"]
