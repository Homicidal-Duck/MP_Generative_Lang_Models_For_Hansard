["<cs> my lords this debate follows quite naturally and logically the more general debate that we had on energy resources on th july <e> <s> but i think that the key to lord sherfields motion is the growing urgency surrounding the energy situation in europe and the three reports interrelated as they are cover aspects which will have to be faced by all member states of the community and just as much by us after we have lost our self-sufficiency rating <e> <s> the reports include these two major research activities namely the second energy r and d programme and the fusion research programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord sherfield for introducing this motion <e> <s> the new commission document tries to identify the very important objective issues in energy but regrettably they are conceived from a rather subjective and fragmented base over which there is no proper community control mechanism in the form of some intervention machinery which could be used to steer the community rapidly in the right direction <e> <s> the european coal and steel community and the euratom machinery have not over the years achieved any lasting impression on europe but they show a form of intervention which could provide a useful function in the energy field <e> <s> however i imagine it is too late to remould these two treaties but they obviously have some further uses <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble lord lord gregson for introducing this report and one might say for making parliament go electric <e> <s> first having run with the fox giving evidence i should also like to thank him for allowing me also to hunt with the hounds and be with the committee <e> <s> this first quarry of the select committee could not have been better chosen <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord ran it to earth after a search which went very wide and deep <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord cranbrook on his excellent introduction of this subject of asbestos which has an ongoing concern and interest for everybody in this country or in fact everybody in the world <e> <s> i am also very grateful to him for allowing the asbestos counter to be demonstrated to the committee because the development of this particular counter was supported by the eec <e> <s> i want to talk about this later and also to declare an interest <e> <s> i was very interested also in what the noble earl lord gosford had to say because i think he touched on a number of points that do concern us <e> <s> he talked about enforcement <e> <s> he talked about the position of this country in the way it can lead developments in asbestos <e> <s> he also talked about a ban <e> <s> i hope that what i have to say will help him to understand the present situation in better perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to comment on the idea for a european reference laboratory and say whether the role could be taken over by the institute of occupational medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords if this waste is dioxin as a lot of people suspect would my noble friend confirm that there are firms which have the competence and the capability to incinerate this stuff which reduces it to harmless waste <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this debate is significant because it is the first one to follow the debate on the address and i think it concentrates our attention very much on one of the important subjects that of the governments resolve to <e>", "<cs> my lords first as one of his supporters let me join other noble lords in congratulating the noble and gallant lord lord lewin on his outstanding and very clear maiden speech <e> <s> it has given us an opportunity of hearing a voice from the navy at a time when ship design has been the talking point for some months now <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am not a farmer and i hope that the house will forgive me if i show some ignorance of things agricultural <e> <s> but in essence the bill is not a farmers bill it is very much a non-farmers bill <e> <s> i live in essex where the county council supports a ban on burning in the same county as the noble lord lord alport and i have had to call the fire brigade to my own property in the past which is entirely surrounded by arable land as is his in order to deal with fire from adjacent straw burning <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say that i believe that we do not wish to force the scientific community into overreaching itself in order to produce commercially viable processing plant but i believe that a date for the ban can be set now and reviewed before coming into force so that parliament can if necessary decide to delay it for a further period <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be certain that there will be but i believe that the prospect is very good <e> <s> i have evidence from colleagues in industry whom i have consulted that things are moving ahead in this way so that there is a strong prospect of commercial processing plant being available within five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is possible for the bill to be altered in committee so that we can review the date nearer <e>", "<cs> i should first like to apologise to the committee for not being here when my noble friend lord alport was speaking but i should like to intervene at this stage to speak about my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble friend lord belstead has said about my amendment i think i am happy to withdraw it at this stage but i should like to study what he has said in detail and if necessary raise the whole matter again at the report stage <e> <s> one particular thing that he said worried me <e> <s> in the model by-laws he requires the fire fighting services to be informed when burning is to take place but no mention is made of informing neighbours or owners of adjacent land <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this clause amendment now incorporates the ingredients of an acceptable licensing method and i should like to give it my support <e> <s> however i should like to make a few remarks about the guidelines which the minister will be expected to take into account first that he should observe good agricultural practice is i think a meaningful phrase to people like myself who are not farmers <e> <s> just because a profession adopts a practice it does not automatically mean that it is a good one in the sense that it is directly acceptable to society and complies with maximum health standards and minimum nuisance levels <e> <s> in fact good practice implies that other factors have been taken into account such as cost effectiveness clean technology and proper resource management all of which are of just as much concern to society as is the quality of life <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord the minister for one moment what i was talking about was the grid supply lines rather than telegraph poles or anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of placing research and development work in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords following on my noble friends supplementary question can my noble friend the minister say whether these names from the leander class frigate vessels which now number will be perpetuated in the royal navy as they have served the royal navy very well for centuries <e> <s> can my noble friend give the house some assurance that the tradition of using these names will not be scuttled without trace <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not speak in last nights debate because i felt that my remarks were more suited to this afternoons debate <e> <s> nevertheless <e> <s> i think that the theme of both debates is management of defence and the management of a budget of some million up from million last year with the employment and deployment of some half a million people of whom are civilian <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that it is insufficient to have more human intelligence and what we need is more artificial intelligence <e> <s> would he tell the house what plans he has for introducing more scientific methods of detection of these sort of goods entering the country such as the use of robotic noses instead of sniffer dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that the breathalyser is suitable for testing for alcohol may i ask this question <e> <s> does the minister not agree that in cases where the police suspect drugs it is very necessary to have a blood test <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will bear this significant point in mind in making his assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords both the reports which we are debating today show that the eec commission is into acid rain <e> <s> like the common cold it will not go away very easily <e> <s> it is considered both here and in another place whose environment committees report is a useful complement to our discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say how many of the bidders to which he referred were involved with the high technology classified work and how many were involved with the unclassified work <e> <s> will my noble friend not agree that in industry in this country we want to aim to get the maximum amount of the high technology classified contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i will if i may ask my noble friend two questions which i believe come under the heading of the commercial management option <e> <s> i think it is true to say that the bidders for operating the dockyards under the management option would be from the major engineering companies in this country which are also supplying the capital needs of the dockyards and they have great experience of repair and maintenance and that kind of thing in dockyards <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of gas now to domestic consumers as a service similar to the telephone water and electricity services perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> does my noble friend not think that is important to consider among other things under the new privatisation arrangements for the gas corporation a much wider distribution of gas to domestic consumers in the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that legionnaires disease seems to be associated with water circulation plant downstream of the metering points and bearing in mind that in the united kingdom we are accustomed to a mains supply which is wholesome and disinfected upstream of the metering point does my noble friend feel that there is now a necessity to look more carefully at the regulations governing disinfection of water below the metering point when it is used in water circulation plant and other treatment plant involving items such as washing and air conditioning <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke in last years debate i did not imagine that today defence procurement would feature so strongly in my interests in fact so strongly that i would have to declare them <e> <s> my interest is a direct one as the defence market coordinator for a british-owned engineering group of companies in the million per year contractor club <e> <s> just to put things into perspective for the first division contractors in the million-plus club a single contract could qualify them for the million club and it is therefore welcome news that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am one who welcomes these proposals for the commercial management option and if i may i should like to ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first he has said that the government will go out to competitive tender for contracts involving some years of operation <e> <s> i think that the house will be aware that the experience of goco contracts only really exists in the united states and that the contracts there are complicated <e> <s> in this country we are in an evolutionary process with the dockyards and the commercial management proposals <e> <s> will the noble lord give the house some assurance that the contractual arrangements will be kept simple <e> <s> we are in this evolutionary period and we want to develop the best method of conducting this particular operation <e> <s> i hope too that the contract period can be longer than five years and preferably eight years or even more <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will answer the second question about whether the successful contractors will also be able to compete for capital equipment requirements when they arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord bessborough for tabling this unstarred question this evening because i think that it is again time for us to take stock of the progress being <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee f my congratulations go also to the noble lord lord kings norton on the expert way he introduced the debate on the esprit report and the capable way in which he chaired the inquiry on this very critical subject of information technology which now pervades every aspect of our lives <e> <s> as the noble earl lord bessborough said esprit is a very well chosen word which describes that bodily sense of being part of a venture in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords will it be possible for my noble friend to place a copy of the agreement in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister not agree that the strategy here is to disarm or to destroy the missiles when they are in the boost phase before they have got up speed before the warheads have been divided thereby creating what is in effect an umbrella over the airspace of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that industry puts a lot of money up front for bidding for contracts <e> <s> can my noble friend persuade his right honourable friend that it is very important to award contracts on time in view of the fact that delay means that industry has to service the borrowings which are put up in order to bid <e> <s> will my noble friend please bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> i am one of those who do not support the amendment but before saying something about it i have an interest to declare in that i am connected with one of the companies which was invited to tender <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord denning said i think the nuclear submarine refit complexes in a dockyard are in fact a major part of ship repair maintenance and servicing and one has only to go to devonport to see this <e> <s> we live in the time of the submarine and of anti-submarine warfare <e>", "<cs> i should like to make some comments on this amendment <e> <s> i was surprised at this very long period of years being suggested because in fact one introduces more risk elements into this longer period and therefore certainly one would need a trial period to begin with to see how the operation fared <e> <s> we are treading new territory here with the dockyards after such a long saga of knowing them as they have been and i think that we are somewhat inspired by the american experience which has existed with the goco contracts the government-owned contractor operated schemes which run pretty well over there <e> <s> they have their troubles as well and new territory is being trodden there <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning has already made some of the points that i was going to make <e> <s> in fact i see that the matter is laid down in the invitation to tender documents <e> <s> i see also that the requirement at devonport will be apprentices and about at rosyth <e> <s> that is somewhat smaller than the requirements as they exist at present <e>", "<cs> my lords before starting i declare my interest with a british engineering group supplying equipment and services to the ministry of defence <e> <s> what i say therefore will be largely connected with procurement <e> <s> as my noble friend lord trefgarne has said this now amounts to some per cent <e> <s> of the billion budget <e> <s> my remarks will be coloured to some extent by my own experiences <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what rating formula is used in scotland for private suppliers and public suppliers by comparison with that used now in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that this is now a very popular type of operation and that people are beginning to return for a second replacement can my noble friend say what proportion of the operations in were actual replacement operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord torrington for introducing this subject which we are now debating <e> <s> as a member of sub-committee f i should like to congratulate him i am afraid the noble viscount is not in the chamber at the moment on the way that he chaired the committee in this inquiry <e> <s> if russian reactors are accident prone he is not because he kept the line of inquiry absolutely on course throughout the aftermath of the chernobyl accident <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say in view of the fact that limestone is an important feedstock for the flue gas desulphurisation plants which are going to be built in this country in the future whether this quarry has a significant part to play in the supply of limestone to the cegb <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford on his short and witty speech <e> <s> i hope that we shall all hear him speak on other subjects in your lordships house <e> <s> i am taking my grandchildren down to cornwall this summer and after listening to what he had to say about cornwall i have no intention of cancelling my plans <e>", "<cs> my lords when the late lord hinton and i visited the joint research centre at eastborough to look at the issue of siting the jet project in this country little did we expect that there would be different conditions of employment between the european members and our own people <e> <s> but we found that the issue centred on the <e>", "<cs> setting up of a european school for the education of the children of community employees <e> <s> this was done by the government of noble lords opposite <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend whether the ukaea employees working at jet qualify to send their children to the european school <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the early warning and the intelligence-gathering role of the fylingdales station within the bmews world-wide network is absolutely vital to the nato alliance <e> <s> can he confirm that the united kingdom contractors are still very strongly placed to <e>", "<cs> my lords what progress is being made on the development of a robotic nose to detect drugs <e> <s> i believe that the laboratory of the government chemist and british aerospace have been working on this problem for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the additional capacity which is required by the mid-nineties can be met by coal-fired stations <e> <s> would he not agree that a nuclear power element is needed if we are to meet this additional capacity that is required <e>", "<cs> my lords once the uk profile on so <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what type of flue gas-desulphurisation plant will be fitted at fawley by the cegb <e> <s> will it be a limestone gypsum plant or a limestone sulphuric acid plant <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise sincerely to the house for not being present at the beginning of the debate and in particular to my noble friend lord beloff for not being there to hear what i understand was his very philosophical speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the army boot classified as a non-warlike piece of equipment and will tenders for its replacement be invited in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in encouraging greater competition in defence contracting can my noble friend say what is the extent of government policy now in inviting foreign bidders to take part in the competitions <e> <s> within the figures mentioned for what went out to competitive tendering in the past year can he say by value what proportion was awarded to foreign firms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult in a debate like this to avoid being repetitive <e> <s> i shall not deal with generalities i shall limit myself to three points that i should like to make <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure the house that the new science reference and information service reading rooms will be open on schedule in december and in order to do that that the moving of books to fill the kilometres of shelf space will begin in <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has triggered off much public concern about firearms <e> <s> the more i look at the present position of the regulations on their use <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a very much more difficult task to have a new firearms bill before us <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and i should point out that i raised these points at second reading <e> <s> like my noble friend lord dilhorne i am not a lawyer and i should like to speak in a more practical way about this issue which revolves around the phrase to a substantial extent <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which introduces the words bona fide would be difficult for the police to interpret because they are not lawyers either <e> <s> they could not interpret the provision unless the home secretary was able to give some specific guidance on what is meant by the words <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether using lead-free petrol means that there is any fall off in petrol consumption figures for a model which can use it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that this very welcome concession will apply to those taking part in aidex which is the first international defence exhibition in australia at the end of november <e> <s> the cut-off date is th may this year <e> <s> it may well be that certain people have already applied and paid their money <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what the construction programme is for royal fleet auxiliaries <e> <s> the royal navy fleet depends very much on these support vessels <e> <s> in particular is there any plan for the construction of the aircraft support ship <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister say whether a collar was awarded at the same time as the grand cross <e> <s> does he agree that a collar is in any case the property of her majestys government <e> <s> will he say whether any reciprocal award was made during the state visit to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate comes at a critical time with the whiff of disarmament in the air <e> <s> but i wonder whether it will become stronger or whether it is only something designed merely to deflect our senses away from other more fundamental issues <e> <s> i believe that the truth lies somewhere in between <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend for one moment <e> <s> can he say what the ordering plan for the third vanguard class submarine is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> my concern is for the future as there is likely to be more slippage in frigate ordering and also because the nfr project definition phase has fallen apart <e> <s> therefore can my noble friend say what will happen to supermarine consortium limited which is the uk shareholder in the nfr project definition phase <e> <s> is there not a case for keeping the project in being as we now have to look for a rn frigate for the s to replace the type especially bearing in mind the fact that the government are now looking at whole ship procurement and are placing much greater reliance upon industry to provide the solutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what my noble friend has said about the supermarine consortium but will he give further consideration to the idea of keeping it in being <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the resolution on sub-contracting adopted by the council of ministers on th september which expresses a need for a much sharper legal framework with particular reference to periods of payment does my noble friend agree that legislation is now required <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that owners of private car parks are now able to use clamps on cars which are illegally parked in those places <e> <s> it is now legal for clamps to be used on the roads but can he say whether it is legal to use them in private places <e>", "<cs> my lords the award of the contract for three frigates to swan hunter is one thing but can my noble friend say when the keel laying will start as that will produce the increase in employment at the yard <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for coming clean with that answer disappointing as it is <e> <s> it shows that environmentally clean electric vehicles are still struggling hard to keep up with the sea of internal combustion engine vehicles now on our roads <e>", "<cs> in spite of the considerable government aid that has been given over the past years which is welcome is my noble friend aware that tough clean air legislation is about to be enacted in the united states to force car makers to use cleaner fuels <e> <s> does he agree that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very informative answer <e> <s> i hope that all the firms concerned will take note of what he has said <e> <s> i speak as a member of the council of the defence <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who has read this years statement might on first thoughts feel very bullish about the state of affairs with cash plans firmly in place for the next three years but the bearishness of the secretary of states introduction casts a shadow over the whole statement or most of it anyway <e> <s> but it is still opportune to have this debate because the government will be able to listen to what we have to say at this moment in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one with an industrial interest to declare i think that industry will certainly want to give much more study to the statement that has been made <e> <s> nothing precise can be said at the moment <e>"]
