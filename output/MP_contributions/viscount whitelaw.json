["<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees of this house for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos i think it is fair to point out that if one takes the four years as a whole we have achieved a refund of two-thirds of our net contributions some per cent <e> <s> this is a very considerable achievement considering what was said by many of the other nations before the summit took place <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point that the noble lord lord kennet puts forward it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot at this stage give the noble lord lord beswick the answer to that question because various discussions are still continuing in the community and in the various councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord elystan-morgan will excuse me when i say that i shall really need notice before i can give him the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who speaks with great experience on these matters <e> <s> regarding other countries accepting us as full members i would have thought that the election result however one might look at the votes certainly made it clear that the british people had no time for wishing to leave the community <e> <s> that is a very important development <e> <s> they realise that leaving the community would cost jobs for this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that in another capacity i have some of the same interests that he has <e> <s> i would equally say to him that already the finances of the community are in a very critical situation <e> <s> that is why these discussions are so desperately important <e> <s> the position of the future of the common agricultrual policy and how it works is at the very centre of the discussions which are now to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should wish to be drawn on that particular point this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into complete detail on that point i would say to my noble friend that he will have observed the passage in the gracious speech which made a clear reference to the commitment of this country to gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly it depends on agreement but it does not as i understand it depend on the final agreement of all the other financial matters <e> <s> the decision on the british refund was agreed specially away from those other discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to cross swords too much with the noble lord with whom i have crossed swords in the past in another place i shall simply say that one point which was made clear was that those people who tried to get us out of the community and argued to go out of the community were very decisively rejected <e>", "<cs> as soon as possible my lords is the answer that i must give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that there is no question of downgrading the position as she fears <e> <s> mr fletcher has considerable responsibilities in a new and much bigger department <e> <s> the government feel that to have a minister in a much bigger department responsible to a secretary of state with wider responsibilities does give consumer affairs and competition policy the position that they ought to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead will be taking the lead on trade matters assisted by my noble friend lord lyell <e> <s> questions on consumer matters will normally be dealt with by one of them in the same way as other trade matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the view that because a television company or various television channels take an interest in a particular matter it means that the government are not doing so <e> <s> that would surely be a very curious doctrine for us to adopt in parliament as a whole <e> <s> i maintain that the government take considerable responsibilities so far as consumer affairs are concerned and consider them to be very important <e> <s> if the work of the government and of the minister for consumer affairs in the department of trade and industry is helped by these television channels and abuses are brought forward then that enables him to do his job more effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i shall be drawn into that argument all over again <e> <s> the minister will be responsible for all consumer affairs but he will be responsible directly to the secretary of state for trade and industry and that means that the secretary of state himself will take a personal interest in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is a very sound point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble baroness that it is not intended to be so <e> <s> i will of course <e>", "<cs> my lords he will have other responsibilities as well as consumer policies <e> <s> he will also be responsible for some of the radio regulation and radio frequency policies which were previously dealt with through the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has as always put his finger on a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be fair for me to reply to the noble lord that things in northern ireland are not exactly the same as in other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> in that respect it was for a local assembly and not for a national parliament which i regard as being quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords having myself fought i think general elections in my time i have come to regard the number of people returned to the house of commons as a decisive answer in a general election <e> <s> on that basis i should have thought that the result was very decisive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that there are <e> <s> if there are it is their affair and not mine and i am not in favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> i still maintain that a system of proportional representation would not be in the best interests of this country <e> <s> that is what i believe and i am sticking to my belief <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the position in scotland but i think that the noble lord and others wish scotland to be part of the united kingdom and therefore it is the result for the whole of the united kingdom that really matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that would be a construction to be placed on my remarks <e> <s> my noble friend was giving his reasons for having changed his mind <e> <s> i gave my reasons for not having changed my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful for such comments from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord with his great experience of politics should believe everything he reads in the press <e> <s> i can assure him that the deductions he has reached are not accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for having informed my office that he wished to raise this matter <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will think it reasonable if i draw on my experience in another place as well as my very short experience here to explain to him the position <e> <s> i am most anxious to do this because i should wish neither him nor the house to think that i was in any way guilty of any discourtesy in this matter and i do not think that i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that that is certainly our purpose and our intention and we shall work to that end <e> <s> our contribution to the alliance must he good not just in its breadth but in its quality <e> <s> at least as important as the quality of our equipment is the quality of our servicemen and women <e> <s> as noble lords will i am sure agree that quality is of the highest and has been seen to be so whenever and wherever tested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond for what he said about my participation in the debate <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord as to so many noble lords for their kind help in what has been the extremely difficult task of arriving for the first time in your lordships house and finding oneself seeking to the best of ones ability to lead it <e> <s> to the extent that the noble lord or rather the debate has given me some further instruction and food for thought i am for that reason extremely grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> first of all to the noble lord lord cledwyn i would say that i am extremely appreciative of the fact that he welcomes the meeting as i think do people in both countries and i believe that it is all to the good of relations between the two countries <e> <s> the noble lord raised the question of the forum and asked what priority would my right honourable friend give to it <e> <s> my right honourable friend was briefed by dr fitzgerald on the work of the forum <e> <s> as a government we have made it clear that the deliberations of the forum are a matter for those engaged in them <e> <s> it is in that spirit that they will all be considered and the report will be considered when it is finally concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i have learned over a long period of time always to study leading articles in <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not seek to dispute what the noble lord an old friend of mine from another place years ago has said <e> <s> i just think that my point about the interests of the whole house was a reasonable one <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord lord hatch has had an opportunity to pursue his case <e> <s> i feel that i allowed him to pursue it longer than perhaps i would have done if i had not felt slightly personally involved in a difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords while i much appreciate that which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has said and his decision not to divide the house it would be open to me as he will appreciate to debate the reasons for my decision <e> <s> i felt that it would not be in the best interests of the house to do so unless very pressed <e> <s> but if i were to promise that there would be an immediate or very quick opportunity for this house to debate this matter i believe it would be dangerous for me to do so on that basis <e> <s> i must point out to the house that this matter has been discussed in very considerable detail and debated and voted upon in another place as well over a long period of time <e> <s> that would be the basis of my view <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a matter for the house to decide <e> <s> i understand that the rules are set out in standing order no <e> <s> <e> <s> no question may be put onto the order paper for a date more than one month ahead but in reckoning that period no account is taken of any time during which the house is in recess <e> <s> if however the house was to change that and decide that the recess should not be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly true <e> <s> i think that there has been a considerable improvement since the new arrangements were made which was of course before i came to my present position <e> <s> the order paper indicates that the first available date for putting down a question is now th december which after all is only three weeks ahead <e> <s> if we disregard the question of the recess i think that shows that the situation is reasonably satisfactory <e> <s> if the house wished to pursue the question of the recess in this connection it would be perfectly proper for the procedure committee to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely in the hands of the house in these matters <e> <s> i accept at once that the arrangements that have been made for the number of questions that may be tabled and the times at which they may he tabled have made a considerable improvement <e> <s> i am told by some noble lords that i am too reasonable about the time for which i am allowing question time to continue <e> <s> i am totally in the hands of the house <e> <s> i seek to judge the mood of the house on every particular question <e> <s> if it is said that i am too reasonable i know that i am perhaps considered not sufficiently reasonable by those to whom i am being reasonable and very unreasonable by those to whom i am less reasonable <e> <s> i understand all that but i shall continue to do my best <e>", "<cs> my lords that can of course be considered but i understand from my noble friend the chief whip who is always willing quickly to advise me on such matters that that was considered by the procedure committee and was rejected <e> <s> that does not mean that the committee might not change its mind on a future occasion <e> <s> the matter could certainly be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady raises another point which would inevitably extend the period for questions but as i say it is in the hands of the house <e> <s> i am advised that the house feels that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for noble lords as to how they judge their questions <e> <s> it is entirely a matter for the house whether we have more time for questions <e> <s> i am in your lordships hands <e> <s> i am prepared to discuss with any noble lord personally or through the usual channels whether this is something that is wanted <e> <s> i am so far advised that it is not so i hope that we shall be able to continue some arrangement on the same lines <e> <s> i shall certainly consider all the points that have been put during this exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should make the position which perhaps the noble lord does not quite appreciate clear <e> <s> in my duty as leader of the house i have to consider a private notice question put down by any noble lord irrespective of the bench that it may come from <e> <s> of course i do that <e> <s> i have to be guided by the convention of the house that the matter must be urgent and topical <e> <s> i have to consider it on that basis <e> <s> indeed i do just that <e> <s> in case there should be any doubt i add that if a private notice question is accepted in another place that raises different issues <e> <s> the noble lord may now be referring to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships <e> <s> i am acutely conscious that when one marches up one day one goes down the next <e> <s> i shall do my best to continue on an even keel <e>", "<cs> of course i will my lords <e> <s> i am sorry if i have done what i constantly tell all my fellow ministers they must not do that is to stray outside the original question <e> <s> i realise therefore that my previous answer was all too correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to the statement and for the general welcome they have given to the holding of a commonwealth prime ministers conference and its value <e> <s> it is very easy to point to the resolutions as being compromises or in some cases as not meaning very much but surely the important point is that the conference provided the opportunity to have a dialogue and discussion with many nations from different parts of the world which hold totally different points of view on many issues of world-wide significance <e> <s> the fact that the nations of the commonwealth so diverse as they are can come together and have a dialogue and discussion is surely of great value <e> <s> those who criticise these conferences for not coming to more concrete conclusions sometimes claim at the same time how vital it is that there should be dialogue and discussion in the world <e> <s> they cannot have it both ways <e> <s> if therefore dialogue and discussion take place on this scale surely it is of value to the world and to the commonwealth <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend the prime minister feels very strongly that this is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords mr trudeau went on this tour on his own initiative but he had had the benefit of discussions with his colleagues at the commonwealth prime ministersconference <e> <s> naturally the talks would be held in the light of the knowledge he had gained from his commonwealth colleagues <e> <s> perhaps i could say at this point that the previous answer i gave was wrong <e> <s> the figure was not million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to inform my noble friend and the house that i understand that the prime minister and mr mugabe had a very useful exchange of views <e> <s> the prime <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords second point which i shall answer first this matter was remitted for study by the commonwealth secretary-general <e> <s> no further decision was taken <e> <s> it is for the secretary-general to report his conclusions as a result of his study <e> <s> i do not wish to make further commitments beyond that <e> <s> the noble lords first point has certainly not been discussed or decided <e> <s> everybody hopes it is known that the united states government so hope that it will be possible for united states forces to he withdrawn from grenada as soon as possible <e> <s> the question of assistance and who would take over has still be be discussed in a wider forum than the commonwealth prime ministers conference <e> <s> it is for the governor to decide when he thinks it would be best to hold the elections but we remain ready to help should we be required to do so in the conduct of those elections or with any policing problems which might arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i must answer my noble friend by saying that if this was discussed during the conference it did not appear in the communique <e> <s> i have no knowledge of what was said during the detailed discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his general welcome of the commonwealth conference and the possibility of so many nations with diverse views as i said earlier coming to substantial agreement on many issues <e> <s> equally the noble lord was generous to mention the very real position of her majesty the queen as part of those conferences when she goes there <e> <s> i am sure that was greatly welcomed by everybody concerned and i am sure that this house will wish to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i can say that the action group will consist of australia guyana <e> <s> india nigeria and zambia <e>", "<cs> my lords first on the point which the noble lord raised on the question of the economic summit my right honourable friend made perfectly clear to the conference that our position stoodon these matters where it was at the williamsburg summit and we could not accept any commitment to an international conference <e> <s> our position had been made clear before and was made clear throughout that that was the reason and it is fully consistent with the position we have persistently taken up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the right reverend prelate for what he has said <e> <s> i will certainly communicate his views as coming from the bishops bench to my right honourable friend and i know that she will he extremely grateful <e> <s> perhaps i might say in return that many of us notice that which the bishops of the church of england the anglican bishops do in the world to promote such dialogues and particularly the very wide travels of which i know he has taken another of the most reverend primate who has travelled much over the world and i am sure has done a great deal of good in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> perhaps i should begin with some general comments in answer to what they have both said and thereafter deal with the details <e> <s> as the noble lord lord cledwyn said the failure to make progress at athens was a setback and as the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> said it was unwelcome <e> <s> no one can deny that <e> <s> however perhaps it would be wrong to exaggerate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord home <e> <s> i think that it would be accepted in this house and by a very wide section of people in this country and all over the world that no one speaks with more authority on these matters than he does <e> <s> it is very welcome to be able to say to him yes the government totally agree with what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i do not think that i would wish to go the way of some of his expressions <e> <s> i do not accept that this disagreement which i have described as regrettable and indeed unfortunate is a lamentable defeat <e> <s> we did not lose anything <e> <s> if the words lamentable defeat mean anything to me they mean that we actually lost something and whatever else the fact of the matter is that we did not lose anything <e> <s> we did not gain anything and nor did anyone else <e> <s> the tragedy is that the community did not gain but it cannot be a lamentable defeat unless we lose something <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i think we would all agree that there is a good deal in what he says <e> <s> perhaps one of the tragedies of the position in athens was that a great deal of preparatory work which is what he requests had been done in the time leading up to the meeting <e> <s> probably one of the major tragedies was that when there was hope that that preparatory work was leading to a basis of agreement somehow in athens that basis of agreement disappeared again <e> <s> indeed that was probably the greatest damage of all <e> <s> my right honourable friend the foreign secretary and all my other colleagues will continue these negotiations as they have done before <e> <s> if your lordships knew how many of my colleagues appear to be permanently out of this country attending various meetings on this score you would be amazed at the amount of negotiating work that is taking place <e> <s> it must go on <e> <s> i hope that next time the ground work will have been laid and then advance will be made from the position when the prime ministers and leaders get together <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be unwise of me to follow someone of the noble lords great diplomatic eminence and skill in the advice he is giving to other countries <e> <s> i have no doubt that they should consider it <e> <s> i think they would take it better from him than perhaps they would take it from me and i do not think therefore that i would wish to proceed on that line <e> <s> regarding his remarks about my right honourable friend the prime minister it is exactly what i was saying to the noble lord lord molloy before at one moment she is said to be being beaten about the place and then the next moment too intransigent <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a great disappointment as my right honourable friend the prime minister has said <e> <s> that no progress was made on enlargement <e> <s> it is very unfair on the countries concerned that no agreement was made <e> <s> it was one of the disadvantages of no advance and still it is important that that goes forward as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can assure the noble lord briefly that this government are determined to play their full part and to take their full responsibility in the future for seeking to make the community work and to make any adjustments which are necessary to make sure that the community works for the good of europe and i believe for the good of the world <e> <s> that will be our purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i must simply i think note what the noble lord said <e> <s> it is certainly not our purpose to do that <e> <s> we are most anxious to show that in all these matters and i believe we have shown over a period of time we are wholehearted members of the community and are determined to make it work <e> <s> we have consistently said so <e> <s> this government made it clear at the time of the last election and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will be agreed that we have had a very remarkable debate <e> <s> we have had very nearly speakers <e> <s> in fact unless i spoil it by going on for too long now we shall have had speakers in about hours <e> <s> i think that your lordships will agree that this has been a very remarkable example and it is one that might he followed on some other occasions though to say that might be tempting fate too far <e>", "<cs> but he won more than he lost my lords <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway believes it to be the machinery of overt constitutional government and feels that we should go forward with the experiment <e> <s> my noble friend lord gridley is against it <e> <s> he has reservations about televising proceedings which perhaps can be answered so far as the activities of the bbc are concerned <e> <s> however he has some doubts because of the experience of sound broadcasting <e> <s> i hope that i have referred albeit briefly to most of the many points which your lordships have raised <e> <s> perhaps i may pick up one or two others as i come to give my final views on my own personal position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am too old a bird to be drawn or allowed to fly in the face of those sort of accusations on points of detail <e> <s> i am sticking firmly to the constitutional position which i set out <e> <s> i said i would represent the views in general of this house to my right honourable friends and that i will most certainly do <e> <s> i do not think it would be right or proper for me to be drawn any further into the details particularly as i know that the noble lord knows all the details and i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i must respond to the noble lord by saying that i will speak to my right honourable friends <e> <s> i do not think that i can give a guarantee to the noble lord but i will do my best to see what further help i can give to the house as regards this matter <e> <s> however as my noble friend has stated under our constitution as it stands the regulations come into force on st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for what the noble lord has very kindly said in his all too kind references to my efforts which will certainly continue and i shall do my best to serve this house at all times <e> <s> as for what he describes as a conflict there is of course a dual role <e> <s> whether i like it or not from time to time i am a member of the cabinet and a member of the government and i therefore defend all the governments policies all the time <e> <s> that is very proper and very right <e> <s> at the same time as doing that i am equally leader of this house and as such am responsible to members in all parts of this house <e> <s> i do not think there is a conflict <e> <s> if there is a conflict i can promise this house that i will always remember my duties to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am equally grateful for what the noble lord has said <e> <s> as regards the question of open or closed government i think it is very important that government are open <e> <s> i think that the danger towards overmuch secrecy has over the years in many governments gone a long way and i think that has to be watched <e> <s> but there are certain things <e> <s> after all whether it is in a government whether it is in a family or whether it is anywhere else we do not always want to parade to everybody else in the world everything that happens in our closed consultations <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will agree with me about that <e> <s> but equally i notice that whether the government like it or not a great many things that the government seem to be doing whether or not they wish to let them out get out whether i can do anything about them or not and i have to understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord gowrie explained in his recent letter to the noble baroness ministers from the departments of employment education and science and environment intend shortly to meet the local authority associations to discuss their concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> in the first place as i think she would agree many of these matters are properly to be discussed at the meeting which is being arranged <e> <s> i will certainly see to it that my right honourable friend and my noble friend know about these matters so that they are properly represented and that the noble baronesss very proper points are put at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> on the question of reimbursement to local authorities i am sure she will agree that that is a matter for discussion at the talks and i will certainly represent it <e> <s> so too is the proposed decrease in mode b schemes something that must be discussed and very carefully considered with the local authorities <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble baroness that it would be tragic if there were to be any withdrawal from the scheme <e> <s> it is important to remember that the guarantee of a place to all unemployed year-olds has been substantially <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness will agree that the first task was to make sure that the commitment to the year-olds was fully met <e> <s> as that commitment has been fully met what the noble baroness has said should certainly be considered <e> <s> i shall bring the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is very nearly though not quite a different question <e> <s> however i note exactly what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i said to the noble baroness lady seear that is an important point <e> <s> because i accept that it is an important point i shall make certain that it is put to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> whatever may be my power power backed by detailed knowledge is more valuable than power without it and i have to admit that my power is without detailed knowledge <e> <s> nevertheless i accept the point and everything shall be done to enlist the support of the local authorities for a scheme which depends very considerably upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question emphasises one of the great dangers of politics <e> <s> if you express sympathy for one group of people you nearly always leave out another <e> <s> therefore i shall express sympathy to all those concerned and say that we need the support of them all in order to make the scheme work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me whether i will consider all these matters <e> <s> the short answer to him is that i will not <e> <s> the reason i will not is that the political honours scrutiny committee composed of three very prominent members of this house does so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for translating it for me <e> <s> it always helps in my case <e> <s> i am sure that i agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly why i have not sought to draw any inference one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord for his very kind remark <e> <s> i always forget what you call somebody who is in limbo to the extent that mr macmillan now is <e> <s> but i think that he is mr macmillan and i am sure that there will come a time when this house will greatly welcome him here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very anxious never to make any suggestions to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be appropriate to leave it there <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that he is not impugning anyones good faith <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shackleton who did indeed ask me whether i would reply to this very important debate <e> <s> i said that my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth would present the governments case in full which he most certainly did and i am sure that the house is extremely grateful to him for doing so <e> <s> i said also that i would consider whether it would be possible for me to wind up the debate <e> <s> if the noble lord hoped that in doing so i should receive an eye-opener he was perfectly correct <e> <s> i have learned more in one day than i have learned on a great many other days in my ministerial career <e> <s> however as i started by knowing nothing perhaps it is only an example of what i should have know before <e> <s> as however the noble lord has used the occasion to advocate a further job for me i would say to him that recently i seem to have been attracting jobs though not always apparently carrying them out very successfully <e> <s> therefore i doubt whether i should take on any more <e> <s> however i note what the noble lord lord shackleton has said <e> <s> i assure him that i shall speak to my right honourable friend the prime minister about it on monday and will ask her to read the report of what i regard as having been an extremely important debate in this house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord says that it is not an original suggestion <e> <s> regarding helping towards power sharing i should point out that the opportunity for power sharing is available under the present assembly and under the present northern ireland act <e> <s> however much people like the noble lord lord fitt and i who were associated in a previous endeavour may regret it that failure is there and we have to accept it <e> <s> as for the proposal helping towards that end i have to point out to the noble lord that such proposals as he puts forward would of course create considerable constitutional problems particularly of collective responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> there are other people besides the noble lord and myself who would very much like to have seen the continuation of power sharing but that was not to be <e> <s> as for the position today i very much regret that the northern ireland parties in many cases have not seen their way to be able to take part in the assembly <e> <s> that is their decision and the noble lord is perfectly right <e> <s> as for the irish forum we shall have to see what comes out of that and the government will of course consider carefully what is said there <e>", "<cs> my lords i will consider that through the usual channels <e> <s> of course there are many opportunities for debate in this house and if i were to concede that point directly i would expect a certain <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with the noble lord on the need for security and indeed for prison security in northern ireland <e> <s> anyone who had my responsibilities there would do so <e> <s> equally i appreciate the problem of my right honourable friend the secretary of state in that there is need if we are to be successful in security to have some political progress and that is what my right honourable friend was seeking to do through the assembly <e> <s> i deeply regret that it has not succeeded and i hope that there may still be a chance that it will <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should be arousing expectations if i were to give that hope because it has to be faced that the problems of security in the north are paramount and must be so <e> <s> i do not wholly accept the argument about the recruitment of men of violence <e> <s> i believe that one must realise that there are people who will probably continue with violence whatever is done either in the north or the south of ireland <e> <s> i fear that that must be said because i feel it very deeply <e>", "<cs> mr lords i am grateful to the noble lord who has had considerable experience in northern ireland as i have <e> <s> anyone who has had any experience there and who holds out false hopes is a very unwise person indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was making was that it is up to my right honourable friend the prime minister to decide to whom she offers jobs in her government <e> <s> equally it is up to the individuals who are offered them to decide whether to accept them <e> <s> i think the ground of collective responsibility would make it very difficult for some of the people the noble lord proposes to accept those jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will respond to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> when i said in good time i hoped that that could be interpreted as being in reasonable time and in proper time before the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i respond at once to the noble baroness by saying that her request will he considered through the usual channels <e> <s> however i do not believe that she would expect me to give a commitment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords point <e> <s> i suggested to the house and i hoped he would agree that it would be reasonable to proceed to another question <e> <s> i hope that i have given the noble lord what the whole house might consider to be a very reasonable statement of the position and that we can let the matter rest there and pass to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for having treated this matter in what i feel is a suitably light-hearted vein <e> <s> as for what he says about the position of the right reverend prelates i have noticed that i am not alone among some of my <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> one of the advantages i have found in this house is that it is possible to reply to the views of the right reverend prelates which is not always possible on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not ask my honourable friend in what way he was speaking <e> <s> i merely read the words that he had said and i hope that they have been treated in a suitable manner this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i suppose it would be considered that i was in the main a right-wing politician whether that would be right or wrong i have noticed from time to time that right reverend prelates and other ministers of religion have not always been slow to criticise me <e> <s> i have taken it in good part and sometimes i have benefited from their criticism and i hope that i shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i frequently agree with the noble and learned lord and i certainly agree with him in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and the noble baroness for their questions and the points that they have put forward to me <e> <s> in view of the large number of points i think it would be best if i tried to seek to answer each of them in turn and if i overlap i hope that the house will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i think perhaps it is important to say that when one comes to the question of the cap we were prepared and ready to accept a per cent <e> <s> cut on the output of milk <e> <s> i think that this would be recognised by many noble lords who know our agricultural industry well to be a very considerable matter and one which would have been very difficult for our dairy farmers <e> <s> it has to be said that the irish government sought authority to continue increasing its milk production <e> <s> i think that such discrimination would have been extremely difficult for this country to accept <e> <s> it would have been an extremely difficult idea for anybody in this country to sell to our dairy farmers who i believe would have been perfectly prepared to accept the sort of restrictions that anyone else would have accepted <e> <s> but i do not believe that they would be prepared or should be asked to agree to something which is so totally discriminatory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord as i know will be my right honourable friend the prime minister who in fact this morning called my attention to the speech made by the noble lord in the debate in this house recently <e> <s> i did not actually need my attention called to it but i pretended that i did as i thought that was a wise action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would wish to bring too party political a controversy into this <e> <s> i would simply say this to the noble lord <e> <s> the benefit of hindsight is very valuable <e> <s> it is particularly valuable to the liberal party which over many years has not had the responsibility of forming a government in this country <e> <s> i quite understand that <e> <s> those who have had the responsibility of forming the government of this country sometimes have to admit their failures and errors <e> <s> those who have not can always use the benefit of hindsight without ever admitting that they have made any errors at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that i have to say and no doubt he will regret it as much as do many of us who believe in the political importance of the community and of its voice in the world that the meeting was so concerned with these particular financial problems that i do not believe that that matter was fully discussed <e> <s> i think that it is very important that we solve our financial problems so that once again we can in accordance with the hopes of many of us who supported this countrys going into the community at the start have a full voice in the affairs of the world and a much stronger voice together than we should have apart <e> <s> i still believe that that is crucially important <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord who has perhaps i could almost say an unrivalled experience in these very great and very difficult matters <e> <s> i am grateful for what he says <e> <s> i think it would perhaps be political for me at this stage to allow his comments on what the french government have done to rest in his mouth and not in mine <e> <s> he will understand the reason for that <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lords first point i am sure that what was said in the statement was factually correct <e> <s> certainly we did better in one year and the noble lord was perfectly correct than many people expected at the time but i do not think that that in any way changes the basis of the whole principle on which the finances of the community in the future are to be based as a result of this agreement <e> <s> i am sure he would agree with that <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point i can only say that i will take account of it <e> <s> in view of his important contribution to this government in the last parliament i will certainly make sure that his views are represented to my colleagues as is my duty <e> <s> on the second point about the control of spending and the agricultural problem i do not think i should be drawn too far down the road that the noble lord goes except to say that indeed the controlling of the cap is an essential part of controlling the expenditure of the community <e> <s> in the final event there can he nothing other than hard reality so far as that is concerned and i do not believe that solemn and binding assurances will mean anything unless they can be backed up by hard facts and that is part of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that i have made clear already in some of the other answers i have given the importance which her majestys government attach to the political solution and i have associated myself with that <e> <s> i note the importance of the reference he made to history and i accept much of what he says <e> <s> it makes it all the more important that we seek to solve sensibly the problems before us now otherwise we shall prejudice our efforts at political unity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are many people who will understand some of the feelings of frustration that the noble lord expresses after considerable years of experience as we all have in this matter <e> <s> i hope that the house will agree that it will be part of my job as a member of her majestys government and part of her majestys governments job to do everything possible to cool the situation and to try to see how we could advance sensibly to an agreement <e> <s> therefore i would not wish to indulge in any particular comments about the actions of other people and i think that would be correct <e> <s> of course it is important that we should examine the cap <e> <s> it is because we have failed so far during these discussions to get an agreement to a sensible solution to the problems of the cap that we are in this difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes these various assertions but i have made it clear first of all on some of the matters that were raised to do with the common agricultural policy that we were certainly not in a minority of one because that in itself leads to some of the other problems and it is quite unfair to suggest that this was all the others against the british government and i simply do not accept it <e> <s> as for these failures of british diplomacy all i can say to the noble lord is what i have said although perhaps it is not quite so fair to say it to him as it is to some of those who have never been in government that is of course it is much more difficult as i think the noble lord knew at the time to be in government with responsibility than it is with the benefit of hindsight to criticise from outside <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally extremely grateful to the noble viscount from his position for these remarks as i know my right honourable friend the prime minister will be <e> <s> there will be many arguments and i realise that there are arguments between some members of your lordships house <e> <s> i understand that perfectly fully <e> <s> but i hope that it will be recognised by everyone that we have a british position and we ought to stand up for our own interests other countries in the community do so and we would be failing our people if we did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can assure the noble lord that my right honourable friends resolve is very clear and very plain <e> <s> naturally she is disappointed at the failure to get an agreement because she believes in the future of the community and she very much hopes we can have an agreement in which this country will play its full part <e> <s> i think it is important for me to say to this house once again that that will be the purpose of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not quite sure what the noble lord with his unrivalled knowledge of this house and indeed of parliament was going to produce for me <e> <s> on his first point no i do not think i would be deterred by that fact particularly since it happened such a long time ago <e> <s> on the second point i think it is really a matter for parliament <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that this is a parliamentary anniversary and that is why my answer that it is for both houses of parliament to decide to put it forward and not the government is i think in the circumstances a proper one <e> <s> on whether it would coincide with a general election and whether we made sure that there was a peaceful transition from one government to another i would agree with the noble lord that our system of government and in fact the system of both houses of parliament and i say that quite advisedly is something of which this country has every reason to be proud <e>", "<cs> my lords the moment my noble friend lord blake rose i knew he was going to teach me something and there is a great deal of opportunity for him to do so <e> <s> had i looked at the excellent brief i have been given i would have known that fact for myself but i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for having pointed it out to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall leave the noble lord to speak for himself on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say in answer to the noble lord that if any such celebration did come from the views of both houses of parliament then i do not doubt that that spirit of reconciliation and understanding would certainly be there <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to celebrate the existence of the noble viscount i am sure that is something that this house would surely wish to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to come to the moment when i had to admit that i did get a degree in history at one stage but when i begin to hear the noble lord lord blake and the noble lord lord beloff i recognise that my degree in history is not of the standing of theirs <e> <s> curiously enough i concentrated at that time on the french revolution of which i remember absolutely nothing at all today <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i am very grateful for the fact that the noble and learned lord was speaking in english <e> <s> had he been speaking as the last welsh-speaking lord chancellor i certainly would not have understood what he was saying <e> <s> as regards the celebration of the recovery of the great seal again i think that would be a matter for parliament and it might very well be worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords this shows the wisdom of my suggestion that if we are to proceed in this matter it should be by the decision of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be correct for me to say as i am always encouraging my colleagues to do that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes certainly <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lords and to others who raised this matter <e> <s> it was one of the points on which i thought i might cut down for lack of time but i shall certainly write to the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i appreciate what he says and i have a good deal of sympathy with it <e> <s> the problem that arises is how to deal with the situation and how to improve it <e> <s> as what i may term a long-standing old boy of the usual channels in another place i do not think that i could possibly accept some of the noble lords criticisms of the usual channels because after all they seek to serve us to the best of their ability and frequently in very difficult circumstances <e> <s> i do not know what alternative measures they could find <e> <s> if there are two statements we try whenever possible to take them together and so not interrupt the debate more than once <e> <s> in fact we try in every way to seek to avoid these interruptions and we would wish to do so <e> <s> but i am afraid that if as the noble lord himself says there are to be repetitions of statements from another place it becomes almost inevitable that we have to interrupt our debates <e> <s> we shall do our best to improve as much as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i would pay close attention to what is said by the noble lord who has outstanding experience of all these matters <e> <s> we do our very best to help <e> <s> we offer all statements made in another place to the opposition parties to see <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord has his responsibilities in regard to this matter and i gratefully acknowledge the fact that he is most helpful <e> <s> it would be possible to do what he suggests <e> <s> but i think that if the house was to agree to that it would have to be appreciated that on occasions it might be quite late before all three statements could be made together and that might in itself have disadvantages <e> <s> but i am sure that that suggestion too can be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to tread on that extremely delicate area except to say this <e> <s> if there was in the government a minister with direct responsibility who is also a member of your lordships house and of course there is such a person i refer to my noble friend the minister for the arts who wished to make a statement he would of course initiate it here immediately after questions <e> <s> the rest of us do not have that kind of direct responsibility and i do not think that what is suggested would be welcomed in another place <e> <s> for example perhaps i may put it at its most personal and crudest i do not think that my right honourable friend the prime minister would fancy my making a statement here before she made it in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept at once what the noble lord says <e> <s> i was not in another place for as long as was the noble lord and compared with him i have been in your lordships house for <e>", "<cs> my lords if that was the wish of your lordships house it would of course be perfectly possible <e> <s> but i believe that it is frequently the wish certainly of the opposition that statements should be repeated and we have always been prepared in government to respond to that wish if it is expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely accept that the noble lord is quite correct in saying that but if he will allow me i will come to his single change when i have dealt with some of the broader changes because i think i will also have to say that that single change in itself would lead to many of the disagreements which have occurred in the past <e> <s> however those are the reasons why so far any efforts to change the composition of your lordships house have always failed <e> <s> they have always failed and until a new situation occurs i believe that they are likely to do so <e> <s> therefore on the broadest front i must and do go along with the noble lord lord jenkins in saying that it has to be either by revolution or by all-party agreement <e> <s> on the broader front there is neither at the present time and therefore i do not think that the basis for a major change exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i do not think the noble lord has any reason for disappointment or disillusionment <e> <s> he has to wait the result of the report and when the government announce it we shall see how we get on <e>", "<cs> yes my lords for the very simple reason that this is not the only review body that has produced a report for my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> surely she and the government are entitled to look at all these reports together and consider their interaction on each other <e>", "<cs> my lords the first answer to the noble lord is that the prime minister is not taking advantage of them quite the reverse <e> <s> some of the reasons many of which i do not necessarily endorse that the noble lord puts forward were major factors in the decision to offer a review body status to nurses and the professions allied to medicine <e> <s> that was done last year <e> <s> the review body report is being considered and it is reasonable for me to ask the noble lord to have the patience to see what attitude the government will take to it when it is announced <e>", "<cs> this whitsun my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord not least because he has actually endorsed something that i said <e> <s> i am always grateful when that happens <e> <s> i said that the government needed time to consider the ways in which the recommendations of these review bodies and other bodies would interact <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the powerful and emphatic support that he has given to my point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that it would be in accordance with all your lordships wishes if i were to express to one of my distinguished predecessors the noble lord lord peart our very great welcome on his return to the house after the very unhappy experience he has had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but the noble lord did say he had a -minute speech <e> <s> he has now taken minutes and i hope that he will have some regard for the many noble lords who want to speak after him in this short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lord will watch the time otherwise noble lords will be in great difficulty over this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the rules of our elections are well known to everyone <e> <s> we have if it is the right phrase played by these rules for a long time <e> <s> i believe in playing by the rules of a particular game so long as they are the rules of the game <e> <s> they are the rules of the game and i would keep them that way <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been the method of election in this country for a very long time <e> <s> i believe that on the whole it can be said to have stood <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may be right but the interesting thing is that everyone is keen to think about changes until someone produces some of the alternatives which they do not like so much <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason to suppose that that proposition is in any way correct <e>", "<cs> my lords having so recently come from another place i had better leave its members to express their views and not try to say what i think their views would be <e> <s> if i were to do that i would think that my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i made clear at the time and have always made clear since then and while i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said not by a long way does everyone think that what i did in northern ireland was correct i did that particularly as regards proportional representation because the situation in northern ireland is very different from that in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> i should add that it was not a full parliament that i was proposing should be elected in any sense of the word <e>", "<cs> my lords having so recently moved from a place where i had to survive the process of an election to a place where i do not i do not think i wish to return <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord as to the standing of this house and i am very proud that it should be so particularly as i happen to be its leader <e> <s> i am not always so proud when this house seeks to defeat the policies of the government of which i happen to be a member <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady seear for the questions they have raised <e> <s> first in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn the prime minister felt that it was important that she was able to raise the various points of criticism that this country had of the regime in south africa that she was able to explain in person to mr botha our very strong opposition to apartheid <e> <s> this she most certainly did in the strongest terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there is no doubt that the government believe that a dialogue of this sort with people in the world with whom we disagree is right and is important <e> <s> those who seek to suggest that such a dialogue should not take place will find it very difficult when they choose between where a dialogue should take place and where it should not <e> <s> that is a problem they have that we do not because we believe such a dialogue is right <e> <s> i do not think anyone in this country or indeed in this house would doubt that the prime minister would express her views with the utmost force <e> <s> i understand she most certainly did and if that is right i do not doubt for many of us will have had a similar experience from time to time that mr botha was left in absolutely no doubt as to what she felt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will understand if i repeat to the noble lord what i think i have already answered to other noble lords <e> <s> as he did not hear it it is perhaps important that i should do so <e> <s> on the first point the prime minister expressed considerable concern at mr mandelas continued detention <e> <s> as i replied to the noble lord lord cledwyn she pointed out to mr botha that mr mandelas release would be an important gesture of national reconciliation and i am sure the noble lord would endorse that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give information of the particular consultations that took place before this invitation was issued <e> <s> it was given on the authority of the prime minister and the british government and it was on that basis that it proceeded <e> <s> i believe that it will be seen in retrospect despite the many doubts that were expressed beforehand that a dialogue of this sort did on this occasion have value and i hope it will be seen to have some effect although we cannot yet see how much <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to be niggling on a small point of procedure but i understood that was correct <e> <s> of course i wish to respond to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i accept at once that there has been a major vote in this house perhaps it would be reasonable for me to say on both sides and i think the noble lord will have to accept that <e> <s> the noble lord and i have been on either side of a different house before and i have always understood and i had some responsibility for these matters that once one had a majority and a powerful majority which i must accept that it is that is something which means that one proceeds with the legislation in hand <e> <s> i do not think that anybody on any side of this house would expect me to say otherwise <e> <s> a substantial majority has been gained on a very high vote <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords think it is not a substantial majority that is up to them but i regard it as a substantial majority and i am entitled to my view so would my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and the noble baroness for their questions on this statement following the economic summit <e> <s> i am also grateful to both the noble lord and the noble baroness for accepting what they both described as the respectable aspirations of those who attended the economic summit <e> <s> i am sure that is right <e> <s> no one imagines that a short conference of a few days between economic leaders will solve the many problems of the world in detail <e> <s> i do not think anybody expects that and of course they did not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can have his little joke but there were some very important discussions and i think that the house would wish to recognise that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was not there i cannot say what discussions took place on the matters to which the noble lord referred but he has gone rather wide of the communiqu <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has suggested that i have been somewhat less than fair may i say to him that he is perhaps being somewhat less than fair in his suggestion that an economic summit attended by many different nations should be particularly concerned with the economic problems of this country <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to use the statement on the economic summit as a criticism of this governments economic policies <e> <s> that he is perfectly entitled to do though not necessarily on this occasion because i am dealing with a statement relating to the consideration by the governments of the western nations of these particular problems <e> <s> we played our part in those considerations <e> <s> i have shown how we sought to gain the co-operation of the other countries at the summit in order to achieve the economic progress which the noble lord wants to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to cross economic swords with the noble lord who in the past had considerable responsibility for many policies which were exactly the same as those which are being followed at present a matter about which he will be very well aware <e> <s> i do not have with me the details of many of the statements which he made so i cannot quote them to him at the moment but perhaps the noble lord will accept from me that in the past he said that if inflation is allowed to rise again and that if costs are allowed to rise again unemployment will not be reduced <e> <s> in fact jobs will be destroyed and the situation will be made worse <e> <s> that is what the noble lord said in the past <e> <s> i believe that he still believes this to be true today <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have been in any way unfair to the noble lord i regret it because i have no desire to be unfair to him <e> <s> nor do i have any desire to cross swords with him about official government aid <e> <s> these i admit freely are aspirations in the communiqu <e> <s> despite the criticisms which are frequently levelled at this government as they have been levelled at the aid programmes of previous governments i believe that if one looks at both the governments aid programme and at the aid given by industry all over the world britain has a very considerable record <e> <s> i regret that instead of accepting that this is the position we continue to run down what i believe to be a considerable contribution by our country <e>", "<cs> yes indeed i have an answer for the noble lord <e> <s> i was just coming to it but i will now come to it directly and give the other answer i was going to give him afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i appreciate what he says and i did not wish to be unreasonable <e> <s> but i think the question he is posing should be addressed to the energy department and not to the department of health and social security <e> <s> if he wishes to put down a question of that sort it will be answered in the normal way by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister about the european council in fontainebleau on th and th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> perhaps it would not be unreasonable to say that i am more grateful to the noble lord lord diamond for his contribution than i am to the noble lord lord cledwyn for his but they will not be surprised at that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think it would be correct for me to reply to my noble friend lord thorneycroft first <e> <s> i will seek to answer the noble lord lord barnett afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord may i say first that it has been made perfectly clear <e> <s> the statement said <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords that is part of the agreement but it is also a part of the agreement that the finance ministers will deal with budget discipline <e> <s> the noble lord may not think they will but it is clear from the statement that that is the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said about the negotations and about the deal which has been achieved <e> <s> on the question of own resources the statement says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what

the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> we have throughout said that the important reason for settling the budget problem i would not describe it as a book-keeping wrangle is that i do not think

offer and would not have happened <e> <s> at the same time if one is critical of the deal one cannot at the same time refer to it although i do not think the noble lord did this as a book-keeping wrangle <e> <s> it is certainly more than that and considerable sums of money are involved <e> <s> as for the science and technological developments certainly these are matters which are now open to the community to pursue with more vigour than many people have felt has been done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the answer to the noble lords point about the constitutional changes to the agricultural policy <e> <s> if he means that we will continue to work to change the basis of the common agriculture policy the answer is yes <e> <s> i am just doubtful about the word constitutional but on the face of it yes <e>", "<cs> i ought to say that i have put it exactly the opposite way round it should be exactly the reverse of what i said <e> <s> it is like one of those great things in life which is always so good it comes to exactly the same conclusion in the end <e> <s> but my noble friend should withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most anxious to help and <e>

noble lord and to my noble friend lord alport that i have spoken and i think that it is reasonable for me to say this to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment and i can say categorically to this committee with all the authority that i command and i suppose that i command a certain amount that in fact no decision has been taken as to the future at all <e> <s> if i may say so i should have thought that any noble lord who thinks that i would consent in any way to take a decision about something which was going to happen in the future about an hour after an event such

pressurised aircraft will be obtained by mid-february <e> <s> if these dates are met that would mean a considerable reassurance to everyone <e> <s> those are the aims at the moment and we must all hope that they will be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i agree in principle with what my noble friend said <e> <s> when i said that the government would be extremely cautious i meant that <e>

extremely cautious <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement which i felt it right to make even though of course it is somewhat exceptional because

cannot accept the word capitulation <e> <s> if i were to accept the word capitulation it would mean that i as leader of this house and certainly as a member of the cabinet took the view that on no

may i say that i believe your lordships are <e>", "<cs> when i announced in this house the change that the government proposed to make in relation to elections to the greater london council and the

lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> in the circumstances it would be wrong for me to comment either way on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no more than commit myself to the noble lord lord diamond and to the fact that there will inevitably be a statement at that stage <e> <s> i expect that it will be at least a statement though probably it will amount to considerably more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will appreciate that while the judge found in favour of the government on four of the five counts he did not find in favour of them in fact he found against them on the lack of prior consultation with the unions concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong of me to reply to that except to say that i cannot imagine any government that i have ever been in not taking some legal advice on all their actions very properly from their law officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i recognise at once the importance of the subject that she has raised and i recognise too the importance that this house should be fully involved in this particular subject <e> <s> i understand that it is likely that in another place during consideration of the consolidated fund bill on wednesday there will be such a debate <e> <s> that is entirely a matter for the other place and they will make their decision as to whether or not they have it <e> <s> for our part i understand that an unstarred question is to be asked today week when this subject will certainly be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the committee for their report which speaking on behalf of this government i am happy to accept <e> <s> your lordships will understand that i am in no position to commit our successors <e> <s> your

lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede for raising this issue which i agree with him is important <e> <s> he will appreciate that there are problems as he said at the end in dealing with the matter in this particular bill <e> <s> he has also of course correctly anticipated some of the arguments i am going to use <e> <s> that will not stop me from using them briefly but he has anticipated them quite rightly and quite properly <e> <s> equally we have to face some of the harsh realities <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede for raising this issue <e> <s> he makes a persuasive case but i hope i can show him that i have equally good reasons for disappointing him <e> <s> there is a separate pension scheme for united kingdom members of the european assembly which follows closely the provisions of the parliamentary scheme <e> <s> both schemes will incorporate the improvements already in the bill including the early retirement provision <e> <s> it will continue to be possible to transfer service from one scheme to the other for the calculation of normal pension benefits or if the individual prefers to draw two separate pensions relating to different periods of service in strasbourg and in westminster <e>", "<cs> it would be ungracious indeed after the noble lords remarkable explanation of something of which i had not the smallest idea if i did not respond to him appropriately and say that of course that is exactly what we will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to this motion <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn of course as soon as the new rates are available they will be immediately brought into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood particularly since it enables me to put right a failure in replying to the noble lord lord diamond on what would happen if there were to be variations from the present expenses levels <e> <s> that of course could always be debated at any time your lordships wished and we could come forward with it <e> <s> some proposals of course such as the one mentioned by the noble baroness lady elliot would have to be referred to the top salaries review body at their next review and we could see how we got on at that stage <e> <s> i am bound to say to the noble baroness and to the house that when i first became a member of parliament in another place in there were many years during which my wife had no means of coming to london from cumbria which being just over the border is after all very nearly as far as the noble baroness has to travel <e> <s> so i am basically very sympathetic to that particular point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the noble lord is seeking to get me into paths of argument which i do not wish to come into on this particular occasion <e> <s> i think i would have to say to him that it would be up to noble lords themselves to decide how they would wish to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer first to my noble friend lord bessborough i understand that it is possible to spread the days over if he understands my meaning <e> <s> i have had some consultations with the chief whip <e> <s> if i have not made it clear perhaps my noble friend had better approach the chief whip and i together and i will try to make it clearer thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i was of course expressing a personal view and i should be very glad to discuss that particular personal view with my colleagues although of course i could not commit the government in any way <e> <s> perhaps i might make one point clear which would emphasise the difficulties attaching to this <e> <s> office-holders and ministers of this house have been given a number of passes for their wives but unlike members of another place we have had to pay full rates of tax on these passes for our wives <e> <s> your lordships will realise that does diminish the value of the passes fairly considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for all the points they have made <e> <s> first i believe it would be right to confirm that i have discussed our position on this side of the house with my noble friend the chief whip and we will of course follow exactly the same procedure as the other parties and have a totally free vote <e> <s> therefore anything that i say is not in any way meant to persuade my noble friends to support me if they feel otherwise <e> <s> i should like to make that absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords it was simply that the arrangements put forward for members in another place and which we were seeking to copy here were based on proposals made by my noble friend lord peyton and his committee <e> <s> there are inevitably many different comparisons which can be made and the noble lord very properly makes yet another one <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly your lordships decision on the other amendments raises questions for this one as well <e> <s> at this stage i should like to suggest to the noble lord lord tordoff that the arrangements that have been made so far as mileage is concerned are slightly important from the point of view of trying to make reasonable recompense for the actual costs involved <e> <s> the arrangement affects that <e> <s> for that reason i should prefer to leave the matter as it stands naturally having accepted what has been done on the other amendments <e> <s> if having done that i have a chance to look into the matter against the background of the other decisions i am perfectly prepared to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord ferrier has asked about the arrangements for peers who are unable to drive their own cars and have to hire a car <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him that in july last year the house agreed that members of this house who are disabled should be able to recover additional expenses for attendance at this house incurred by them on account of their disablement <e> <s> these additional expenses in hiring a car can therefore subject to the discretion of the leave of absence and lords expenses committee be met under the existing rules <e> <s> i believe that they are now and they certainly will be in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lady lady saltoun and my noble friend of course this matter can he looked into again by the leave of absence and lords expenses committee and i will undertake that it should be <e> <s> i believe that the matter has been looked at before and did not find favour on that occasion but that does not mean that it cannot be looked at again and that will certainly be done <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will appreciate an individual trade unionist can contract out of the political levy and the present trade union bill contains provisions for a decennial ballot of a unions membership on whether or not the union should retain its political fund <e> <s> company shareholders for their part have freedom of choice in their investment and they can make their views known by the choice of the companies in which they invest <e>", "<cs> my lords i have stated as i think the noble lord will appreciate the position so far as trade union members are concerned perfectly plainly and i have done the same so far as company shareholders are concerned <e> <s> in my past incarnation in another place i have had frequent discussions on state aid to political parties and i can only say to the noble lord that those proposals too cause considerable difficulties and considerable problems <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not i am a distinguished member of this government i do not think i can give any such assurance in respect of any government as to any trade union bill in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords everything the noble lord has just said has made me even surer that the difference between a trade union member and a shareholder in a company is very great indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords he could do that no doubt but of course you have to take into account the fact that he might be paying through his taxes for state aid to parties when he did not want to pay anything to any of them at all <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they are and both are able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that they can go to the annual general meetings of their companies and get up a complaint if they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand naturally what the noble lord says but i do not happen to agree with it nor do i believe that it will prove to be correct in the long run <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn the leader of the opposition and to the noble baroness lady seear the leader of the liberal party for what they have said <e> <s> in general terms i hope that they would feel it right for me to say to them that their support their sympathy and their encouragement this afternoon must re-emphasise what i have said that those who perpetrate such actions will meet with the implacable hostility of a united parliament and people together with the government <e> <s> that at this particular moment is a great encouragement to my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> i am if i may say so on her behalf and on behalf of the government very grateful to the noble lord and to the noble baroness for what they have said <e> <s> may i also thank them for what they have said about the work of the services concerned <e> <s> i am grateful for their words of commendation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that the inquiry will be conducted by the deputy chief constable of hampshire in sussex taking all the evidence of what happened in brighton <e> <s> that is his purpose <e> <s> i think that it is right the noble lord will i think agree that it is right that a senior officer from another force should be charged with that particular inquiry <e> <s> that is the first step <e> <s> i think that i would answer the noble lord by saying that it is the first step <e> <s> of course i shall without any commitment at this stage report to my right honourable friends

grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> from now on i am sure that the house will agree that i should confine myself to answering the specific questions put to me <e> <s> regarding the noble lords two points first so far as trident expenditure crowding out conventional forces is concerned i think i should simply say that the government remain totally committed to our conventional forces as part of

america <e> <s> it would be very damaging i believe both to europe and to america and to the whole free world in the long run <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> on his first

lords the noble lord will know very well that i do not agree with him and therefore the answer to his question must be no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the contribution and the affirmation by the noble viscount of his continued support for this government <e> <s> so far as being satisfied is concerned i do not think that anyone who has been a minister for it seems as long as

improvising some answer which may subsequently be proved wrong the worst of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i respond of course to the noble lord the leader of the opposition by saying that this can certainly be done <e> <s> i hope it will be found that this procedure works <e> <s> if so perhaps it may continue happily and be accepted <e> <s> if it does not seem to be working it is of course possible for the committee of procedure to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i have consulted the librarian <e> <s> i understand that letters will be placed in a series of deposited papers held in the library <e> <s> this should make it comparatively easy for the library staff to identify any particular letter <e> <s> that is the purpose of this procedure and i hope that it will work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious not to become a vehicle for a vast distribution of papers in all parts of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e> <s> i do not know where deposited papers go in the library any more than does the noble lord <e> <s> if i wished to find out i would ask the librarian and i hope receive a satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think on reflection that i should quite go along with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am here as leader of your lordships house to serve your lordships <e> <s> i decided that this matter did not fall within the criteria normally applied to private notice questions and therefore i ruled that it should not be permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister about the anglo-irish summit on th and th november <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord diamond for their response to the statement <e> <s> i am grateful too for the welcome given to the tone of the statement and to the nature of the very full and frank discussion which clearly took place and which was emphasised throughout the statement <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord diamond who associated himself with those particular points of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i will not go through the various points of history with him except to say that if one has spent as i did nearly two years of ones life in northern ireland there is nothing that one has not heard about the history of northern ireland from all the many people who spoke to one over that period of time <e> <s> so i would confirm much of what he has said about the immense problems that attend this particular position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and particularly for her last remark <e> <s> i am sure that everyone in your lordships house would clearly agree <e> <s> the problem is how to make this progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i agree with him <e> <s> clearly security is much wider than the situation on the border <e> <s> equally clearly the situation on the border is crucially important to both states and to the security of both states <e> <s> as the noble lord has referred to security he enables me to repair another omission and that is to thank the noble lord lord diamond very much for the kind remarks he made about my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must say in answer to the noble lord that i have been in politics for perhaps too long and involved in irish politics perhaps too long but at least it gives me one advantage <e> <s> i know it would be very wrong of me to enlarge on what is said in the communiqu at this time and i do not think i would wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be agreed by all the noble lords who have attended this debate that we have had a very important debate with many speeches of considerable quality from both points of view <e> <s> of course if i found some of them more acceptable than others that is only because of my own very well-known views on the subject <e> <s> i have never yet learned to admire a speech which was against my views more than i admired one which was in favour of them and i do not think that many of your lordships have either <e> <s> so to that extent i would say we have had a very important debate on what is after all a very important subject for this house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> indeed i could go further and say that everything i am saying refers to the experimental period alone because i would have no authority to do otherwise and if i did this house would be rightly extremely suspicious of what i was up to <e> <s> i do not wish it to do that in any way because i am not actually up to anything except to advocate the chance of an experiment that is all that it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that your lordships could express an opinion on the matter but i have to say that in this debate as i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can fairly say to my noble friend that that is one of the purposes of the motion which i have just moved <e> <s> of course it is couched in very correct language because it suggests that the initiative should be wholly with the committee of selection <e> <s> but the committee of selection has been left in no doubt that it would be helpful from the point of view of the house if some of those appointed might be those who voted against the motion in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i am competent to argue on those various complicated matters of insurance that might arise except to say that the committee will of course for the convenience of your lordships consider all the matters that arise during the experimental period <e> <s> however i should also say to the noble lord that at the same time there will be a certain presumption that noble lords who are reasonable at all times will be able to look after themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the committee will be well appraised of that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the european council of rdth december which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the welcome which they have given the statement and particularly for their welcome of the fact that there was a considerable area of agreement at the summit perhaps in marked contrast to some previous ones and therefore all the more welcome for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his question <e> <s> the budget abatement system agreed at fontainebleau is due to come into effect in <e> <s> the community is also committed by the fontainebleau conclusions to the introduction of new own resources no later than st january <e> <s> we therefore expect the new own resources decision to be adopted in time to allow these commitments to be met <e> <s> in the meantime the council recently affirmed its commitment to make available to the united kingdom million ecus or million in respect of on the revenue side of the budget in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be in the spirit of the agreement recently reached in dublin on many other matters if i were to respond to the noble lords last point <e> <s> however on the other matter i think that the united kingdom governments approach in negotiations to safeguard our fishing position has been one from which we can at least take some satisfaction although one can never be completely satisfied <e> <s> as i said these negotiations are bound to be continuing and i can assure the noble lord that our position will be very carefully safeguarded in these future discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture will announce the details of this particular agreement in the near future <e> <s> i cannot give the details now but i shall make sure that my right honourable friend gives them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i cannot give any definite answer as to how the discussions will go tomorrow <e> <s> i think so far as we are concerned we feel that particularly in air pollution we have a good record <e> <s> we are opposed to mandatory reductions at arbitrary levels given continued uncertainty about both causes and effects of different pollutions <e> <s> at the same time we aim for still further reductions in sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by per cent <e> <s> from levels by the end of the s <e> <s> i think it can be said that in all these fields we are taking a considerable part and giving a considerable lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can help the noble lord by elaborating because of course the noble lord will appreciate that i was not there at the discussions <e> <s> i can only report what was said in the statement that these matters were discussed and that considerable thought was given to how some of the i agree generalised objectives could be met <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord any further detail as to how that is to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be unwise for me to give any such undertaking <e> <s> i can say only that the agreement that was achieved on limiting the communitys commitments and on limiting agricultural expenditure must be a step in the right direction <e> <s> we hope that it will lead to no further demands such as have been made this year but i could not possibly yet say whether the measures taken will necessarily have that desirable effect <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i should say that i feel it is my duty always to be as courteous as possible at all times <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend preached this sermon in his private capacity as an elected member of the church of england general synod <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises two points <e> <s> the first concerns what my honourable friend actually said <e> <s> in view of the fact that he was speaking in a private capacity and the government have no responsibility for what he said i shall suggest that my noble friend sends a copy of his speech to the noble lord <e> <s> i have read it and i do not think that many of the constructions put on it by the noble lord are borne out <e> <s> he can judge for himself and i shall make sure that my honourable friend sends him a copy of the speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not noticed that they had got away scot free <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should simply briefly reply that the government have to expect many people in many different capacities in our national life to criticise them and they would not be here for very long if they were not prepared to accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i only answer the noble lords question which i think is somewhat outside the scope of the original question merely to say that most certainly the efforts that the churches made in ethiopia have been highly commendable as have the efforts i hope the noble lord will also agree which have been made by her majestys government both in this country and within the community where considerable amounts of aid have gone to ethiopia through the help and work of the prime minister and the british government <e>", "<cs> i hope very often my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> i thought of doing that but i have to tell noble lords that i would have had just as much difficulty in trying to curtail some of the earlier ones as i did in curtailing the last one <e> <s> i try to give as much latitude as is at all possible to the house <e> <s> but when we have taken minutes i am sure that the noble lord who after all had considerable responsiblity in these matters at one time will realise that enough can be enough and if the house feels it it is my job so to interpret it <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately there is an error in the terms of the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> it provides for standing order be dispensed with today for the purposes of taking the consolidated fund bill through all its stages when in fact it is proposed that the bill should be taken through all its stages tomorrow <e> <s> with the leave of the house i beg to move the motion with the substitution of tomorrow for this day <e>", "<cs> my lords i have found my time as leader of your lordships house humiliating humbling very instructive and indeed extremely enjoyable and i am prepared to admit all that <e> <s> this afternoon has been no exception <e> <s> i had begun to think that what was described by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge quite rightly as a somewhat off-the-cuff remark that i made before really was unwise <e> <s> i still think that it was actually unwise and am prepared to admit it but i am now rather pleased that i made it even if it was unwise because it enabled the noble lord lord houghton to initiate this excellent debate today and enabled some noble lords to educate me further <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall pay attention to what the noble lord <e> <s> lord shackleton has said and i shall consider it with my colleagues <e> <s> the pressure on legislative time is very considerable but if that were felt in this house and i could get my colleagues agreement and it could be done quickly and sensibly it might be a way out of the problem <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will agree with me that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords we all had our part to play in that particular failure <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord dunleath <e> <s> said that he was the only member of your lordships house who had a parliamentary constituency <e> <s> that is not strictly correct <e> <s> my noble friends lord ohagan lord bethell and lady elles all of course have parliamentary constituencies in that they are members of the european parliament <e> <s> i do not know under what category he would regard my arrival here whether as a troublesome politician in another place <e> <s> i do not think it can be quite so <e> <s> if it had been so i suppose that my right honourable friend the prime minister would not actually have kept me in her cabinet on that basis so there must have been some other purpose for which she decided to send me here <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that yesterday i was enjoined by members of the noble lords own party to cut down on the amount of time that is taken at question time <e> <s> i have sought to do so at the first opportunity as i think the noble lord and <e>", "<cs> my lords the retirement of sir david house is a sad occasion for me and indeed for all of your lordships <e> <s> but i am delighted that it is my privilege to pay tribute to sir davids outstanding service to the house during his seven years as gentleman usher of the black rod <e> <s> the duties of black rod are to say the least diverse <e> <s> i am told that the office can be traced back to the th century when it was black rods duty to carry his rod in processions of the knights of the garter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness the leader of the liberal party <e> <s> i think this is a matter which the house will very seriously have to consider <e> <s> patience is a great virtue i know but my patience this afternoon with this particular very important question has probably gone beyond the bounds of what the house intended and what the procedure committee intended when it set down the time for questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think from the noises that i hear from behind me and in front of me and on every side of me that i should be interpreting the views of the house correctly if i suggested that this very important question has had a good run and that we should now pass to the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an historic debate in your lordships house <e> <s> for the first time a very large number of people have had the opportunity to listen to and watch the proceedings from their own homes <e> <s> no doubt we shall be told how many actually decided to do so <e> <s> equally there will be much argument about the value of televising your lordships house <e> <s> but surely few will dispute that the views and opposing arguments of noble lords who have taken part in the debate were worthy of a wide audience <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will not mind if i say that i do not think he should have a second innings today and i think it would be reasonable if we brought these questions to an end now <e> <s> they have gone on for a considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement concerning the interception of communications which is at present being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon who thanked me for honouring the undertaking that i gave during the passage of the telecommunications bill <e> <s> that was generous of him and i appreciate it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for the welcome that he gave to the proposals which we are putting forward <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a part of my duties so to do and i suggest to the noble lord that there are many ways in which he may raise this matter but now is not the occasion for one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have made it clear to the house that there are occasions when such matters can be raised <e> <s> i think the noble lord will have heard what i said and i stand by it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is i think a question for me to answer if i may say so to the noble baroness <e> <s> the answer is that there will be leaks no doubt in newspapers over a long time <e> <s> we have a long way to go with this review and the noble baroness will read of many more leaks <e> <s> where they come from is for her to judge not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords the best of all possible reasons that i can give the noble lord for not being able to tell him how much the treasury contributes to this house is that i do not know <e> <s> i do not know for the best of all possible reasons that i am not supposed to know because it is for the parties themselves to decide what they give to this house for their parties in this house to conduct their business <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not underestimate the capacity of the noble lord to start a party on his own and to attract considerable support <e> <s> however he would have to win the votes at a general election and gain some seats <e> <s> if he won neither seats nor votes he would not get any money <e> <s> i suspect that the noble lord would get both votes and seats and probably receive some money but he will have to wait for the next general election before he does that <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly recognise the part which the noble lord lord glenamara when his name was different played in another place in what i believe to be a reasonable arrangement for the work of the parties both in another place and in this house <e> <s> i was of course associated with the noble lord in that particular endeavour at that time and indeed belonged to a party that was a recipient of some of the money for which contrary to what might sometimes be said at that time we were extremely grateful <e> <s> it helped us to conduct our business in another place as it did other parties <e> <s> i believe that it is a reasonable arrangement and that it makes sense <e> <s> as to how this house is served i must continue to say that that is a matter for the parties themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i spend my time trying to curtail the length of questions in this house <e> <s> i constantly remind my colleagues on the front bench that they should not answer questions which are outside the remit of the original question <e> <s> the question that i was originally asked explicitly said <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and in my simple way i perhaps regarded the words <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i am also grateful for the kind but limited messages of congratulation to the prime minister <e> <s> they were kind but limited in the case of the noble lord lord cledwyn who said he was pleased that she was well received to which i reply that with a performance such as she gave no wonder she was well received <e> <s> but that is for me to say and i can understand why the noble lord lord cledwyn did not say it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for what he has said particularly for his kind remarks about my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> as one would expect he states totally correctly the position about research and development and their relationship to the disarmament negotiations <e> <s> in stressing that he has perhaps repaired an omission in my original reply to the other two noble lords if i did not refer to that aspect sufficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am right in saying to the noble lord that of course my right honourable friend referred to the agreement at camp david and felt that what was being discussed and what was being said followed through clearly from what had been agreed at camp david <e> <s> as to the participation of this country in the research involved i think that my right honourable friend made it perfectly clear that this was something which we were very well prepared to do and which we should like to do <e> <s> of course the details of exactly how that can be done will clearly have to be worked out further on <e> <s> but that was her view <e> <s> i do not see why it should lead to a brain drain as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i do not think that i can go beyond what was said in the terms of the communiqu that both my right honourable friend and the president expressed their support for king husseins endeavours to arrive at a common position among moderate arab governments and welcomed the result of king fands recent visit to washington <e> <s> of course that support and that welcome cover some clear arguments which have been conducted on the exact way in which such a settlement could be reached <e> <s> but i think that both recognised that it was through supporting moderate elements in the middle east that the best hope lay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for what he said about my right honourable friends speech to congress <e> <s> on his point about the middle east and the initiative of the egyptian prime minister i think that it would be wrong for me as i am not fully informed to go anywhere beyond the communiqu which was set out at the end of my right honourable friends visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot enlighten the noble lord on that <e> <s> i think that i must stick to the terms of the communiqu <e> <s> on the position so far as northern ireland is concerned i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said <e> <s> i think that it was very important that the prime minister got that message very plainly across <e>", "<cs> my lords while i understand very much what the noble lord says and respect his point of view i think that it would be wrong for me to go any further or to get committed any deeper than the communiqu <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate i have of course a little knowledge of what the prime minister said to the president but not a great deal and some of what i have i obviously should not communicate publicly <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect to the noble lord i do not think that i quite said what he interpreted i had said <e> <s> in truth i believe i said that of course how we were to co-operate in research and the research side of it would necessarily be a matter of discussion and negotiation between the two governments <e> <s> i did not say that the whole question of the handling of the disarmament negotiations on which of course there have been discussions between the two governments would necessarily be a matter for further negotiation <e> <s> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> oh yes my lords that most certainly is the position <e> <s> that of course was in the communiqu <e> <s> on that i can certainly assure the noble lord <e> <s> the whole question will be part of the very serious negotiations <e> <s> that was made perfectly clear in the communiqu <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> as the labour party did my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and to the noble baroness lady seear for their comments on the statement <e> <s> both the

raises about publishing various figures of course i shall consult with my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer but if the statement made by my right honourable friend the prime minister says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord tut tuts but the fact of the matter is that a detailed question about qualified voting and all the rest is of course a trick question and i have been long enough in this game not to respond to trick questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my noble friend who is a great expert in these matters is quite correct <e> <s> that is the position as i understand it and it has certainly been reinforced by my noble friends statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i can best satisfy him by repeating what the statement said about the strength of technology <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point that the noble lord made i said that i would discuss with my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer whether it was necessary to publish any more <e> <s> it is fair to say that if the statement says in categoric terms that that is the position quite frankly it is the position <e> <s> i shall read it again <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be fair if i told the noble lord why there is some impatience <e> <s> i think it is felt that it is not normal for the person who opens the debate at the start to make a long speech at the end <e> <s> it is normally a very short speech thanking those who have taken part in the debate and not another winding-up speech

one of my predecessors as leader of this house but i am informed by my noble friend the chief whip that on those occasions when that has been tried it has not proved satisfactory to the house and

very generous mood i gave the noble lord the opportunity to ask his next question but it was against my better judgment <e> <s> my better judgment would have been to stop him beforehand <e> <s> i allowed him to go on and having allowed him to do so i really do not think that i should allow him to go on any more <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the noble lord will read the report of the debate last thursday as a whole he will find that the decision of the house was that there was no automatic right for a member to have a second question <e> <s> i think that that was clearly expressed

diamond for their reactions to the statement <e> <s> in view of the many comments they both properly made it will be easiest for me to reply to them separately <e> <s> i will do that simply because

all the more because of course however long any other noble lord might take in saying things the noble lord will still be able to ask his question and most certainly will do so <e> <s> the answer i believe as far as the french are concerned is bound up particularly with the case of french agriculture and especially with the common agricultural policy in the community <e> <s> as the noble lord will probably appreciate there are still discussions alas <e> <s> not so far leading to agreement on the agricultural settlement within the common agricultural policy for the next year and the french not necessarily in that regard but certainly as far as french agriculture is concerned are very dubious as to whether they can take part in the gatt discussions for that reason <e> <s> it is french agriculture that is at the root of the problem and added to that is the problem of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and if he will understand i shall be very cautious in the exact terms of the response i give at this present moment because i would not wish to prove him right and myself wrong on some answer that i may give <e> <s> therefore i would say that i could not give him a specific answer but i will certainly seek to do so on exactly what the government have achieved in real terms in relation to meeting the communiqu on the last occasion

african countries <e> <s> i know it can always be argued that it is possible to do more but it would be very unfair to this country not to recognise the very considerable contribution both from the government and from private individuals that has been made to famine relief in africa <e> <s> i am sure that that should be recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure that with his great experience he in his time has attended many summit meetings of one kind or another which expressed hopes for the future and did not necessarily produce results at that moment

think that with the great drug menace that affects the whole world and which it would be very unwise to imagine is not likely to get worse rather than better in the immediate future it was right that

countries of the summit <e> <s> it is their consideration and i have nothing further to add to the views of the great experts who were all there <e>", "<cs> no is the answer to that quite firmly <e>

say that at present the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on security which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to the noble baroness lady seear for their comments on this statement <e> <s> first i should say to the noble lord lord cledwyn that the government my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable friend the home secretary all fully accept the very serious nature of the criticisms in this report and we are all determined to make sure that everything is done to put this right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> from my own limited experience though i suppose that four years is some time i strongly confirm what he has said <e> <s> i think perhaps it would be best for me to quote again to the house what the commission said in their report because it bears entirely on what my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon who has certainly on these matters always adopted a most responsible attitude <e> <s> indeed there was disquiet and the other disclosures together with this one naturally have led to anxieties <e> <s> on the question as to whether the quinquennial review is sufficiently frequent i must say that it would be a matter in the first instance for the director general to report about that to my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable and learned friend the home secretary and then for that particular point as indeed with the others on which he will report to be considered most carefully by them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate and i thank them for the generous things that have been said about me personally <e> <s> i came to the conclusion that while i enjoy these very much indeed when they come if rarely i am only too well aware when some of them are perhaps rather more generous and kindly than they ought to be <e> <s> in this case i felt rather like that <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning was as usual totally correct <e> <s> the fact worried me yet again that noble lords and judges of his distinction can look so plainly into the minds of simple people like me and know exactly what we are thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord diamond for their response to the statement <e> <s> perhaps i should say at the start to the noble lord lord diamond that i am sure my noble friends on this side of the house would like to be associated with what he said about his noble friend lord george-brown <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> first i think that i should make it clear that my right honourable friend the prime minister met the various authorities mentioned in the statement <e> <s> i was not present on that occasion <e> <s> indeed i have to admit to the house that i was far from london at the time <e> <s> i have to give the views as i know them but i was not present and did not hear them personally <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords i read the letter <e> <s> i would only add that of course the government will pay considerable attention to what is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i know how sad the football association felt this was certainly expressed by the chairman for the norwich city football club in the predicament in which it has found itself as a result of the ban on playing in europe <e> <s> the right reverend prelate has expressed very plainly and very significantly how particularly sad this is for a club and indeed for supporters who have had such a good record with those against whom they have played <e> <s> he has told us this very plainly <e> <s> it makes it all the more sad that they have been to some extent the losers arising from the action of others but that is i am afraid inevitable sometimes in life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness who has a distinguished record in sporting activities over many years <e> <s> i shall be only too pleased to pass on her remarks to my right honourable friend the prime minister who will i know be very pleased to receive them <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble baroness very much for what she has said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps having noted the views put forward by your lordships i should say to my noble friend that in fact private notice questions are offered to the opposition through the usual channels in the normal way <e> <s> frequently they are thought to be important and frequently i must say they are important-i have to say possibly rather more important perhaps than this particular one that we are discussing this afternoon <e> <s> therefore on that basis if the opposition want them it has been the habit of the government to make sure that they have them <e> <s> having heard the debate i am sure that the house would wish to have this statement today <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble earl lord perth for what he has said <e> <s> we shall have the statement today and i am sure that in future the usual channels on all sides will take careful note of what has been said this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords for their reception of these amendments which i am grateful they recognise to have been a genuine effort on the part of the government to meet a problem <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> i should like to say at once that i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that we have an opportunity to consider in a calm atmosphere some very important matters <e> <s> the speeches that have already been made show how important it is that we should be able to do just that in regard to some very difficult questions <e> <s> i should also like to say to the noble lord that his account as a preface to the events leading to the introduction of the bill was to my knowledge and i had some part in that from many different points of view very correct and very proper <e>", "<cs> once again i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for having raised an important matter <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble and <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lords who have raised an important matter somewhat away from what we have been discussing previously concerning the basis on which the warrants are issued and how we define the very important word necessary or whether we qualify it in any way at all <e>", "<cs> i think that i can explain to the noble lord lord mishcon and to the noble and learned lord lord denning some of the problems involved in this amendment <e> <s> of course it goes again to the heart of the exercise of the warrant system and it is therefore extremely important <e> <s> i think i shall be able though i am not sure to convince your lordships that the amendment as suggested would have some undesirable consequences <e> <s> if i take a little time to explain these it is only because i am seeking to make clear why something that sounds on the face of it so reasonable and sensible may be either not necessary or not really desirable <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord who moved his amendment very shortly and very clearly <e> <s> perhaps it would be appropriate nevertheless if in seeking to meet his point i go through some points of clause which i think it is proper for me to put on the record <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising these important matters about the position of the tribunal <e> <s> he addresses the question of a remit to the tribunal <e> <s> though it is clearly for the convenience of your lordships to consider these amendments together a number of different issues arise <e> <s> i should like to examine those dealing with clause separately from that concerned with reporting the possible commission of a new interception offence <e>", "<cs> i believe i have not done your lordships as well as i would wish in answering this point <e> <s> the noble lord has been very generous to me on other occasions and agreed to take back what i have said to read it so may i have the same privilege in reverse and have the chance to take back this amendment carefully to study what he said <e> <s> of course i would have to do so without commitment <e>", "<cs> faced with that formidable combination so cleverly brought together by the noble lord lord mishcon i think that what i shall seek to do is to explain the position as the government understand it at the moment <e> <s> i have to say that we were anxious to discover exactly the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> so i should just like to set out why i think that it is difficult for us but at the same time why i realise that the matter has to be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> we looked at one aspect of the tribunal a moment ago on the noble lords other three amendments <e> <s> perhaps i should say in answer to him when he kindly withdrew the amendment that i think i would have replied to him that now at least we all start from understanding what we are all driving at <e> <s> i am not sure that we did do that when we started <e> <s> thus on the previous amendment i think we have made considerable progress in knowing exactly where we were seeking to go <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was of course addressing myself i think properly to the amendment which involves actually putting something on the face of the bill <e> <s> i come back to the remark made by the noble and learned lord lord denning that sometimes guidelines are better than putting something on the face of the bill <e> <s> in responding to the noble lord lord mishcon on that earlier amendment i promised to seek to put it on the face of the bill at that moment against the advice of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> now the noble lord lord mishcon and myself are i believe coming together in seeking to see whether it would be possible to put guidelines to the tribunal rather than on the face of the bill <e> <s> i cannot commit myself <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i do not know the position <e> <s> i would have to consult with my colleagues and of course that i shall certainly do <e>", "<cs> once again the noble lord lord mishcon has moved his amendment very succinctly <e> <s> nevertheless it is important as we come to the various important roles of the tribunal that i refer to some of the points surrounding the amendment at somewhat greater length <e> <s> i think in the circumstances that it is inevitable that i should do so <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord donaldson has said the amendment before your lordships committee is in identical terms to that proposed by my honourable friend the member for fylde in another place <e> <s> the issue is whether the present arrangements for the management of the security services and in particular for the expression of concern by its members are adequate <e> <s> associated with it are questions of the role of ministers as those ultimately responsible for the accountability of the service <e>", "<cs> in presenting this amendment to your lordships the noble lord lord mishcon has raised a number of specific points with which i shall deal in a moment <e> <s> he has also raised general questions about clause as a whole and it may be helpful to your lordships if i comment on them first <e>", "<cs> i have not finished <e> <s> i think i should say to the noble lord that that was on the specific point of the industrial tribunal about which he made a very specific and important point <e> <s> if despite what i have said the prosecution in a criminal case has in its possession as a result of interception material which might clear the defendant but which cannot be put in evidence because of clause and which incidentally because of long-standing practice would not now be put in evidence either and if that evidence is capable of raising a reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors as to the guilt of the accused the prosecution will be dropped <e> <s> i understand from my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general that this is the practice of the director of prosecutions where similar problems arise today and any case where this problem does arise will come to the directors attention <e> <s> this will of course be more clearly certain when the crown prosecution service comes into operation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for giving the committee an opportunity to consider the definition of serious crime which as he said was introduced into the bill in response to concerns whose force the government accepted expressed in another place <e> <s> for reasons which i shall set out in a moment though i am bound to resist the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord <e> <s> i am nevertheless sure that it is important that your lordships should have the opportunity to examine one of the provisions which is as the noble and learned lord lord denning said so fundamental to the exercise of the secretary of states discretion <e>", "<cs> i think this is one of the most upside down discussions that has ever occurred that the noble lord lord mishcon should be arguing for cutting down the number of lawyers and that i of all people should be standing resolutely to their defence in a manner which would make the lord chancellor proud indeed i am sure <e> <s> but that is to some extent the position <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has advanced a cogent case for the inclusion of such a provision in relation to a quorum in the provisions governing the tribunal <e> <s> i believe that the government and the noble lord are of one mind on virtually everything that has been said on this subject today <e> <s> first and foremost we are agreed and i think the noble and learned lord lord denning has agreed very strongly too on the importance of the tribunal <e> <s> it lies at the very heart of the bill and provides a very real remedy for those against whom warrants have been wrongly directed <e> <s> the noble lord is accordingly quite right to emphasise that the tribunals decisions must be properly taken <e> <s> they may directly affect an individual in a very personal and significant way and may directly bear on his rights <e> <s> of that there can be no doubt <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon in moving this amendment and speaking to those associated with it has i believe done your lordships house a service by drawing attention to the very important provisions of schedule which i think it is fair to say did not receive as much attention in another place as perhaps they deserved <e> <s> in relation to the disclosure of so-called metering information that is records of the numbers dialled and the length and duration of calls made from a particular telephone the provisions of schedule provide a clear legal framework modelled on that found in the data protection act to control such disclosures and make any disclosure outside that framework a criminal offence <e> <s> this is another significant advance which this bill brings for the safeguarding of the individuals privacy against undue intrusion and it takes full account both of the views expressed in your lordships house when this matter was raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington during our debates on the telecommunications bill last year and of the relevant findings of the european court in the malone case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house was wishing to hear from the noble lord exactly why <e> <s> i was giving that opportunity but i must say to the noble lord and to the house reproved as i have been that we ought to resume an orderly procedure <e> <s> the amendment either should or should not be moved but i was being fair to the noble lord and giving him the opportunity to explain <e> <s> if there were to be any further discussion it must be right that either the noble lord himself or as i understand is possible another noble lord should move the amendment <e> <s> if a noble lord decided to do so he might perhaps take this opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously do not wish in any way to be unfair to the noble lord <e> <s> my understanding was that he had wished to move his amendment today <e> <s> if i have done him an injustice in <e>", "<cs> my lords having said plainly that we must come to order i must tell my noble friend that to order we must come <e> <s> therefore the only way that i can understand our coming to order i hope i am not unduly stupid in this matter and i do not think so is that if it is the wish of the house or the wish of any one member that the amendment should be moved that noble lord can move the amendment <e> <s> that course is open to any noble lord who decides to do so <e> <s> if a noble lord wishes to take that course i must ask that that noble lord should take that action now <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask my noble friend to address the amendment <e> <s> i hope in a difficult situation to guide the house as its leader <e> <s> quite apart from any other considerations i said that i thought the noble lord lord rochester should have the right to explain his position <e> <s> i made it clear that someone else could move the amendment <e> <s> i understand that i was correct in saying that <e> <s> but i must in the interests of the whole house and i sense that i am speaking for the whole house in this matter ask my noble friend to address himself to the particular amendment to hand <e>", "<cs> my lords this question is going on at some length <e> <s> three noble lords have risen to speak <e> <s> of course i will allow those three to speak certainly the noble lord lord bruce of donington my noble friend lord inglewood and the noble lord lord tordoff but i think that after that we shall probably have had enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i must bow to the noble lord the opposition chief whip if he wishes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course bear everything in mind it is my duty to do so <e> <s> but the noises that i heard coming from around the house and not all from one side led me to the conclusion that on the whole the house would wish to pass to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords this year in response to representations we have instituted a two-day defence debate <e> <s> as leader of your lordships house i will be only too ready after the debate next week to consider through the usual channels future arrangements based on our experience of this year <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why i thought it right to wind up what was to be this broad debate today <e> <s> i wanted through personal participation in the debate to gain experience myself on the best way for this house to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord boston lord kennet and lord cledwyn all referred to the question of the merchant fleet <e> <s> like all noble lords who have spoken on this matter the government are most concerned about the position of our merchant fleet <e> <s> the result of that concern is a study which has just been received by the department of transport and will be most carefully considered by both departments <e>", "<cs> the evidence seemed to come my lords from the noble lords noble friend lord mayhew who was quite clear that this was taking place <e> <s> in view of the exchanges that have continued among various noble lords about different aspects of defence policy i was hoping that possibly both noble lords might get together <e> <s> i heard the noble lord <e> <s> lord mayhew declaring quite plainly that he believed that that was certainly happening and so i was delighted to quote him in aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that in certain ways reinforces what i said <e> <s> it is understood that the russians have started <e> <s> they have the worlds only deployed ballistic missile defence system around moscow and they have an extensive and long <e>", "<cs> it is too much for me my lords <e> <s> i was asked a question i gave the answer that i was given <e> <s> i hope that i have fulfilled my position <e> <s> to go further would get me into water in which i do not think i am capable of swimming <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i have to reciprocate do i not <e> <s> we shall be able to remain in that position for years to come let us hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that at the committee stage we had an important debate on an important part of the bill <e> <s> i hoped that at that stage i was able at least to put the problem clearly where it belongs in an international context <e> <s> in withdrawing his amendment in committee on the economic criterion the noble lord said that he would study very carefully what had been said <e> <s> i hope however despite some of the powerful support which i have had and which i shall come to he will allow me to cover some of the ground i covered on that occasion because i believe that it is material to the points that he has raised today <e> <s> also because of the possibility of misunderstanding about this phrase it is right that i should set the matter out once again very clearly <e> <s> the noble lord has explained his purpose very properly of seeking to introduce more precision into this part of the bill <e> <s> i am bound to tell him however that although i fully understand his reasons for wishing to do so for some of the reasons which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and the noble and learned lord lord denning gave this is not a change which the government feel that they can accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i owe the noble lord lord mishcon a short answer <e> <s> of course i accept that if he decides that he wishes to take the view of the house that is perhaps the only way that we can proceed <e> <s> but before he does so i would like to put two points to him <e> <s> the noble lord mentions that he would not wish us slavishly to follow the european convention <e> <s> i would prefer to point out to him that we have not done that <e> <s> our provision is in any case a great deal narrower than the european convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very tentative in view of my extreme newness in your lordships house to interpret various rules <e> <s> i understand that ministers are allowed to make second speeches of brief duration <e> <s> if i have offended by making a somewhat long speech in the first instance i did so in the hope although it does not seem to have been altogether successful of persuading the noble lord lord mishcon of the strength of my case <e> <s> if i made a short intervention afterwards it was to add to what i had said previously <e> <s> if either the noble lord lord mishcon or myself in making a second speech have transgressed the rules we are wrong <e> <s> i apologise but i should like to say to the noble lord that we were discussing a matter that is very important <e> <s> it was right that we should have discussed it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have the answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> if it is not correct i shall certainly write to him later <e> <s> i understand that it would be for the person dealing with the material to make that decision but of course he will be subject to the commissioners overall scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon when he moved this amendment in committee i said that i feared that i had failed completely to catch the point that he was putting to me <e> <s> i undertook to give very careful consideration to what he had said <e> <s> having read what i said i think that i understated that position <e> <s> i had clearly not taken on board the point which the noble lord was making and i am very grateful to him for coming forward again <e> <s> i hope that this time at least i shall be able to answer fully the point that he made <e> <s> whether or not i shall satisfy him by doing so remains to be seen but at least i think i can give him a very clear argument on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall first seek to reply briefly to the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> i shall also undertake to consider further the points that he has made <e> <s> in considering the adequacy of the arrangements the commissioner is bound to judge how they are given effect to <e> <s> indeed he has at the same time through clause to deal with their general work and with their implementation and as i am advised it is all in clause <e> <s> but in view of the very important point made by the noble lord i shall of course check this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say this <e> <s> obviously i have not persuaded him that in general terms it would he wrong to extend the jurisdiction of the tribunal beyond the area of clauses to which deal with warrants involving the secretary of state <e> <s> that i believe is fundamental to the bill <e> <s> the safeguards we believe are better and could be dealt with only by the commissioner <e> <s> that is the difference between us <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can say on this occasion that the noble lord lord mishcon the government and i were all on the same side and that it is purely a matter of drafting <e> <s> i was going to give some of the reasons for preferring amendment no <e> <s> to amendment no <e> <s> which the noble and learned lord lord denning has given <e> <s> it will be quite unnecessary for me to repeat those reasons but they were the reasons we felt that amendment no <e> <s> was the better of the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is not doing that but as he has sat down i shall seek to answer the noble lord lord mishcon and leave aside the other important point which my noble friend was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept at once that this clause moved by the noble lord lord harris is important and has considerable support in different parts of and different parties in another place <e> <s> i also accept that i have put forward some answers on the previous occasion and i think i can go some way further on this occasion than i was able to do on the last one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said it may be for the convenience of your lordships as we are dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and if i also refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and which i shall move <e> <s> i believe that that is what the noble lord lord mishcon was suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord denning has stated far more clearly than i could what i intend to say in answer to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we have discussed the purpose of clause the tribunals position and all the time the question of secrecy which is so vitally important under the whole of this bill and which concerns the purpose of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it is clear to me that a layman however well briefed comes to the moment when dealing with three of the most eminent legal brains of different capacities in this country he must say let me see <e> <s> that is what i say to the noble lord <e> <s> i must do so without any commitment <e> <s> the noble lord has been very gracious <e> <s> he has offered the same position back <e> <s> i shall consult those most closely concerned and will return to the noble lord and other noble lords and seek before third reading to put the matter beyond any doubt if i can <e> <s> that would seem to be the proper course <e> <s> the noble lord has given me that opportunity and i am extremely grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to the noble baroness lady seear for their comments on the statement <e> <s> first in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn i think it is clear that it was from the british point of view a disappointing conference <e> <s> he suggested that none of our proposals had been taken up <e> <s> however some of the proposals which the french and the germans have put forward are in fact based very closely on some of the proposals that we in britain put forward <e> <s> i think it is important to say that <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is neither a setback nor a defeat <e> <s> certainly it is not the end of the road of constructive proposals and i am grateful to him for saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> that was the first note which i wrote down and i failed to answer it <e> <s> it is one of the factors which i can answer on my own account and not on behalf of my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> on my own account i can say that most certainly we shall be prepared to look at that through the usual channels <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said it is a particularly difficult time of the year but if we can fit it in we shall certainly consider that and we shall certainly agree to discussion through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i gladly pay tribute to the work of your lordships european committees which have in fact achieved a very considerable amount and are greatly valued both throughout parliament and indeed elsewhere <e> <s> if such a report could be published and that again could be considered through the usual channels in time for a debate that might be a very satisfactory development <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boothby who very properly reminds us of his considerable contribution to european affairs in the past <e> <s> certainly what i have said about political will is abundantly true <e> <s> i have no doubt that my right honourable friend the prime minister will repeat that over and over again <e> <s> that will be far more important than anything i might ever say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will generally agree with what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has said <e> <s> i would not wish to comment any further <e> <s> if i did it might appear to be a criticism of other countries and of their attitude at this conference <e> <s> i do not think that would be in any way helpful <e> <s> i think it is far more important to seek to proceed to the next conference now and to make the most constructive contribution we can to it <e> <s> perhaps the best hope is that if other countries were not ready to consider some of the proposals we put forward on this occasion there will certainly not be that excuse next time <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i do not think the government treat the whole result of this conference in any way tragically my right honourable friend the prime minister was i think justifiably disappointed particularly in view of the proposals that the british government had put forward and she hoped would be discussed on that occasion <e> <s> but it is certainly not a tragic situation <e> <s> and of course my right honourable friend will go to the next conference with the proposals and will be prepared to discuss them <e> <s> i think her feeling was one of disappointment that some decisions which could have been taken at milan were postponed and that it would have been better if they had not been postponed <e> <s> but beyond that certainly it is not tragic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that though i have heard that said i cannot at this moment confirm it <e> <s> perhaps it is as well because the noble lord seeks to lead me on to make comments on that particular action <e> <s> i am singularly ill-equipped to do so <e> <s> i shall therefore find out what is the correct position as far as the commission and the cereal prices are concerned and i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that my right honourable friend the prime minister made was indeed that many of the proposals that the united kingdom had put forward depended for their implementation and for progress to be made on them on political will rather than amendment of the treaty <e> <s> that is where we come back to the need for the political will <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that certainly the united kingdom government would wish to press forward with proposals on the internal market on the lines mentioned by the noble lord lord cockfield and no doubt will do so at the next conference <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said about the conference <e> <s> naturally my right honourable friend the prime minister will be determined to go there and press forward with the proposals one of which the noble lord mentioned at that time <e> <s> my right honourable friends only disappointment is that more progress could have been made now and did not have to wait for another conference but she now knows that it will have to be done at another conference and therefore she will seek to get the proposals through at that next conference <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as far as i am aware <e> <s> i am always careful of all these blanket assurances because there may be some part of the proposals put forward by the noble lord lord cockfield with which unbeknown to me the government do not agree <e> <s> if that is the case i shall let the noble lord know but basically i believe the answer to be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be for me to tell the house how to express its views the house is very well able to do so and does so on many occasions <e> <s> i have to point out that naturally i would consider this suggestion and put it to the usual channels <e> <s> if noble lords so wish it i shall soon know <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> i have been asked about setting up a select committee but naturally a debate comes within the terms of the same question <e> <s> in view of the pressure of other business there is now very little time left for debates before the house adjourns for the summer recess <e> <s> i was asked yesterday whether it would be possible to have a debate on for example the problems of europe following the milan conference <e> <s> there are competitors for the time of the house but no doubt they will all be very carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to continue straying far from the original question but it is important that i should reply to the noble lord the leader of the opposition on this point <e> <s> it is in fact a study which is being made for my right honourable friend the minister of transport <e> <s> i cannot say exactly when it will be completed <e> <s> when it has been completed it will of course be considered by both the ministry of transport and the ministry of defence <e> <s> i cannot at this stage answer questions as to its publication <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be very bad if when answering questions i did not set a good example by keeping to the rules or rather the recommendations of the procedure committee <e> <s> if i were to stray down the road along which i am tempted by the noble lord i should not be doing so and i am sure he will understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see from the tone of the questions that there will probably be a desire in the house that i should discuss this matter through the usual channels to see what can be done <e> <s> in those circumstances it would not be right for me to stray further into the merits of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the study has been set up and is being considered in the first instance by the department of transport and the ministry of defence but naturally in a matter of this importance there will be input and discussion throughout the whole government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i was not aware of any of the matters he put to me and that makes his question all the more important <e> <s> we shall of course consider what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord that i am quite clear now the more so from what he has said that i should discuss this whole matter through the usual channels and i shall do so <e> <s> we shall eventually report our position to the house <e> <s> in doing so we shall naturally at the same time take into account the important point made by my noble friend lord rochdale <e> <s> we can then consider what is the best way for this house to proceed in dealing with this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i again note that the house as a whole wishes this matter to be considered by the usual channels <e> <s> much as i am tempted as so often i am by my noble friend to continue and perhaps to agree with what he said i have already said that i shall not comment on the merits of the case and so i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords these are matters which will certainly be considered when we come to decide whether or not a select committee should be set up <e> <s> however if the house decides to set up a select committee and decides to use resources to that end the select committee is bound to take a longer-term view as indeed our select committees always have and as i believe this house expects them to do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to interpret the views of the house when they are applied to oneself <e> <s> i am doing my best and perhaps i am right in thinking that the house has heard enough of me on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house feels that we have had some time on this question <e> <s> so far as the courtesy of the house is concerned i hope that the noble lord will remember that he had this question down on a previous occasion i think it was last week and he did not appear to ask it <e> <s> i understand that perfectly well <e> <s> many of us have reasons for not appearing to ask questions from time to time but there was no apology from the noble lord so i think that we should just forget all about courtesies <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will remember that he should have apologised <e> <s> i think that the courtesies have been upheld <e> <s> i do not think the house would wish to go further into the matter on this occasion <e> <s> i rather hope that this will be the end of the matter so far as the noble lord is concerned <e>", "<cs> if i have been in any way in error my lords as the house knows i am always the first to apologise <e> <s> i did not hear of that apology by the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i should have and perhaps there was some mistake <e> <s> if there was it is my fault <e> <s> that is all the more reason why i think that the house will probably want to move on to other business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that whatever happens at this stage the noble lord lord airedale has the absolute right to move his particular amendment thereafter <e> <s> the noble lord the chairman of committees suggested that there might be a debate in the autumn if these matters are referred back to the procedure committee <e> <s> while i am on my feet perhaps i may say on behalf of the government that i shall undertake to seek to provide time for such a debate in the autumn if that is the wish of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from myself nobody else is rising to speak so the noble and learned lord on the woolsack will be able to put the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there could certainly be an interim report from the select committee <e> <s> i understand that the select committee is meeting this afternoon and its members will therefore have heard the views now being expressed in your lordships house <e> <s> if an interim report was published it would indeed be possible for your lordships to debate it and to reach a decision if that was the wish of the house on a temporary continuation of the present arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that would be the purpose of an interim report if that is what the select committee decided to produce so that the evidence of that report could be debated <e> <s> alternatively of course the select committee will produce a full report by the christmas recess and there will always be an opportunity to debate that <e> <s> the purpose of an interim report would simply be if the house wished to come to a temporary decision earlier than by the christmas recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will be for the select commitee to report to us on what would be the technical possibilities if we were to go on in the future <e> <s> i do not think that it would be for me this afternoon to comment on them <e> <s> i have to say to my noble friend that i personally do not find the lights difficult <e> <s> in fact with the lights on i can actually read my notes without my glasses <e> <s> i cannot do that when the lights are not on <e>", "<cs> my lords first in answer to the noble lords last point the experiment was for approximately six months and the experiment does end unless renewed by the wish of this house at the end of this period before the summer recess <e> <s> on that there is no doubt <e> <s> whether or not there is an interim report is a matter for the select committee to decide <e> <s> they will hear the views expressed this afternoon <e> <s> they will have heard the noble lords view <e> <s> it is not for me to decide what particular view they will come to when they have heard this exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the select committee will note what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the house that from time to time i have some scepticism about public opinion surveys <e> <s> however if there has been such a public opinion survey as the noble lord suggests no doubt that will be a matter which the select committee will look into <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for their various responses to the proposal that i made <e> <s> i am also grateful to the house for thinking that it was right for me to change my mind and that of the government regarding this proposal after i had heard the representations last week <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon speaking from the opposition front bench supported by the noble lord lord dean of beswick who both felt that while the bill was a very urgent one it was nevertheless right to take this course <e> <s> it is perfectly fair to say that <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank noble lords who have spoken for their kind remarks <e> <s> but in the main i should like to reply to the very reasoned way in which the noble lord lord foot has put forward what is a very important question <e> <s> when i first heard his speech and those who advise me will know this i went away and said i think that lord foot is right <e> <s> it seems to me that the point he makes is a very sound one <e> <s> i asked for his point to be studied properly and i wrote back to the noble lord explaining what i had been informed and advised <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord does not feel wholly satisfied but i agree with him that it would be helpful if i were to repeat what i said in my letter to him in this particular debate so that reference could be made to it in the future <e> <s> that i gladly do <e>", "<cs> do not let us spoil this sudden friendship <e> <s> i did not quite understand the noble lord to have said just exactly that <e> <s> however perhaps that was my lack of recognition of his arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be for me to comment off the cuff on a matter like that <e> <s> i certainly note that it is not desirable to use the order paper when a great deal of correspondence has proceeded beforehand <e> <s> i quite appreciate why the noble lord lord kennet did it <e> <s> i hope that i have given him an answer which in all the circumstances is a fair one <e>", "<cs> my lords i sense that the house probably feels that there has been sufficient discussion of this matter and that it has been fully ventilated in all the circumstances <e> <s> i hope that we can now move on <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not perhaps fully appreciate that <e> <s> i did feel that i was giving vent to the feelings of the house in saying that this question has been fully discussed <e> <s> i hope that in those circumstances and despite his involvement in it the noble lord will feel that honour has been satisfied on all sides by the exchanges that have taken place <e> <s> i hope that he will take that view <e> <s> i can only interpret the wishes of the house that is my task but i do feel that this is what the house as a whole feels <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to accept it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have done my best to get the feelings of the house and of all those concerned <e> <s> if i have made a mistake i can only apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i did feel however that i was doing my duty to the house <e> <s> we have had some minutes on question time <e>", "<cs> and much of that time has been spent by noble lords asking questions about which they feel equally as strongly as noble lords feel about this one <e> <s> that must be appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i looked very carefully at the noble lords request <e> <s> i read the article very carefully and i did not conclude that it was a matter of such urgency as would permit me in the name of the house to decide that a private notice question should be allowed <e> <s> that was my decision <e> <s> i understand the noble lords anxieties <e> <s> he is right but i have to say that in doing my duty to this house i concluded that it was not a question which should be a private notice question <e> <s> that is the duty placed upon me by the house <e> <s> i took that decision and i have to tell the noble lord that i feel i must stand by it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise to the house on behalf of my noble friend lord young <e> <s> he had an engagement which he believed he could not cancel <e> <s> i myself take full responsibility for having said that on this occasion my noble friend should fulfil another engagement because having judged the merits of the case i believed that to be the right action <e> <s> his absence is totally my responsibility <e> <s> i will see to it that my noble friend is here in future <e> <s> on this occasion having been consulted i thought that i had taken the right decision <e> <s> my noble friend is himself anxious to be in the house when such matters are being debated <e> <s> obviously i must take responsibility for his absence in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition lord cledwyn for his remarks in what i accept is for this house a very difficult situation <e> <s> i do not deny that for one moment <e> <s> the noble lord asked me if i will give assurances about a precedent for the future <e> <s> probably the right thing to say on these occasions is that one never knows what will happen in life owing to human frailty but i will do my best given the opportunity to do so <e> <s> that i shall certainly do and i can give that undertaking but that is a very human undertaking and it is subject to all the relevant factors of human frailty in this life <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that exactly the same procedure was followed on this occasion as in the past <e> <s> if your lordships wish to change the procedure that is a matter for consideration but as long as it remains it is fair to follow it <e> <s> comments are made on all such documents from time to time sometimes quickly and sometimes a little later <e> <s> the house will have a chance to debate the report early in the next session and i hope that it is agreed that that is the best way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord i think implied this bill has been certified by mr speaker in another place as a money bill and it is quite usual to take all stages of such bills on one day <e> <s> this arrangement has been agreed through the usual channels <e> <s> i do not think that any controversy is basically expected although there may be arguments naturally durings its consideration <e> <s> but it is i believe a reasonable procedure that has been followed frequently in the past <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to the noble lord lord diamond for their response to the statement <e> <s> i am also grateful for their support for the expressions of abhorrence of apartheid and for many of the other measures taken which are mentioned in the statement <e> <s> i therefore do not think i need to waste the time of the house on commenting on measures where there was clear support for what is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there will be many people in this country and perhaps throughout the world who will listen to the wise words of my noble friend lord home of the hirsel who has unrivalled experience of these matters <e> <s> i must say that i wholly agree with what he has said <e> <s> her majestys government wholly agree with the position that he has set out <e> <s> i hope that many of the people who advocate stronger measures will think very carefully on the words which my noble friend has just spoken to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to be drawn by the noble lord in further comments about other people <e> <s> suffice it to say that as my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary has made clear the british government believe in the circumstances that very serious consideration should be given to the release of mr mandela as a means of helping to remove the tension at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has produced a number of trick questions for me <e> <s> i think i shall answer them fairly briefly and in a straight manner <e> <s> first the government have said that they will not see the head of the anc until he has renounced violence in accordance with the position we have made clear in other cases <e> <s> i think it has to be said that these are people who are not prepared to renounce violence directed against the overthrow of the state in south africa <e> <s> that i would have thought puts them in an entirely different position from the president of that state <e> <s> they are seeking by violence to upset the state and we have agreed that we will not see those who have engaged in violence <e> <s> that remains our position <e> <s> indeed i do not think the various comparisons with other cases are appropriate in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i will enter into a discussion with my noble friend about the various historical matters which i think go slightly wider than the statement that i have just made <e> <s> i note and i agree profoundly with what he has said about the need for peaceful change <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add anything to the statements that have been made by my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary on all these subjects over a period of time <e> <s> i think that the positions of the british government are very well known <e> <s> these were discussed <e> <s> the position of president reagan is very well known and as a result the nations together expressed their support and confidence in president reagans approach <e> <s> i think the basic proposals behind the approach are really very well known from many statements that have been made previously <e>", "<cs> my lords mindful as i always am of seeking to further the recommendations of the procedure committee of this house as my position as leader should certainly imply i think that i have to say that that supplementary question goes far beyond the statement which i have just made to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a mistake for me to go further than the statements which have been made in the commonwealth accord and the agreement among the ec members <e> <s> if there is any way in which i can help the noble lord lord diamond or the noble lord after discussing this with my colleagues i shall be very pleased to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees of this house for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord shakes his head but that is what i believe and i am entitled to believe it and what is more an awful lot of other people believe it too <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord blease asked about the discussions with the government of southern ireland <e> <s> i can say nothing further about that today nor do i think he would expect me to do so <e> <s> i can assure him that if there is an initiative it will of course be under the control of parliament and this house would have an early opportunity to debate anything which might come forward on that front <e> <s> i give him that complete assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should add also no less a tribute to the judiciary who have maintained the highest standards of impartiality and integrity of which we are proud <e> <s> but we must never relax our efforts to secure the support of all sections of the community including the minority for the security forces and for the judicial system in northern ireland <e> <s> relations between the security forces and the minority cross-border security co-operation and public confidence in the administration of justice are issues which will be for the intergovernmental conference to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been extremely generous to me in some of the things he has said far too generous to me <e> <s> i could be very generous to him by mentioning many of the things which he did for me in the past <e> <s> i feel as frustrated as he does about some of the things which happened in the past <e> <s> i put it all behind me <e> <s> i think we have to <e> <s> all that i am really asking the noble lord now because he has made a very considerable speech of great importance is that as he was able to co-operate with me once before in what was an effort for the future while we may have had our doubts i hope that he will be able to say at the end of his speech that he will co-operate once again with the british government and with many people and with those of us the noble lord lord cledwyn the noble lord lord donaldson and others who have already spoken in seeking to give this particular agreement the fairest wind that he can <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the question put by the noble lord the leader of the opposition is for me to answer <e> <s> i believe that i gave a perfectly fair answer to the noble earl who asked the question in the first instance <e> <s> of course i did not know that there was anything of the imputation which the noble lord has suggested nor do i seek to make one myself <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord says but equally if a noble lord asks me to look into a question then it must be for me as leader of the house so to do <e>", "<cs> oh no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a question about me <e> <s> i think it is perfectly clear from the account that my noble friend lord molson gave of my correspondence with him that i acted in totally good faith to this house and indeed to everyone else throughout <e> <s> when the noble lord lord molson approached me in the first instance i went to my colleagues and as he rightly said the motion was taken off the order paper <e> <s> shortly afterwards the joint select committee was set up <e> <s> i do not think anybody would accuse me of taking all the trouble to get noble lords of this house to set on a joint committee if i thought it was going to be overruled if it came to a particular decision one way or the other <e> <s> of course not <e> <s> at the end of the time i think i am right in saying that the joint select committee reported on rd april <e> <s> the first time i knew there was any question of a bill of this kind being produced was at the beginning of june <e> <s> i knew it then but i should point out that that was two months after the select committee had reported <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that if my right honourable friend in another place had made that decision and if he had not told me and i had subsequently discovered i should have been extremely angry <e> <s> i have not subsequently so discovered <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the chief whip that i am now taking part in a disorderly procedure <e> <s> this is clearly not something that i ought to do <e> <s> however in view of the good point made by the noble lord may i say simply that i will look into this question with the appropriate authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord diamond for their very important comments on what i accept is a very important statement <e> <s> i will do my very best to answer a great many of the questions all the questions that i can and there have been quite properly a very large number of them <e> <s> first of all i will seek to answer the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> he suggested that the statement is surrounded by a good deal of verbiage <e> <s> i must say to your lordships that since i learned of this matter i have had one overriding consideration in my mind <e> <s> perhaps it is reasonable for me to say it because i have actually been a cabinet minister of this country for out of the last years so i have some experience of cabinet government <e> <s> i think that i am entitled to say that to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that he was not so aware <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord for not having answered that question previously <e> <s> however i have done my best to answer many questions about what i accept to be an unhappy story <e> <s> i have given my personal version which i think your lordships would expect of some of the events from my personal experience which as a member of that particular cabinet i think it is only fair to do <e> <s> i still believe that if one member of a cabinet decides to conduct a campaign such as the then secretary of state for defence decided to conduct against the policy of the rest of the cabinet it is extremely difficult for good cabinet government for confidentiality and for joint cabinet responsibility to be preserved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think without excusing the fact as my right honourable friend the prime minister herself also said the answer first of all is that those concerned believed it was very urgent indeed in the interests of the company that if there were material inaccuracies in that letter it should reach the company in time for the meeting at pm <e> <s> they believed that was very urgent indeed <e> <s> secondly i think it is fair to point out that here lies the problem of the way the whole campaign was being conducted by the then secretary of state for defence and the whole difficulty for cabinet government that is if a statement had been made it would have to have been a statement by one department flatly contradicting a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord marsh because i am going to start my answer to him by making a statement which could not be contradicted if i may say so by the members of any party who have ever been in government even those who may have been a very long time away from government <e> <s> of course he is right when he says there have been leaks and squabbles in all governments <e> <s> there is no one in this house who could pretend otherwise at all in any way <e> <s> there always have been and i suppose frequently there will

right when he says that this issue is occupying far too much time <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all it comes very surprisingly from the mouth of the noble lord lord hatch that there should not be an inquiry <e> <s> no one has spent more of his time during waking hours considering inquiries of one sort or another over a long period of time than the noble lord <e> <s> i should have thought that had there not been an inquiry the noble lord would have been to his feet determined not to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords first question was when was the solicitor-general told that his letter had been leaked <e> <s> i imagine though i cannot give the exact time that clearly he knew it when he saw it on the tape at about that afternoon <e> <s> but i do not imagine that he can have known it much before that since his letter was only written and received in the government departments at <e> <s> it must have been sometime in that period <e> <s> in answer to the question as to why an inquiry my right honourable friend the prime minister believed that as much as possible of the facts of what had gone on should come out into the open <e> <s> as she made very clear herself she did not know what had been done at that time <e> <s> therefore she believed it was right to have a leak inquiry and that is why she had it <e> <s> i believe that there would have been enormous criticism if there had not been the inquiry and there would have been many calls for one <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend lord maude i have no doubt it is as one might say in this field in the public knowledge that the name of the civil servant was given in another place by a member who certainly it is also in the public knowledge is a member of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly she was not told that because it was not true <e> <s> they did not give authority <e> <s> they had no power to give such authority <e> <s> the statement made perfectly clear that my right honourable

some of the points made by the noble lord <e> <s> i accept them <e> <s> i am as keen a supporter of the anglo-irish agreement as anyone <e> <s> i am so because i have experience of some of the problems involved <e> <s> i agree that it is important to get the truth across <e> <s> that is one of the most difficult things to be done in this particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be very dangerous for me to speculate on these matters particularly since i realise that i would be offending against one of my own rules that is i would be answering a question very wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the government are very much in the hands of both this house and another place <e> <s> i think it is important that that should be the case <e> <s> i should like to see progress with the anglo-irish agreement very much indeed but we must consider how both houses of parliament in this country could help towards that <e> <s> i believe that we must consider that very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords again i would be straying a little but this is an important matter so i will offend against my rules just for a moment to say that press statements issued by the british and irish governments describing the proceedings of the intergovernmental conference have been placed in the library of the house and in the printed paper office following each of the meetings which have so far taken place <e> <s> we intend that that should be the normal practice <e> <s> if we can do more to help this house and to get more information i hope that noble lords will tell me as i am anxious to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords surprisingly enough i have article in front of me and it says here <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first instance the moment that the noble lord said that mr bristow had exonerated the prime minister he even more effectively made my point that within the present honours system no such offer could conceivably have been made <e> <s> secondly it is not for me to either confirm or deny the noble lords propositions about mr bristow since i must say and i do not say this in any <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be proper for

refrain from any particular comment on this issue <e>", "<cs> i think i am right my lords to confine myself to saying that i really do not know mr bristows position because more and more assertions

occasions <e> <s> but even if i were to say yes i think that would be absolutely splendid i would not actually be making an offer nor would i be making a recommendation because in every regard the checks and balances in our <e>", "<cs> my lords in fairness to myself because if you are not fair to yourself nobody else is ever likely to be i do not think that at any time i have made any statement which was in any way derogatory to mr bristow <e> <s> i have indeed been most careful not to do so <e> <s> secondly i cannot see that there is any purpose in having an inquiry <e> <s> i described what happened as tittle-tattle and i would simply say that if the sort of occasion in which many of your lordships must have taken part from time to time had taken place then the sort of gossip which might continue on these matters does qualify later on in the light of day as tittle-tattle and i think i am entitled to described it as such <e>", "<cs> i can only note my noble friends suggestion my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> four <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble viscount lord hanworth for introducing this subject for the way in which he introduced it and perhaps more than anything else for giving me some idea of what he was going to say beforehand <e> <s> for that i was extremely grateful <e> <s> i had to decide how i could best help your lordships house in replying to this debate <e> <s> it seemed to me that there were various options open to me <e> <s> the first was to take some of the subjects which the noble viscount had said that he wished to raise to hawk them all round whitehall and get very carefully prepared answers from many different departments on the different subjects concerned and to come to your lordships house with a very carefully prepared brief which may or may not have represented my own personal views but which were very safe as far as my colleagues in government were concerned <e> <s> i rejected that view <e>", "<cs> my lords memories of history tend to be selective but of course i accept entirely what the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby says <e> <s> my memory was that the then prime minister now the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx actually dismissed the official opposition <e> <s> i have to tell him that my noble friend lord carrington did not dismiss me <e> <s> he simply said that i should have been continuing to co-operate and had failed despite everything else <e> <s> but my point is still the same and i should like to put this to the noble viscount why were those great parliamentarians mr <e> <s> foot and mr powell so much against this proposal <e> <s> for a very simple reason <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords i represented it while i was secretary of state for northern ireland for two years and secretary of state at the home office for four years <e> <s> i do not think one could have two jobs which demanded more time away from a constituency than those two did or two jobs that gave you more sudden preoccupations so that you had to cancel going to your constituency at the last minute <e> <s> yet throughout all that time i felt it was right to do the job and i made certain not least because i know that in the political world the difference between you are so busy now that you really mustnt come and the devil never turns up he is too grand now is a very narrow one indeed and one must take great care to keep on the right side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that the commissioner of the metropolitan police has expressed reservations and is worried about fulfilling his duties under the sessional order <e> <s> i understand that there have been discussions that this house and another place have considered the matter and that some reservations have been expressed to the glc about the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord says <e> <s> i understand that the bus lanes in millbank have been introduced by experimental orders for a period of months <e> <s> there is no procedure for objections to such experimental orders <e> <s> during the period of the experiment objections may be made to the orders being made permanent <e> <s> of course when the glc finishes on st april this is a matter that will properly come to be considered by the westminster city council <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend having been a minister of transport has had considerable responsibility in all these matters <e> <s> the fact is that this order has been introduced experimentally <e> <s> objections can be made if it is seen not to work <e> <s> i understand that it was supposed to come into effect on th february but the covers on the signs have not yet been removed so it has not come into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly after st april this will be a matter for the westminster city council to consider and it is properly its duty so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the points made over the years by the noble lord have seemed eminently reasonable to me too <e> <s> i should have thought that this was one <e> <s> it is a pity maybe that neither of us has any responsibility in the matter of deciding upon experimental traffic arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this responsibility falls to that council on st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that for a long time i thought that the lights at hyde park corner which i frequently come round were crazy <e> <s> i was always informed by some people that they were a very good idea <e> <s> i am now bound to say that it does not take me any longer to get round than it did before <e> <s> but it took a good deal of time before <e> <s> it may be a good arrangement <e> <s> i simply do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords that would of course be a matter for the commissioner of the metropolitan police <e> <s> he has two duties if the bus lanes come into effect <e> <s> first he has to maintain the law <e> <s> secondly in accordance with the sessional order he has to ensure access to this house <e> <s> knowing the commissioner of the metropolitan police as well as i do i expect that he will be well able to complete both duties at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously this is a matter which can be discussed with the authorities of the house and particularly with black rod <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been very careful not to express any views about the westminster city council <e> <s> it is important i believe that when a council takes over responsibility it should come to its own judgment <e> <s> if the question was prejudged by me that would not be very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords since i was rude enough to be addressing a comment on some other matter when the noble baroness first spoke it enables me to get up and say that i apologise profusely to her for my rudeness <e> <s> i am extremely sorry <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> very well my lords that simply reinforces my point <e> <s> i am not interested in what other people say <e> <s> i am interested in what i myself believe to be correct and was brought up to believe which is what members in all parts of this house have been brought up to believe that if one is a member of the cabinet one treats its proceedings with confidentiality <e> <s> that i shall do as long as i remain in public life and long afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend answered that question <e> <s> he said that naturally any such decision will be reported to parliament <e> <s> it is perfectly obvious that if a decision is reported to parliament then it will be open to parliament thereafter to take any such action as it may wish to take <e> <s> that has been the position for a long time and it must remain so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it was right in the interests of the house when there was anxiety particularly on one side of the house to make sure that although it had gone on for a very long time it was proper to do so <e> <s> but i really do think that minutes is reasonable time <e> <s> i would have hoped that the noble lord who has had one go and who is not noticeable for his silence in the house would perhaps consider that on this occasion in the interests of the whole house and i am perhaps speaking for the whole house we have continued for long enough <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lady i was hoping that after the noble lord lord bruce of donington whose right to ask another queston i hope i recognised correctly it would be possible to move on <e> <s> had not i interpreted some feelings in the house i might have suggested earlier that we moved on <e> <s> but i thought that the matter was of such vital importance and there was such feeling in the house that i should have been wrong to do so <e> <s> i felt that was the feeling of the house <e> <s> perhaps after the noble lord lord bruce of donington has asked his question the moment for bringing this matter to an end will have come <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think that it would be wrong for me to go any further than i did in answer to the noble lord lord shepherd about the need to have the fullest discussion in the house <e> <s> i cannot give a guarantee as to exactly when the debate might take place because i might be proved wrong <e> <s> that is the last thing i would wish to do because i should have misled the house and that i do not intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords without referring any further to the noble earls suggestions many of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord also asked why it was not possible for the united states fleet aircraft to be used alone apart from the f-s <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> coming from him those words are extremely important <e> <s> he will certainly be heeded and i can most assuredly tell him that i shall see that his words are brought to the attention of anyone in this field who may have missed them because they are immensely important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for those figures which are no doubt accurate <e> <s> there are many people in this country and many people in other countries in the western democracies who feel that their leaders have been too slow to react to those particular incidents which have led to great loss of life and to great suffering for many of their peoples <e> <s> it is in response to that feeling and after i suspect having some instinct that he was not being as fully supported as he felt he ought to be so far as libya was concerned that the president of america decided that on this occasion in view of the provocation to american citizens and the loss of life to american citizens it was for him to take the particular action that he did <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord lord bottomley says <e> <s> no doubt those matters were closely taken into account by the president before he decided to take the action that he did <e> <s> the question that was put to her majestys government and i am sure that the noble lord who is extremely fair will appreciate this was whether once the president had decided that such action was on the whole vitally important as he believed it for the self-defence of america that was the moment when he asked not for their participation in that action in the strict military sense but for the support of the united kingdom government and the right to use those aircraft and crews of his own who were based in this country <e> <s> that is the part that we have played <e> <s> much of what the noble lord has said naturally arises for consideration for this government but also of course for our allies in america and throughout europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his last remark <e> <s> as to his first remark concerning the meeting of the european countries having given the answer to the noble baroness and others that i should like to see the closest co-operation with europe as her majestys government do i believe that it would be wrong for me to indulge in any recriminations at this stage as to what may or may not have been done by the european governments yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris raises many questions about the action which no doubt must have exercised us all <e> <s> they certainly exercised me during this time <e> <s> the noble lord has decided to come down on another side of the fence <e> <s> i believe that in the circumstances it was right for the united kingdom government to support the american government <e> <s> the noble lord deeply regrets that he cannot agree <e> <s> we have to consider both positions <e> <s> the noble lord has decided on a different decision to me <e> <s> that is his affair and i cannot answer for his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i can only say that that was certainly a consideration in the mind of her majestys government when they came to their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the word accomplice <e> <s> i do not accept what the noble lord says and therefore i do not think i have anything further to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he has raised many considerations all of which have to be taken into account when reaching a decision on this very difficult matter <e> <s> all of them of course were naturally in the mind of her majestys government during their deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord first asked about the agreement on british bases <e> <s> he will recall that this is based on the churchill-truman communiqu of which provides for joint decision by the two governments on the use in an emergency of the united states bases in the united kingdom <e> <s> that agreement remains in force and has been continued by successive governments since that date <e> <s> i think that is the answer <e> <s> there have been no qualifications of the communiqu <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the noble lords last point <e> <s> he has read me a considerable lecture and perhaps he has anticipated the speech he may seek to make when a full debate is held <e> <s> i do not think that at this moment i have anything to say in reply to those various points except to state that i cannot say when the debate will take place because that must be a matter for the usual channels and i do not wish to pre-empt them <e>", "<cs> my lords let me return the compliment and say that the noble lord is a wise and responsible person <e> <s> as such he must remember that while economic sanctions sometimes seem attractive and may be used in certain circumstances their record of solving disputes in the world is indeed a very poor one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i should go down that particular road even when it is suggested by someone as distinguished in diplomacy as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had answered that question directly in saying that in view of their role in the action that was a matter for the american government to answer and not for the british government to answer <e> <s> whether anyone should go to the security council must be a matter for the american administration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised two points with me <e> <s> first of all he has given some information to the house and certainly to me of which i was not aware <e> <s> nothing is more unwise than for someone answering for the government to comment on some information which he has never heard before <e> <s> i do not think your lordships would expect me to fall into that particular trap <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the government are unaware of this <e> <s> i was indeed aware of that matter but i do not quite see where it gets me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we last debated the televising of our proceedings in july last year <e> <s> on that occasion i said that we would have a full days debate on the question of whether or not to continue permanently with television once the select committee had reported <e> <s> the select committee has reported we have had our debate this afternoon and in a short time we shall reach a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords my own views on televising are well known to your lordships as i have expressed them in debate on previous occasions <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that i am not going to bore you again with them except to say that i have for a long time wanted to see the televising of parliament and i say advisedly of parliament <e> <s> nothing that has emerged from our experiment which has now been running for some months has led me to change my views <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that at the conclusion of mondays debate on the motion of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to continue the televising of our proceedings i undertook to move as soon as was practicable the motions which would be necessary to enable this to happen <e> <s> this first motion empowers the television authorites to televise and sets out certain criteria to be observed <e> <s> it follows very closely the motion of th july under which the sound broadcasting of the houses proceedings has been conducted with naturally appropriate modifications <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord henderson of brompton tells us that we may be committing some error of which we have all probably been utterly innocent in our belief that we were doing what is best it is my duty as leader of your lordships house to seek to take account of an important view <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that what i was suggesting i hope i was right was that the amendment should not be moved at this stage on my personal undertaking that i should look into the matter and seek to meet the will of the house and at the same time not offend any rule that the noble lord lord henderson of brompton thinks that we might infringe <e> <s> i must make it absolutely clear that i give an undertaking that i shall be personally responsible to the house to ensure that i shall seek to get this matter right in all the circumstances and express the will of the house on the one hand and not offend the rules on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the wish of the noble lord and of the noble lord lord ritchie i could not possibly stand in their way <e> <s> i could not advise my noble friends on the government front bench to resist in any way an amendment which i understood it to be the will of the house to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i understand that my noble friend lord holderness whose prayer the noble lord rightly says it is has been consulted and is happy for the private members bill to precede the prayer <e> <s> i hope that there will be no inconvenience caused by that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady seear for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i am grateful to them both as well for suggesting that we pursue many of the matters concerning south africa more fruitfully in the full debate that we are to have on friday <e> <s> perhaps for once i may say that maybe in the discussions through the usual channels in which both the noble lord and the noble baroness took part we have chosen rather a good time for our particular debate on that account following the european council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the first comment of the noble lord <e> <s> on his second point i think it is a clear declaration of intention <e> <s> perhaps when one wants those who work for one in a commission or civil service to do something the first thing one should do is give them a declaration of intent <e> <s> that is what i think the leaders of the countries concerned have done <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord first we have the communique from the community <e> <s> as yet we have had no meeting of the commonwealth and no communique from the commonwealth <e> <s> the only judgment which the noble lord has to which he is entitled is based on various statements made by various members of the commonwealth perhaps in relation to pretoria and other matters <e> <s> if everything in the world were governed by immediate statements by people all over the world and perhaps by ourselves before anything happened we should not get very far <e> <s> it is good to try to see what one can achieve and in some cases it is better to seek it that way than to go down the road of instant statements of one sort or another <e> <s> i know the noble lord will appreciate that it is important to do everything we can to try to overcome some of the prejudices <e> <s> no doubt statements will be made which may not be the whole truth when it comes to the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to respond to the noble lord in too much detail i might fall into the very trap i was previously lecturing the noble lord lord molloy about <e> <s> it would be unwise for me to make any other comment except to say that very much hope that when the plans are made for my right honourable and learned friends visit those whom it would be profitable for him to see will be prepared to see him and to discuss the problems in a very difficult situation <e> <s> many problems face all the people in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i do not accept the noble lords description of the measures proposed as a feather duster <e> <s> secondly i think i should make it clear that my right honourable and learned friend is going with the full authority of the whole community as the foreign secretary of the country which has the presidency at this time <e> <s> it is very important to say that <e> <s> it is therefore their view that there is value in this visit otherwise they would not have unanimously backed it <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must make it perfectly clear that we wish to see what will be the outcome of the mission <e> <s> that was made very clear in the communique and that remains the position of the british government <e>

would be wrong of me to reply now in detail to any other noble lord so i shall write to any of those to whom i have not replied properly during the debate and that will include the noble lord lord hatch on the point that he has raised with me <e> <s> i think that is the fairest way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course defer to the noble lord but i think i would have been in order to reply first <e> <s> however i defer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall seek to reply to the important remarks made by the noble lord lord cledwyn and indeed by the noble lord lord

goes for the government as goes for those people moving the amendments <e> <s> both have tended to get longer and i think we have to look at both <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i understand that perhaps i may seek to reply to some of the further points raised by noble lords <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy has made some perfectly correct points about the problems in previous years and i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> i must seek to shelter under those points to learn from the past because simply to go on repeating the mistakes of the past and in fact in some cases reinforcing them is not a good policy <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> he is perfectly right in what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords having spent two years in northern ireland i understand very well the intricacies of irish history and i do not propose to get involved in it either this afternoon nor during the celebrations <e> <s> however i think that three hundred years of anglo-dutch friendship is worth celebrating <e> <s> some of the aspects of the development of constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy which attend this event are also something which parliament should celebrate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that there are aspects of this particular occasion which may not evoke the happiest memories in different places and with different people <e> <s> certainly one of these has been put right in that my noble friend is now allowed to sit in this house despite anything that might have been done on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords a large number of people thought it was appropriate and that is why the government are supporting the various endeavours that are being made <e> <s> one has to say that those members of your lordships house who do not want to celebrate need not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the last point about judges being allowed to remain however they behave themselves is quite right <e> <s> the rest of what the noble lord lord annan says is obviously correct <e> <s> it shows that there are two feelings about history and the noble lord produces one which on this occasion i am very much prepared to support <e>", "<cs> my lords i have referred to the arrangements made by the william and mary tercentenary trust <e> <s> i understand that the advisory committee set up by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and mr speaker

parliamentary exhibition <e>", "<cs> my lords as is so often the case i am indeed grateful to the noble and learned lord for his detached wisdom in this matter <e> <s> i have thought it right so far as i was concerned all the time to keep right away from matters of religious controversy which when answering for the government is probably wise <e>", "<cs> my lords there might be two views on whether that was a good thing or not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that on my behalf my noble friend lord belstead moved the resolution in your lordships house yesterday afternoon and it was a resolution in line with what the government themselves put forward to another place <e> <s> your lordships felt able to agree to that resolution last night <e> <s> it is not for me to say whether in the circumstances the members of another place were right or wrong <e> <s> i merely confine myself to saying that they decided not to take the same view as the government that is something

your lordships have been most reasonable and modest in what you believe to be the way of carrying on the business of the house in circumstances very different from how it was originally proposed that it should work <e> <s> i believe that the country as a whole will see that the costs of running this house and the reimbursement of your lordships expenses are in the circumstances most reasonable

house <e> <s> this is something which i think is widely recognised and i am glad that your lordships feel it right that that should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i slightly misunderstood the point that the noble lord was making <e> <s> what he says is perfectly true <e> <s> but from what i divine from what he is saying i think that if i went too far down the road that he is suggesting

in responding to the noble lord <e> <s> i fully accept that there are certain difficulties <e> <s> a limited number of my noble friends have enormous responsibilities in looking after the affairs of

leadership i am glad because that is what i am put here for on behalf of your lordships <e> <s> i shall seek to use those qualities <e> <s> however over a very long life nobody seems to have thought that i had the qualities of a trade union leader <e>", "<cs> my lords that was one of the problems to which i was referring when i said that the load on your lordships and the extra amount of attention paid to your lordships business imposed a considerable extra burden on many members of the house <e> <s> i fully accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying a long way beyond the

the accommodation sufficient to do all the things that we want to do there is almost no way to overcome the problem <e> <s> we are still seeking to see whether we can do something to effect improvements <e>", "<cs> i suggested my lords that it was a very small majority <e> <s> it was more than one but not very much more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that it would normally be the case

think i ought to reply to something which the noble lord lord diamond said because there was perhaps some misunderstanding earlier when i mentioned the point to my noble friend <e> <s> i must make it perfectly clear that i have not yet created a precedent but i think it will only be to the acceptance of the house if my noble friend lord young were to say something tomorrow which was felt to be worthy of a statement to this house and if a statement to this house were wanted that it would obviously be proper for me as the only cabinet minister available to do it other than the lord chancellor to make that statement myself and that i will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider what the noble lord has said in all the circumstances that might come forward <e> <s> where another minister in that department was available i was not myself considering it right to do it <e> <s> it is simply the point that my noble friend lord young being in this house it seemed that i should certainly do it in his position <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for consideration and we shall see what comes up tomorrow or what might happen <e> <s> i shall certainly take account of what the noble lord said <e> <s> i could not commit myself to every possible statement that would go too far <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday i said in response to the noble lord lord cledwyn and others that i would consider making a statement today if the measures announced by my noble friend lord young seemed to justify a statement in this house <e> <s> i judge that it would be your lordships wish that i should make a statement this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to the noble baroness lady seear for their reception of the statement and indeed for the welcome that they have given to the measures i have announced this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord elliott of morpeth for what he has said with his very special knowledge of the extreme problems in the north-east <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for what he has said about the enterprise allowance <e> <s> at a time when we have to look to small businesses to help solve the unemployment problem what has been done through the enterprise allowance is extremely valuable <e> <s> i should add that i am afraid i cannot give the information for which the noble lord lord cledwyn asked about the number of people who having taken on businesses then gave them up but i shall certainly find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i would say simply this <e> <s> i considered that possibility with my noble friend and he would have been prepared to do so despite a considerable number of other engagements which he had at the party conference <e> <s> i make no secret of that fact <e> <s> i decided myself that i should do it rather than ask him to come back <e> <s> that was my decision not his <e> <s> i hope the house will see that it was not an unreasonable decision that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help the noble lord and the house in two ways <e> <s> first on the matter of a private notice question in accordance with the <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the noble lords opinion and it would immediately mean of course that i would be getting on to the substance of the matter if i agreed with him on it <e> <s> i simply say further to my first reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn that the government must be fully informed before they make a statement <e> <s> as will be perfectly clear there are a number of briefings and discussions now going on which will enable the government to be in that position on wednesday <e> <s> that is why i undertook to make the statement on wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords the first answer as i understand the position according to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay the house but i think i am being perfectly reasonable on this point <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet put down a private notice question which was in my judgment and as i made the decision obviously it would be in my judgment declined <e> <s> therefore after that it was for the noble lord to question my judgment if he so wished <e> <s> i understood that he did not and according to what he said when he rose i have to say to your lordships that he did not <e> <s> at that moment the noble lord cledwyn and i must emphasise this point because i think it makes the matter clear did not ask me a private notice question <e> <s> he exercised his prerogative as leader of the opposition to ask me a question about business <e> <s> i think that the two are different <e> <s> that is the reason behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always ready to be corrected in this as in any other matter but so far as i am concerned i did not hear the noble lord lord kennet dispute my decision on the private notice question and frankly i do not think that he did <e> <s> when he spoke later he was good enough to say that he did not <e> <s> therefore i think it was perfectly proper of me to proceed to the business question the private notice question having apparently been disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords on the whole then to conclude this discussion on a happy and non-controversial note everybody is satisfied with the prospect of a statement on wednesday and if we are all satisfied with that perhaps that should be the end of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that on wednesday it will not be a private notice question it will be a statement and therefore the house will have its opportunity to discuss a statement properly made by the government <e> <s> how we proceed thereafter is a matter for consideration no doubt through the usual channels in your lordships house but i have promised a statement on wednesday and that is as far as i think i should go today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can wholly accept many of the strictures that the noble lord has produced <e> <s> i cannot give him the details of amendments in previous sessions without a considerable amount of extra work which i do not think would necessarily be justified <e> <s> the noble lord says that the situation is unprecedented <e> <s> it may be <e> <s> i am not disputing that <e> <s> but neither he nor i can prove it <e> <s> i do not think that he would wish me to obtain all the statistics necessary to do so or not <e> <s> there are however a large number of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope that it will not <e> <s> i accept that there is a considerable burden <e> <s> i have not however noticed any lack of zeal on the part of people outside the government in putting down amendments <e> <s> for example on the financial services bill there were government amendments but amendments altogether <e> <s> so there is another per cent <e> <s> due to the zeal of your lordships <e> <s> on the national health service amendment bill there were three government amendments and from your lordships again an example of considerable zeal <e> <s> on the public order bill there were amendments from the government and from your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington will not mind i am sure if i touch upon the european communities amendment bill being discussed today <e> <s> on this bill the government have proposed no amendments while your lordships have put down again quite a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords it may do <e> <s> but of course at the same time what is the purpose of your lordships house as a revising chamber if it does not improve original bills <e> <s> there is a balance to be made <e> <s> i am not sure since the noble lord puts it this way that when he was in government he was in a white sheet any more than i am <e> <s> we both had our deficiencies <e> <s> perhaps we still have but there it is <e> <s> i believe that it has been worse on this occasion <e> <s> i accept from the noble lord that we must see that it does not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend who has done a great deal of work when he was in another place on the preparation of statutes which were extremely valuable <e> <s> i accept absolutely what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i would not wish in any way to appear complacent about the government <e> <s> if some of your lordships heard what i said to some of your colleagues about their bills your lordships would not find me in any way complacent <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be for me to make statements about the role of this house or how it seeks to follow that role <e> <s> after all i have been here for a very short time and would certainly not wish to pronounce on these questions <e> <s> i say only this <e> <s> yes i think that there is an argument that the government have relied too much on your lordships house in certain bills <e> <s> but if the bills are better as a result then probably that is part of the role of your lordships even if we have had to rely on it too much <e> <s> regarding the length for which we all speak in this house i suppose it is always possible for us to use a few less words than we do <e> <s> i hope that we shall all seek to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly prepared to discuss through the usual channels in this house how we deal with our own procedures <e> <s> having been involved in the procedure of both houses in my lifetime i am a little hesitant to get the two procedure committees together <e> <s> they might generate a great deal of paper and take a great deal of time <e> <s> i am not convinced that they would necessarily come to a satisfactory joint conclusion <e> <s> but i am certainly prepared to see how we can help <e>", "<cs> my lords if i gave those figures as a means of conferring blame or stricture then it would have been unfair <e> <s> i do not think i did so <e> <s> i gave them as facts <e> <s> as for getting a bill absolutely right at the beginning if there is any former minister sitting in your lordships house at this moment who could say that about any bill he had introduced i should be extremely surprised <e> <s> i do not think it would have been the right way because the wisdom of parliament is part of the reason why we take time on the legislative process <e> <s> there is no such thing as getting it absolutely right beforehand <e> <s> i have heard many arguments on a great many occasions that when government did not accept amendments to a bill it was a disgraceful affair because they were not paying attention to the wisdom of parliament <e> <s> again it is the old story of not being able to have it both ways <e>", "<cs> my lords such kind words from someone who has such experience of your lordships house and indeed of the constitution of parliament generally are very welcome indeed to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook that this would be considered <e> <s> i shall discuss it through the usual channels <e> <s> we shall see whether we can have an experiment on these lines <e> <s> i have heard two views from those who understand this house much better than i do <e> <s> there is always the problem that one may save some time by having a standing committee but then a great many people arrive fresh to the task for the report stage who there say i have not had a chance to put my point on the committee so i insist on doing it on report <e> <s> one may find therefore that when considering the time taken on both stages one does not gain very much <e> <s> however it is certainly worth trying and i do not mean to knock the argument down in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i shall look at what noble lords said at that time about a standing committee <e> <s> it depends very much upon the type of bill that is considered as to what happens afterwards <e> <s> one has to look at it on those grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords first my noble friend says that i made a cautious reply <e> <s> of necessity it is cautious because i am the servant of the house and it is not for me to make pronouncements <e> <s> it is for this house and for its procedure committee to decide <e> <s> if i were to make far-reaching announcements straight out <e>", "<cs> my lords while of course no one likes to admit that they have presided over a shambles and therefore the noble and learned lord would not expect me to do that i shall of course discuss this point through the usual channels and if necessary bring forward the appropriate committee for consideration of the matters in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion and it might be popular in the country except among the many people who approach your lordships from time to time demanding legislation on all sorts of different subjects <e> <s> would not many of those people who are constantly demanding more laws for this that and the next thing be extremely upset if they were always replied to in the negative <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there is no doubt that quantity is a major factor in the problem we are considering <e> <s> the fact is that again the quantity is not dictated because of course governments can stand against it but i have to say that pressure for more legislation on a wide variety of subjects is something of which every noble lord in this house knows very well indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept at once that the noble lord has some passing knowledge of procedure and practices from his time in another place <e> <s> i suppose the same could be said of me though people will begin to wonder more and more whether i have <e> <s> so far as the work of parliamentary draftsmen is concerned the fact is that the enormous amount of legislation which has come forward in recent years from all governments places a considerable strain on the parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> i believe they do an extremely good job for us and that ought to be accepted <e> <s> but if one presses them too much as i believe all governments have in recent years inevitably it detracts from the standards they have set themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i accept what the noble viscount says <e> <s> i should be very unwise if i did not do so <e> <s> whether that situation will he improved and carried forward in the future is not for me to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he said at the start and i entirely agree with what he said at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that i said nothing that did not show considerable appreciation for parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord with his considerable experience in these legal matters for having come forward to say so <e> <s> of course the answer is that the minister who brings forward legislation is responsible for it and frequently there is no doubt that either he or his department have failed to make themselves entirely clear in the first instance <e> <s> having been a minister and having brought forward legislation <e> <s> i am quite certain whatever else i may be guilty of that at one stage in my life i was certainly guilty of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord said about the ability available to this house to act as it is expected to do in our constitution as a revising chamber <e> <s> if we think we are not using that ability to the best effect the remedy lies in our own hands <e> <s> we can look to the procedure committee to decide how better we could use the ability which i think everyone would recognise lies in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i must hesitate in saying so but if the noble earl says so i think i am entitled to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> yes i shall certainly do as he says <e> <s> i accept the governments responsibility <e> <s> i am sure also that your lordships will understand and appreciate our own responsibility in these matters to make sure <e>", "<cs> my lords as i rose i heard the chief whip say that was very wide of the question <e> <s> however i trespass on that point just for a moment to say that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones before him have done a considerable amount in regard to consolidation measures <e> <s> they are owed a great debt of gratitude for the work they have promoted in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady serota be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord kennet for their reception of the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn first asked me several questions about trident <e> <s> i think i should first say that the agreement on trident is set out perfectly plainly in the statement <e> <s> of course our position so far as trident is concerned remains that it is part of the nato strategy it has been put before our nuclear allies earlier and it is perfectly clearly part of our particular strategy <e> <s> it is accepted by the united states government as such as well as by our nato allies <e> <s> that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i do not think that my right honourable friend and the president had any need to reconcile their differing views because after all they shared a very clear position of agreement <e> <s> first both governments totally abhor apartheid <e> <s> both governments wish to see further progress made by the south african government and will take steps to that end <e> <s> both governments are taking steps to that end <e> <s> we certainly are taking steps together with our european allies and these have been set out very plainly <e> <s> the americans have made perfectly clear their position and what steps they are taking and that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord thorneycroft for what he has said <e> <s> once more he has helped me as he has helped me so often in my political career and i am most grateful to him for the very important facts that he has expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may continue to press me as hard as he likes but i am not going to depart from the terms of the statement <e> <s> it would be quite wrong of me to do so <e> <s> i should have thought that up to feasibility was a perfectly clear statement and i stand by it <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last point of the noble lord lord gladwyn clearly the statement binds the president <e> <s> whether anyone in politics in this country in america or anywhere else can bind their successors over a period of time is a question which lord gladwyn knows a good deal more about than i do <e> <s> i should have thought that all that could have been expected was achieved <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord thorneycroft that a great deal was achieved in getting the presidents clear agreement with the position as it stands today <e> <s> i should have thought that was very important indeed to this country <e> <s> i do not think that anyone can slide away from that important factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords over the three days of this debate it has been clear that we begin this session in the spirit in which i hope and expect we shall go on one of constructive and courteous exchange of the differing views prevailing in your lordships house <e> <s> i am bound to say that i have time tonight to reply to some very thoughtful speeches on the general subject of employment and economic affairs <e> <s> that i will do <e> <s> i should dearly like to take on the noble lord lord williams on the broader matters of hope and political matters of a much more general nature <e> <s> that is perhaps rather more to my taste so he is fortunate that tonight i am kept firmly in the economic straitjacket where i shall remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn for his reception of the statement <e> <s> i do not know whether i should be grateful to the noble baroness lady seear because she did not want me to be grateful <e> <s> i should certainly be grateful to the noble baroness if she wanted me to be grateful but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor for the welcome which he has given to the job counselling proposals and some of the other measures on unemployment <e> <s> i agree very strongly with the noble lord when he stresses the importance of interest rates <e> <s> no doubt interest rates were discussed but as i was not present i cannot tell the noble lord exactly what was said <e> <s> i can only tell the noble lord what was in the communiqu <e> <s> however it is all part of the heads of governments consideration of the various proposals for growth of new jobs and recognises the measures which have already been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend lord auckland clearly this was a general discussion that took place and the heads of government naturally left it to the medical people concerned to follow up what had been said in general terms in the more detailed proposals which would certainly be necessary <e> <s> but of course they referred to a sustained information campaign on prevention and early warning in treatment and those are clearly vitally important matters <e> <s> they designated as the european cancer information year <e> <s> it will of course be for the medical experts to take considerable advantage of the lead given by the heads of government on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say to the noble baroness lady burton that i should have been very surprised indeed if she had not raised that point on cheaper air fares in view of the many questions she has properly asked on this subject in the past <e> <s> i think i can only take note of what she has said about the need which i know my right honourable friend the prime minister certainly recognises to do everything we can to make progress on this particular front <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that my right honourable friend is disappointed that we have not made greater progress so far <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on to her the remarks of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has properly recognised some of the measures which have already been agreed and adopted since july on this matter <e> <s> this is a considerable tribute to those of my right honourable friends who have been engaged in many councils <e> <s> i can say that because i have not been engaged in any of them <e> <s> those who have been have done a considerable amount to make progress on this important front <e> <s> but of course i could not give an answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not an omission because as i understand it the statement said <e>", "<cs> my lords personally i shall treasure the memory of his determination to play his part in this house even to the extent of staying to the early hours of the morning to the end of a debate in which we had both spoken an example perhaps to us all and an example of a great parliamentarian <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been generous enough to refer to some communications with me and indeed that is true <e> <s> he will be the first to understand that for me to have to suggest to him that what he is saying cannot go on too long is difficult <e> <s> my past associations with him my interest in this case with him all lead me to be totally lenient but i have my duty as leader of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can properly as leader of your lordships house confine myself to the point that i made and not seek to go further <e> <s> it was simply that if it was a question of deciding at this stage whether someone was guilty before he had been before the courts or indeed had had an opportunity of stating his case that is something that i am sure your lordships house would not wish to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i did take the responsibility which i think has been proved to be entirely correct of giving permission for a private notice question on this subject <e> <s> i think the house will agree that minutes on that particular private notice question is a proper amount and may probably feel that it has had a considerable discussion on this matter and that it would now be fair to allow a very important debate to come on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to those who still wish to enter this discussion but i feel that it has gone on long enough <e> <s> i think the house feels that we have had an amusing time over this question <e> <s> however i believe your lordships will wish to pass on to other business <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly no part of my business to be gratified one way of the other by what noble lords feel at any time <e> <s> my job is to interpret the wishes of the house and indeed the customs of the house as set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make my position absolutely clear <e> <s> i have only the power to see what the position is and to do everything i can to make sure that they are available <e> <s> i can go no further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend lord ferrier wished to point out that the discussion on this statement had gone on for too long <e> <s> i appreciate fully that it is an important subject but i must point out to your lordships that it has taken minutes and that is a great deal longer than we expect a statement should take in the middle of an important debate <e> <s> we must bear that in mind and perhaps we can now return to the debate <e>", "<cs> if i may say so to the noble lord lord ross of marnock i am not quite as well aware of the procedures in the other place as he is but very nearly <e> <s> i think therefore i could say that that possibility had crossed my mind as well and i was going to refer to it <e> <s> that is why i said hopefully <e> <s> it may not be exactly at half-past three <e>", "<cs> i do not think so <e> <s> we shall be embarked on i understand an important and long debate concerning students in the scottish rating bill and will take some time <e> <s> if the house wishes to continue for that time that is for the house to decide and it is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> if on the other hand the house wishes to have the statement first that would be possible only in the event that my right honourable friend has risen to speak before we start on the bill <e> <s> if not with the agreement of the noble earl lord perth and the committee it would be possible after the noble earl has moved his very important amendment for the house to resume at that point for the statement <e> <s> the other option is to wait until the whole debate on the student issue has been concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes such machinery exists <e> <s> however i have to point out to your lordships that once the noble earl lord perth has started to move his amendment it would not be proper to suggest that we should break in at least until he has finished his speech <e> <s> if noble lords wish to go through the whole debate so be it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement about the prime ministers visit to the soviet union which is being <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord diamond for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for their generous tributes to my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> i feel that she would be extremely grateful to have heard what they said and i believe that these expressions are justified by a very remarkable personal achievement <e> <s> to those who saw the pictures on television there can be no doubt of that and it is true to say that the various discussions were neither easy nor based on agreements between her and mr gorbachev at times <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for his remarks and for what he said about my right honourable friend the prime minister which i know will be a great pleasure to her <e> <s> on his two points i understand that basically he is correct on the chemical weapons front <e>

grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> not everything that is said in your lordships house or in either house of parliament is always fully supportive of the activities of the broadcasting organisations <e> <s> i am sure that on this occasion when they are getting such compliments and i must say that personally i think they are richly deserved they will be all the more pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful also to the noble lord lord gladwyn for what he has said and for the welcome which he has given to the visit of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for having expressed that feeling which i know the prime minister felt very strongly herself <e> <s> she will be very grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend says <e> <s> i think that we made the agreement so far as concerns the bbcs broadcasts <e> <s> i am in no position to go any further than that this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend was making clear something which she has made clear on many other occasions that in the present negotiations between the united states and the soviet union on arms control generally our nuclear deterrent which i understand is about per cent <e> <s> of the whole of the weapons concerned is certainly not included and is not negotiable in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord i fully appreciate that he wishes to question me but i think it right that i should answer first in the normal form of this house the noble lords who have spoken from the two front benches <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite improper for me to comment on the personal position of the noble lord which he has set before the house <e> <s> he will be the first to appreciate that when these matters were investigated in it was the view of his then prime minister the right honourable gentleman the member for cardiff south and penarth that there was nothing in the various allegations <e> <s> i understand from what he has said and i have to accept it that that does not satisfy him <e> <s> clearly it is not for me to pursue that matter further <e> <s> i can only say that i regret the understandable feelings that the noble lord has and i shall certainly see that his views are passed to the appropriate quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in accordance with the position that i have taken so far i think that it would be appropriate if i did not comment further on what he said <e> <s> above all i do not think it is for me to seek to second-guess not one prime minister but two <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only tell the noble lord that i said that i shall pass on the point that has been made by the noble lord lord glenamara to those who are most nearly responsible and i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord considers that i am being ingenuous in repeating the statement made by my right honourable friend the prime minister and associating with it the statements made by the right honourable member for cardiff south and penarth at that time <e> <s> i do not at all accept that am being ingenuous <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can only say that those who have a complete belief in the integrity of the director general have to take into account the advice he has given to my right honourable friend the prime minister that he has found no evidence of any truth in the allegations <e> <s> the statement says <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord i do not think it is a direct analogy <e> <s> whether i was right or wrong when i did that i have to say that some of the people concerned questioned whether i was questioning their integrity <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question that in view of the various allegations that were made the director general of the security services thought that that was right and proper and i know he conducted this inquiry entirely on his own account <e> <s> obviously he realised that he would have to report to my right honourable friend the prime minister on the many allegations that were coming forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say to the noble lord that taking it from the general position of all those who have expressed confidence in the director general i have considerable confidence in the security services of this country and so do a very large number of people in this country <e> <s> if the noble lord or anybody else were to say that because they found a mistake made by some organisation or some individual they did not have confidence in that organisation or individual over a broad field there would be very few things in this world in which one would have confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear in my original answer both these matters are confidential <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that i cannot give any assurance one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords that would not be a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not tempt me to depart from my original answer <e> <s> as these matters are confidential i do not wish to say anything one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not be tempted to break the rules which it is my duty to your lordships to help the house to follow <e> <s> that duty is not to answer questions which do not arise directly from the question on the order paper <e> <s> having said that i agree entirely with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that may all be very well but i have answered the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply did what i believed was my duty to your lordships <e> <s> i replied to a question that had been put down on the order paper and therefore had to be answered <e>", "<cs> my lords whether it is a confidential or non-confidential fact it does not arise from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords however that may be if they appear it is my duty to your lordships to answer them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to abide by the rules which the house has laid down on all of us and say that that question simply does not arise from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the third motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to endorse what the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady seear have said in congratulating my noble friends lady young and lord strathclyde on their speeches this afternoon <e> <s> it will of course have come as no surprise to any of us to hear such an eloquent and if i may say so businesslike speech from my noble friend lady young <e> <s> as both the noble lord and the noble baroness said so eloquently we are all very well aware of her great talents as a front bench spokesman when in government and in opposition during her time as leader of your lordships house and as minister of state at the foreign and commonwealth office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady serota be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for accepting and understanding what i said to him <e> <s> i hope that he will not put any further glosses on that understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement about the european council meeting in brussels which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady seear for their comments on the statement <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn for saying that he agreed with much of it <e>", "<cs> my lords if my words had the construction which the noble lord chooses to put upon them i obviously said something which was incorrect <e> <s> what i was trying to say and perhaps my noble friend will appreciate it was that if one gave an agreement at this stage before all the necessary preparatory work had been done and the exact arrangements for controlling the budget had been reached then one would be giving a blank cheque <e> <s> but of course at the moment that one comes to copenhagan there should be clear plans clear <e>", "<cs> my lords without necessarily following all the various hypotheses put forward by my noble friend i think there are very good reasons why it would be wrong at this stage to make clear commitments without having examined in great detail many of the problems some of which arise from what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i do not accept for one moment that this is a deplorable incident <e> <s> i can imagine the views that would have been expressed from many parts of your lordships house and from many parts of the country if the prime minister had come back having accepted a whole lot of proposals which were thoroughly unsatisfactory and which would have put grave burdens on this country to the detriment of our economy <e> <s> i cannot concede that a compromise of that nature however pleasing it might be to the other countries or to anybody else would have been in any way right in our national interest or indeed in the interests of the whole community <e> <s> i cannot understand how with his great experience the noble lord can suggest that a community which is totally broke is likely to be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point i was trying to work out while he was speaking whether i have spent more of my time in politics in a minority or in a majority <e> <s> i think that perhaps recent events have put me just on the winning side of being in a majority but i still have clear memories of being in a minority and i shall never forget them <e> <s> i hope that i can conduct my thoughts on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture is making a statement in another place some time in the near future in which he will outline the results of the agreements which were reached <e> <s> this statement was not taken in your lordships house but it will be repeated and will be available tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that from the noble lord <e> <s> of course it always depends on what the housewife is doing as to whether it is a matter of satisfaction to the male occupant of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that it was in order to study some of those questions particularly the position of some of the countries that have recently acceded to the community which had not at that stage been fully worked out that it was necessary to proceed to the next summit at copenhagen with a clear understanding of what was proposed as far as these matters were concerned <e>", "<cs> success <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that this house should pursue a constructive position throughout the sessions ahead <e> <s> i know that we will and i know that he will do the same <e> <s> as regards some of the points that he has raised i should like a little time to digest them <e> <s> i shall return to some of them when i have been through the rest of the debate because he has covered a very wide field <e> <s> being the accountant that he is he is quicker at figures than i so i shall take some time to appreciate it all <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the phrase old sweats on our side refers to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter or to me <e> <s> i suppose that it could refer to either of us <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always wise to take care with such wise people around one <e> <s> that can only be described as an incautious remark of mine but i was well picked up on it and i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i took into account all relevant circumstances including the fact that my noble friend had made a statement and answered questions on the matter in this house last week <e> <s> i decided that in the circumstances with all the engagements that were involved it was the right course to take <e> <s> i accept that i may have made a mistake <e> <s> i make many mistakes but i did it in the best of all possible interests <e> <s> i did what i believed to be right in the circumstances <e> <s> if i was wrong well i was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if that is the case <e> <s> i know that investigations were made through the usual channels to see whether this was appropriate and i understood that it was <e> <s> if it is not appropriate to all noble lords i can only apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the house will remember that last session i appointed a working group under the chairmanship of my noble friend the chairman of committees to consider the working of the house and to suggest ways in which it might be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that your lordships will expect me to start entering into the controversy surrounding the statement <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for accepting my apology for something which i felt was within my responsibility and which i should ensure happens in future <e> <s> i thought that i had already ensured that that would happen but as i apparently have not i shall certainly see that it does in the future <e> <s> that is why i made an apology <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the lords expenses motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware the terms of this motion reflect the recommendations of the top salaries review body which last april published its review of parliamentary secretarial allowances <e> <s> the tsrb also made certain other recommendations affecting the lords on the questions of short money and of a possible special secretarial allowance to active back-bench peers <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the house if in moving the lords expenses motion i say a few words on these other matters too <e>", "<cs> not on this occasion my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have taken part in this debate because we have had quite a wide range of views <e> <s> stemming from a fairly narrow subject we have broadened out our position and that all adds to the interest because it is to the background of what we are doing in detail that we need to look further <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the ministerial and other salaries order be approved <e> <s> this order increases salaries payable under the ministerial and other salaries act to ministers to salaried members of the opposition in both houses and to the speaker of the house of commons <e> <s> the new rates which are set out in the schedule to the order will take effect from st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should now like to repeat the statement on the commonwealth heads of government meeting in vancouver being made by my right honourable friend the prime minister in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady seear for their response to the statement <e> <s> just as they have done perhaps i should concentrate first on the central issue of sanctions for south africa <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn said that the conference was humiliating for britain <e> <s> he found the governments attitude deplorable <e> <s> on many occasions i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord cledwyn but he will not be surprised to learn that i do not agree with him on either of these points <e> <s> i do not consider that it is humiliating to stand up for what you believe to be right <e> <s> after all all the other countries of the commonwealth stand up for what they believe to be right and they are very forceful in making statements on their points of view <e> <s> if they are prepared to do that surely britain is entitled to do it too <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord whose knowledge experience and work in these areas i fully appreciate and admire surely it is better if it is on a matter of principle in which you believe strongly to be isolated rather than pretend to go along with something in which you do not believe <e> <s> if the british government do not believe that sanctions would be effective in the ending of apartheid i believe it is better for the health of the commonwealth if they honestly say so <e> <s> surely it is equally true that many of the other commonwealth countries are not slow to make all sorts of statements by which in many cases they distance themselves from other members of the commonwealth and are happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says about the merits and demerits of majorities and the rest <e> <s> having been many times in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is best in answer to my noble friend to confine oneself to saying that we are all most anxious to make sure that the peoples in that community which we have all known in the past should be able to get on together and should be able to resolve their problems <e> <s> the government will do everything that they can to help them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would ever be so unwise as to say in your lordships house at any moment that i had answered all the points <e> <s> if i used those words it was very <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only thank my noble and learned friend as i have reason to do on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only answer the noble lord by saying that we agreed to the nassau sanctions as a signal to south africa <e> <s> that is what we are continuing to support and what we have actually fulfilled to the letter <e> <s> we have done exactly what we said we would do <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend made it clear that she agreed to them as a signal to south africa <e> <s> she believes that they will continue to be a signal to south africa but she made it perfectly clear that she did not see that sanctions as a whole would be effective <e> <s> if the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have listened to every speech in this debate with considerable interest except for one one that i think i would have admired the most had i not for what perhaps might be described as good reasons slipped out of the house for a moment and that was the speech of the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn <e> <s> he said that as other people had made the points he was going to make he was not going to say any more <e> <s> how could i have asked for a better speech to have missed <e>", "<cs> he wants to keep it <e> <s> i am sorry i clearly got that quite wrong <e> <s> i do not know the answer to this point and i leave it very happily in the hands of the two chief whips <e> <s> but i have to say to your lordships that if the government could not put other business into the dinner hour it would clog up the legislation still further <e> <s> so if there is to be a dinner hour i think it is necessary to have some other business inserted in that place <e> <s> that is how it happens <e> <s> i have learned to be a good boy and believe that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard the chief whip make a point which i shall repeat i am not sure that it was a very good one <e> <s> it was that we thought that the pilotage bill was a mildly controversial one <e>", "<cs> that is why it was not a good point <e> <s> on questions and debates obviously as the noble lord lord ponsonby said we must try to keep question time brisk varied and topical <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton raised the very important question of our treatment of privatised industries at question time <e> <s> perhaps i could study that further and ask the procedure committee to look into it <e> <s> i take the point about the duty of ministers not to answer more than two questions and to keep their remarks brief as in particular my noble friend lord ferrers and the noble earl lord perth said <e> <s> i know that is right <e> <s> that is a very understandable fault on the part of ministers <e> <s> i constantly stress to them that it is very understandable <e> <s> they feel that they should give information because this house unlike another place wants to get information <e> <s> the other place never wanted information at question time but this house does want information <e> <s> consequently ministers feel that they should give information <e> <s> i notice from time to time if ministers do not give sufficient information that noble lords get up and ask why a minister has not answered a second point <e> <s> they say that they wish to have a perfectly good answer to a simple question and that it has not been given <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come in for just a moment because i think the correct word is paving and not consequential <e> <s> it is not just a form of words it is actually an important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords needless to say the house will appreciate that i have taken advice before saying what i am about to say <e> <s> no one would expect me to know this without first taking advice and it is perfectly plain and clear <e> <s> it is that in the normal way we discuss the paving amendments and that leads into discussions as regards the other amendments <e> <s> i understand that to be the normal way in which the house proceeds and the noble lord lord irvine has acted correctly if i may say so to the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> he acted upon the advice that was given to him at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to exacerbate the position any further <e> <s> i have done my best in difficult and i accept emotional circumstances to come to the decision which i feel the house expects of me <e> <s> i have done so and i hope the house will feel that it is better for me not to comment further <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house will feel that we should leave the matter there <e> <s> i understand the feelings of the noble lord on this issue at this time <e> <s> however it would not be proper for me to say any more than i have done because i should immediately transgress my position in the house which i do not want to do because i very much treasure that position <e> <s> it is my duty to act in what i believe to be the best interests of the house and to perform in accordance with the instructions given to me by the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about the stamina of noble lords <e> <s> sometimes i begin to wonder how their breath will hold up in some of their activities and perhaps a little less breath would be a good thing from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement about the european council which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to the noble baroness lady seear for their acceptance of the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn basically asked me first whether things will be better in february <e> <s> i can only say that my right honourable friend the prime minister feels that on this occasion considerable progress was made <e> <s> i give the same answer to the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter knows a great deal about these <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord gladwyn concludes that from what happened at copenhagen frankly i think he is wrong because at the same time his own noble friend the noble baroness lady seear said that she was glad to welcome the prime ministers more constructive attitude on this occasion <e> <s> so i think we have to get the whole thing together <e> <s> i believe that my right honourable friend is of course prepared provided that the major issues are answered and again the noble baroness lady seear said that she was very grateful to the prime minister for having resisted the oil and fats tax <e> <s> so that is not the sort of concession which i think the noble lord lord gladwyn would have wished this country to make <e> <s> i believe that concessions can be made when a clear programme and a clear plan have been worked out and i think it is simply because of the need to get a clear plan worked out that we have in the past made concessions to arrive at agreements <e> <s> of course with any programme which limits production throughout as diverse a community as we have with all the different forms of agriculture which the noble lord lord carter mentioned all countries have to make some concessions <e> <s> that will be the purpose of further argument and further detailed discussion in february <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i am sure that he is right <e> <s> there is no doubt about the problem which faces the european community particularly with the number of members and the diverse nature of the number of members in succeeding in that financial discipline <e> <s> however it is clearly vital to many of us who want to see the european community succeed that they get exactly the discipline about which my noble and learned friend has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend the leader of the house for not having been here to hear his announcement <e> <s> i rise at this <e>", "<cs> for the first time in years i speak today in parliament for myself not officially <e>", "<cs> my lords as the unfortunate home secretary who had the responsibility of introducing the previous bill in i think it would be reasonable for me to make a short plea to my <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in the discussion <e> <s> however having been the leader of your lordships house for some four years i believe that i should contribute briefly <e> <s> when i was a member of another place i was extremely jealous of its privileges <e> <s> when i came to your lordships house and had the great privilege of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been provoked <e> <s> i did not intend to take part in the debate but surprisingly for me i want to rise in answer to the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> i say surprisingly for me because i owe so much to him from the time when i was leader of your lordships house <e> <s> i think that his point and that made by the noble lord lord mishcon are completely misplaced <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who shares collective responsibility with my noble friend for the matter at issue today i do not know the answer any more than he does <e> <s> nor would i expect that he should know it <e> <s> i cannot accept that because he does not know the answer to a question of a very specialised nature put by my noble friend lord cockfield that means that either he or i is in any way complacent about the matter <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be far better if he were able to give a considered answer if my noble friend chooses to put down a question <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the house is becoming involved in a ridiculous tack because my noble friend has said that he will take back the matter for further discussion with his secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i feel very diffident about intervening in this debate today for two reasons <e> <s> first i was abroad at the time of second reading <e> <s> i was abroad on a holiday which i had promised my wife that we would undertake in february after years in government <e> <s> i had left the government and therefore i thought it right to go <e> <s> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i think it is all the worse that i should intervene in this debate <e>", "<cs> i should not like to feel that i have misused my position in any way and i hope the noble lord does not suggest that <e> <s> but i have to <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of the house perhaps i may briefly say this <e> <s> first as one of those who has believed consistently since the governments proposals were first put forward that any question of sale to the highest bidder without clear safeguards would endanger quality perhaps i may say that i welcome the safeguards which have been produced <e> <s> of course we shall need to study them very carefully but they are a step in the right direction <e> <s> those of us with experience of television in the past as i have were very worried indeed about sale to the highest bidder alone without safeguards <e> <s> i hope that the safeguards will prove sufficient although they should obviously be considered more carefully <e> <s> however initially one must welcome them <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady birk that i do not take her pessimistic view but perhaps she would not expect me wholly to do so <e> <s> i believe that the safeguards are important and i welcome them <e>", "<cs> my lords they have not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords in all parts of the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating the debate on charities and for his excellent speech if i may humbly say so which outlined clearly the whole problem <e> <s> he has considerable experience of the subject both from his distinguished career at the home office and thereafter his constant work in the house for charities <e> <s> i cannot match his experience or his knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e> <s> i trust that that bill will be in the next session of parliament <e> <s> no doubt many suggestions will be made in the debate about possible improvements for when the white paper is turned into a bill <e> <s> i want to stress just one point which i regard as of paramount importance and which will arise after the bill has become an act of parliament <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon has already referred to this aspect of what i want to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that anyone with experience of the home office over the years is bound to find that there is a great deal to welcome in the proposals put forward today <e> <s> on the whole i support them strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as chairman of the council for charity support i can tell him the chancellor of the exchequer and members of all parties that all charities will greatly welcome the measures that the chancellor announced in his budget yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who for many years had the responsibility of dealing with the prisons regret the long nature of these exchanges and the tone which appears to suggest that anyone in any particular party can be in a position to throw stones at anyone else about the conduct of the prison system <e> <s> i feel intensely humble about what i tried to do i believe that my predecessors and successors as home secretary feel the same <e> <s> i hope that we can conduct our affairs as regards the prisons and these dangerous situations in the knowledge that we are all guilty <e> <s> what is happening today is a result of this countrys failure as regards prisons not for or years but over or years <e> <s> it would be better if we acknowledged that and tried to deal with the situation together on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not perhaps taking rather too serious a view of the matter <e> <s> after all there have been ministers in all governments if i may say so who have taken jobs <e> <s> i can see two former prime ministers who saw some of their ministers properly take jobs after leaving their position in the government <e> <s> similarly there are others who have not done so <e>", "<cs> i have a small amount of experience of appointing people to exactly the bodies that we are discussing <e> <s> i have always been told that acts of parliament should not contain words that are unnecessary <e> <s> i cannot believe that the words in the amendment are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the advantages of your lordships house is that its members are shrewd people who can see through things quite easily <e> <s> hearing my noble friend lord stockton move his amendment one might have thought that it concerned nothing which was happening at the present time in television that it was all to do with some long-distance position in the future that it was obviously fair and that that was how it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am activated in this matter by my very great support for the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool <e> <s> there is very good reason for that support <e> <s> after all i was <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord lord dean of beswick said is my noble friend aware that in cumbria where i suppose i may be counted as knowing something of what is going on i can say that the efforts which bnfl have made are greatly appreciated and are reckoned to have been extremely good in all the difficult circumstances which it faces <e> <s> i hope i may tell the noble lord lord hatch that people in cumbria reckon that bnfl is doing a good job and that it is very valuable to them from an employment point of view in west cumbria <e> <s> the people there wish it to continue and they hope that other people will stop slighting those very good efforts to make it a success <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped to wait until a little later in the debate but what the noble lord lord boston said in response to my noble friend lord ferrers new proposals is very important <e> <s> i should like to reinforce what the noble lord lord boston said and make some comments as to why i think his remarks were so wise <e>"]
