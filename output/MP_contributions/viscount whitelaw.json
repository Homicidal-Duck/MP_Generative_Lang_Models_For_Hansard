["<cs> my lords i was not quite sure what the noble lord with his unrivalled knowledge of this house and indeed of parliament was going to produce for me <e> <s> on his first point no i do not think i would be deterred by that fact particularly since it happened such a long time ago <e> <s> on the second point i think it is really a matter for parliament <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that this is a parliamentary anniversary and that is why my answer that it is for both houses of parliament to decide to put it forward and not the government is i think in the circumstances a proper one <e> <s> on whether it would coincide with a general election and whether we made sure that there was a peaceful transition from one government to another i would agree with the noble lord that our system of government and in fact the system of both houses of parliament and i say that quite advisedly is something of which this country has every reason to be proud <e>", "<cs> my lords the moment my noble friend lord blake rose i knew he was going to teach me something and there is a great deal of opportunity for him to do so <e> <s> had i looked at the excellent brief i have been given i would have known that fact for myself but i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for having pointed it out to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall leave the noble lord to speak for himself on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say in answer to the noble lord that if any such celebration did come from the views of both houses of parliament then i do not doubt that that spirit of reconciliation and understanding would certainly be there <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to celebrate the existence of the noble viscount i am sure that is something that this house would surely wish to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to come to the moment when i had to admit that i did get a degree in history at one stage but when i begin to hear the noble lord lord blake and the noble lord lord beloff i recognise that my degree in history is not of the standing of theirs <e> <s> curiously enough i concentrated at that time on the french revolution of which i remember absolutely nothing at all today <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i am very grateful for the fact that the noble and learned lord was speaking in english <e> <s> had he been speaking as the last welsh-speaking lord chancellor i certainly would not have understood what he was saying <e> <s> as regards the celebration of the recovery of the great seal again i think that would be a matter for parliament and it might very well be worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords this shows the wisdom of my suggestion that if we are to proceed in this matter it should be by the decision of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be correct for me to say as i am always encouraging my colleagues to do that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes certainly <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lords and to others who raised this matter <e> <s> it was one of the points on which i thought i might cut down for lack of time but i shall certainly write to the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i appreciate what he says and i have a good deal of sympathy with it <e> <s> the problem that arises is how to deal with the situation and how to improve it <e> <s> as what i may term a long-standing old boy of the usual channels in another place i do not think that i could possibly accept some of the noble lords criticisms of the usual channels because after all they seek to serve us to the best of their ability and frequently in very difficult circumstances <e> <s> i do not know what alternative measures they could find <e> <s> if there are two statements we try whenever possible to take them together and so not interrupt the debate more than once <e> <s> in fact we try in every way to seek to avoid these interruptions and we would wish to do so <e> <s> but i am afraid that if as the noble lord himself says there are to be repetitions of statements from another place it becomes almost inevitable that we have to interrupt our debates <e> <s> we shall do our best to improve as much as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i would pay close attention to what is said by the noble lord who has outstanding experience of all these matters <e> <s> we do our very best to help <e> <s> we offer all statements made in another place to the opposition parties to see <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord has his responsibilities in regard to this matter and i gratefully acknowledge the fact that he is most helpful <e> <s> it would be possible to do what he suggests <e> <s> but i think that if the house was to agree to that it would have to be appreciated that on occasions it might be quite late before all three statements could be made together and that might in itself have disadvantages <e> <s> but i am sure that that suggestion too can be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to tread on that extremely delicate area except to say this <e> <s> if there was in the government a minister with direct responsibility who is also a member of your lordships house and of course there is such a person i refer to my noble friend the minister for the arts who wished to make a statement he would of course initiate it here immediately after questions <e> <s> the rest of us do not have that kind of direct responsibility and i do not think that what is suggested would be welcomed in another place <e> <s> for example perhaps i may put it at its most personal and crudest i do not think that my right honourable friend the prime minister would fancy my making a statement here before she made it in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept at once what the noble lord says <e> <s> i was not in another place for as long as was the noble lord and compared with him i have been in your lordships house for <e>", "<cs> my lords if that was the wish of your lordships house it would of course be perfectly possible <e> <s> but i believe that it is frequently the wish certainly of the opposition that statements should be repeated and we have always been prepared in government to respond to that wish if it is expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely accept that the noble lord is quite correct in saying that but if he will allow me i will come to his single change when i have dealt with some of the broader changes because i think i will also have to say that that single change in itself would lead to many of the disagreements which have occurred in the past <e> <s> however those are the reasons why so far any efforts to change the composition of your lordships house have always failed <e> <s> they have always failed and until a new situation occurs i believe that they are likely to do so <e> <s> therefore on the broadest front i must and do go along with the noble lord lord jenkins in saying that it has to be either by revolution or by all-party agreement <e> <s> on the broader front there is neither at the present time and therefore i do not think that the basis for a major change exists <e>"]
