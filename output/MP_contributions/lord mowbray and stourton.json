majority of drivers regard as reasonable <e> <s> experience of previous reductions in speed limits for purposes of fuel economy suggests that they achieve only very small savings <e> <s> drivers

grateful to the noble baroness she has really taken the words out of my mouth <e> <s> it is precisely because of the cost of double glazing that we think our resources can be better used <e> <s> there

house i knew him as a child and have continued to be amazed at the way in which he has advanced in public esteem and at the way in which he has enhanced so much in this field which we are discussing tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only quote to the noble lord some of his noble friends remarks all ministers of arts and their minions fight for arts <e> <s> the treasury does not always give way <e> <s> lord davies suggested that museums and galleries should in part count as educational establishments <e> <s> there are certain educational exemptions but it would be difficult to establish that museums and galleries are any more educational than concerts or performances of classical plays and so on <e> <s> local authorities are able to obtain relief on the running costs of local museums and of course on any tax involved in the purchase of new objects <e> <s> private museums have to pay tax on admission charges but they too may seek relief on objects purchased <e>", "<cs> no my lords the most cost-effective use of our limited resources is to secure the insulation of lofts and hot water tanks wherever this is practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point and it is a point i shall bring to my right honourable friends attention <e> <s> basically <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord in his last sentence answered the question <e> <s> i shall certainly advise my right honourable friends and they will note what he said but i expect the same answer will come back <e>", "<cs> my lords it was only a week ago today that the government started a new scheme allowing people in public authority housing to have this right to insulate their lofts <e> <s> as from that date a week ago today we have started a large advertising campaign especially in areas in the midlands where previously the take-up of the grant was not as great as we would have wished and we are strongly advising all local authorities to give every access possible <e> <s> furthermore for older and poorer people the new rules will allow people to get <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord is not back on his original question <e> <s> he is pushing at an open door if he wants to know what our wishes are we would wish everyone to live in as perfect a house as possible but what we are trying to do with our limited resources is to make sure that they get the best use possible of those limited resources <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been said that individual cases do not necessarily make good law <e> <s> one feels sad at these cases but the rules have always been there and they must apply before one can get something <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i explain the governments position on part ii of this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mais said in introducing the bill this part is being promoted by the city of london to enable the department of transport to acquire land in epping forest needed to build part of the m the london orbital route <e>", "<cs> my lords in the department of transport followed up about cases of unlicensed use of vehicles either by offering mitigated penalties or by prosecution through the courts <e> <s> the problem of evasion of vehicle excise duty is one of the major factors being considered in the governments review of the duty <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figure of to per cent <e> <s> which was given in the study undertaken by the previous government is correct it may well be but i should not like to guarantee that the amount involved would be somewhere between million and million <e> <s> i am in the tricky position of being at the dispatch box awaiting the review of my right honourable friend which will be available very shortly and i cannot anticipate what he is going <e>", "<cs> my lords this is much the same as i was saying to my right honourable friend <e> <s> the noble baroness will have heard that this is something which her right honourable friend was considering <e> <s> it has been considered very seriously by my right honourable friend and our review will be taking account of all these factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that per cent <e> <s> of the reports of excise evasion which come into the department are made by police and wardens <e> <s> i cannot at this moment break down those figures for my noble friend <e> <s> in respect of those figures mitigated penalties are offered which avoids going to the courts <e> <s> it may interest noble lords to know that magistrates are able to impose a fine of up to five times the amount of the licence evaded apart from payment of the licence fee which is to be collected <e> <s> so the fine which can be imposed is not inconsiderable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris knows about these matters only too well <e> <s> this is partly a home office matter and obviously the department of transport cannot deal with the way in which the police are ordered to do things <e> <s> on his first question about whether the statement will be made before christmas i am not empowered to say so but i should be very surprised if it were not <e> <s> i think that i can give confidence to the noble lord in that way <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is indeed the case and fines are usually imposed <e> <s> but the department of transport at swansea is limited in manpower and is therefore limited in the number of prosecutions that it is able to process <e>", "<cs> my lords the public inquiry into proposals by the british airports authority for expansion of the facilities at gatwick airport will open at crawley on th january next <e> <s> the government will announce their decision as soon as possible when they have fully considered the report of the inspector but it is too early to say when this will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can confirm to my noble friend and your lordships that the government are aware of all these factors <e> <s> as regards the inquiry he put to me about the increased facilities for aeroplanes the reports of the advisory committee on airports policy and the study group on south east airports have now been received and once printed will be published as soon as possible <e> <s> the governments conclusion on those reports will be made known without undue delay <e>", "<cs> my lords all the points made by the noble baroness are always interesting and important <e> <s> in this case it would be wrong for me to give any opinions or suggestions as to what the government might be thinking because we are awaiting advice <e> <s> we are open-minded and we want to get the decisions when we do make them right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> how much it will cost the government i am not quite clear about it will depend on the length of the inquiry and the number of representations made to it <e> <s> i think that west sussex county council will bear their costs and other bodies who wish to make representations will bear their costs <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i cannot answer the question more fully than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any decisions at all on these matters have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to put down a question to me on that point i shall get the answer <e> <s> i am not qualified to answer at present <e> <s> however any germane proposals which affect this inquiry can be raised at the inquiry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister of transport is continually considering suggested improvements and no doubt when the time is ripe may come forward with some proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i have asked the same question as my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye has asked me <e> <s> i was advised that it would be possible if the planes were bigger <e> <s> the airport can take larger planes <e>", "<cs> my lords as we would expect of him the noble lord lord paget of northampton has introduced this bill with his accustomed skill and persuasiveness and as he is surrounded by friends on all sides of the house he knows that he is able to win a certain amount of emotion just by speaking to the house <e> <s> we all sympathise with him in most of the things he says although we do not always agree with him <e> <s> he has produced a bill which has produced some extraordinary bed-fellows <e> <s> as the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby pointed out he and the noble lord lord paget are not normally considered to be bedfellows on the matter of the killing of foxes <e> <s> i believe that in another place the names of heller and kimball are linked which is an even more unlikely couple <e> <s> but that shows what an extraordinary bill we are dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is at present considering the need for higher standards of insulation and control of heating for domestic properties <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware there had been undue delay <e> <s> continual consultations on this matter take place within the department with many advisory bodies <e> <s> there are some interested bodies which have to be consulted and which are <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point completely <e> <s> perhaps when i used the word need it was badly phrased <e> <s> it is when the need is seen to make it compulsory <e> <s> any builder can build to a higher standard at the moment <e> <s> we do not want compulsorily to put more expense on builders <e> <s> sometimes having extra insulation can have other side effects <e> <s> we just want to be sure that we are not going to order something to be done which could have side effects <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord must not tempt me in this way <e> <s> they are giving us advice all the time and my right honourable friend is in receipt of all this advice all the time <e> <s> we have every intention of trying to conserve every bit of energy we can <e> <s> but we in this country do not have the same climate as the rest of europe we have a much greater humidity problem than any other country in europe and this makes us slightly exceptional <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked what the side effects are <e> <s> these are a very technical matter which i should not like to go into here <e> <s> we obviously want to conserve energy <e> <s> builders and authorities are allowed and are able to build to a higher standard than the minimum <e> <s> what noble lords are asking for is that the government should make a compulsory minimum standard without being absolutely convinced that everything involved is totally necessary <e> <s> let us be quite honest <e> <s> anyone can at this moment build to a higher standard if he wishes to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble viscount has completely misinterpreted what i said <e> <s> my initial answer said that my right honourable friend is at present considering the need <e> <s> let me remind noble lords that we have this year in june increased the non-domestic building minimum standards <e> <s> i think it probably quite reasonable to assume that my right honourable friend might come to the same conclusion with regard to domestic dwellings <e> <s> this is not a promise it is just a surmise <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously no government want to see buildings put up that will immediately need a great deal of money spent on them <e> <s> we want to have good buildings put up just as the noble lords government did but obviously we want to do it at reasonable cost and we want the cost-effectiveness of the insulation to be seen to he there <e>", "<cs> my lords a new programme of research has recently been started in conjunction with southampton university to establish methods of measuring spray and to test devices for reducing the amount thrown up by heavy lorries <e> <s> i fear that the results of research to date are disappointing and do not provide the basis for any <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that this problem has been with us for a long time and noble lords opposite when in office were dealing with this matter in the same way as i have been dealing with it <e> <s> it is true to say that this is not a british problem it is a world wide problem and despite the efforts being made by the united states and sweden in particular i understand they are not having any greater success than we are at present <e> <s> regulations can be made but unless one has the scientific data to prove they will achieve something they are not very helpful <e> <s> the best advice we give is that drivers should drive more slowly in such weather to make conditions safer for other road users <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather resent the implication that where road safety and death are an issue the department or any government department would conceal matters i do not think that is true <e> <s> we are trying to find the answer and i repeat that no country is having any great success in this matter which is common to all countries <e> <s> as soon as the road research laboratory and the university of southampton in conjunction with our officials can find some reasonable advice to produce to the government who can then issue orders to manufacturers to use such advice we shall do so but until we have scientific evidence to tell people what to do issuing orders is pointless <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for those comments my lords <e> <s> a different set of circumstances exist in the united states where if my memory serves me aright they have a universal speed limit of or mph <e> <s> we all know that if heavy goods vehicles indeed any vehicles keep their speed down to mph on occasions when heavy spray is caused the spray concealing the vision of vehicles behind largely disappears <e> <s> our trouble is that on motorways large lorries are allowed to travel up to mph whereas in america that is not the case so the problem here is rather greater than it is in the states <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble viscount my lords and the law as it stands if the house would like the details they are regulations and of the motor vehicle construction and use regulations already contains a general requirement for vehicles to be fitted with wings or other fittings which as far as practicable prevent mud and water from being thrown up by the wheels unless adequate protection is afforded by the body of the vehicle <e> <s> it is not possible to go further than that at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us will have sympathy with the noble lord in his observation and again i can only recommend to the road users especially those using heavy vehicles that they take note of the fact that courtesy is due not only to other road users but to pedestrians too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i have the full implication of my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> i might add however in regard to poor visibility that arising from bad observation in driving there are accidents a year though some of these may not arise from spray hazard but from fog <e>", "<cs> my lords no such claims have been made over the past five years in respect of loans from the national museums <e>", "<cs> my lords in the second reading debate in another place my right honourable friend indicated that if such matters were raised he would be willing to consider them during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that we can be very pleased and very proud that there has been such a good record in this respect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware there is a case at present namely the post-impressionist exhibition at burlington house <e> <s> at the moment it is a concession that the government are giving they are not statutorily bound to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful as my noble friend lord brookeborough asked for a government view to say that the department of the environment have examined this bill very carefully <e> <s> the secretary of state has reported to parliament about it and his points have been met in committee <e> <s> we have no remaining objections but it is of course for the promoters of this bill and my noble friend lord sandford to persuade parliament yourselves that the powers they are seeking in the bill are justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome on behalf of the government the committees decision to allow part ii of this bill <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity to reassure the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord leatherland that we have no plans for major new roads crossing the forest other than the one discussed in part ii of this bill <e> <s>

chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there are three ministers involved <e> <s> inspectors are eminent people from all walks of life <e> <s> they are chosen for their proven abilities their open-mindedness perception and judgment and also for their ability to assess reasoned argument and personal integrity <e> <s> i should like also to point out that inspectors like judges do not have to be professional experts in order to be able to assess the evidence of those who are <e>", "<cs> my lords the question referred only to england and i have no brief as to what would happen in scotland

be independent assessors <e> <s> i cannot find it in my brief i have so much but i think i am right in saying that out of something like inquiries in some cases the inspectors have differed from the departments suggestions and in of those cases the ministers concerned have upheld the inspectors objections <e>", "<cs> my lords the interim memorandum sets out both the previous administrations policy of encouraging bus availability and use and their most realistic estimate of what is likely to happen <e> <s> we support that aim though we are proposing better methods of attaining it <e> <s> we have endorsed the policy of using those forecasts as the basis for planning the trunk road system as they were compiled in the light of the findings of the advisory committee on trunk road assessment and we do not believe that planning should be based on unrealistic forecasts <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for past history too much but at present we seem to be approximately within the margins which we would have estimated <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as the

already listed on appendix i of the convention as being in danger of extinction <e> <s> commercial trade in it and its readily recognisable parts and derivatives should therefore have stopped in and between states party to the convention <e> <s> since not all party states enforce controls on by-products to the same degree usually due to differing views on what is readily recognisable the united kingdom with switzerland and the federal republic of germany prepared a list of parts and derivatives including rhinoceros horn which all parties would be expected to control <e> <s> this was considered by the convention at its meeting in costa rica last march but was not adopted <e> <s> the united kingdom has prohibited imports and exports of rhinoceros and their horns since except where otherwise permitted under the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right there has been an increase <e> <s> the legal trade from kenya in rhinoceros is believed to be less than the illegal trade <e> <s> however in fairness to our commonwealth colleague kenya i must say that the government there has not only signed the convention but has ratified it <e> <s> i have every belief that they are doing their best to stamp out this illegal trade <e> <s> furthermore i should like to tell my noble friend and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear that i understood the noble lord <e>

knowledge <e> <s> i must confess that it is contrary to what i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only suggest that if there is any remaining rhinoceros powder left in this country the noble lord should take a good dose of it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is every worry about the rhinoceros <e> <s> live ones have only been licensed for import for breeding purposes in this country in accordance with the terms of the washington convention on international trade in endangered species <e> <s> rhinoceros horns and skulls have only been allowed in for non-commercial purposes where they were already in ownership before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear the noble lord lord melchett say what he has about what the department of the environment is doing <e> <s> as the noble lord is probably aware we are already having arrangements in europe <e> <s> the eec is going to make the convention binding on all countries in the eec <e> <s> this is an educational matter for other countries as well as ourselves <e> <s> it is not in europe where we are primarily dealing with the prime offenders <e> <s> next year in when the full convention meets in new delhi there will be really a full high court judgment given on any offenders <e> <s> as i pointed out to my noble friend lord selkirk a moment ago these meetings the next one is next week in bonn deal with matters as they come up <e> <s> our experts and the standing committee are well aware of where the offenders lie and are doing their damndest to stop the thing <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right but with kenya uganda

of state confirmed a slum clearance compulsory purchase order made by the westminster city council in july <e> <s> at the same time he gave consent for the demolition of no <e> <s> and the other

gives me great pain to have to say no to my noble friend but i do not think i can give him any such encouragement because however much there may be a revival of interest i do not think it could justify the retaining of a house which is not of any great merit however distinguished the gentleman who lived there <e> <s> as i have said consent for this demolition was given as recently as july <e> <s> in this case the city council have a statutory duty to demolish the building and have this listed consent to do so <e> <s> it really does not make sense to issue directions requiring the council to consider preservation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl might be interested to know that the westminster city council have indicated that they would be prepared to incorporate the present plaque on the new building <e> <s> but i should like to say that the purpose of listing a building is to ensure that a building of special architectural or historical interest is not demolished

in a state of total disrepair and it was only no <e> <s> which was habitable <e> <s> the only reason why there has been the delay is the moving of the people concerned who want to be rehoused in that

the decisions of previous secretaries of state after public inquiries <e> <s> at the moment so far as i know the position is that we have not had any request from the greater london council or the westminster city council to reconsider <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the happier facts of life in this country is that on matters of artistic taste both parties have very similar views <e>", "<cs> order

my noble friend lord oneill of the maine last july that suggestion is part of the proposals which are being considered in the report and i am afraid it is improper for me to comment on them <e>",

construction and use regulations <e> <s> these apply to all vehicles using our roads <e> <s> the load that a trailer is permitted to carry also depends on the spacing of the axles <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend and other noble lords who are interested that we are all waiting eagerly for sir arthur armitages report because he and his assessors are going into this matter in very great depth

this country and we are able to turn away those which do not meet our regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of the environment and the department of transport have for long been trying to encourage local authorities to take action of this kind <e> <s> they have the powers <e> <s> the two departments concerned try to get bypasses and new routes but we have a democratic process in this country which allows people to object and those democratic rights have a slowing-up effect <e> <s> as regards the noble earls last question about the armitage report i do not know whether he is aware of its terms <e> <s> it was to undertake an independent inquiry on lorries people and the environment <e> <s> so i think that it covers all the points that he is worried about <e>", "<cs> my lords as

exactly the sort of problem he has been asked to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am sure the contents of this bill will be familiar to your lordships <e> <s> many of you will have watched with keen interest its progress through another place <e> <s> for my own part i am particularly happy to be associated with what is the first major piece of legislation on the preservation of the national heritage for more than years <e> <s> this bill if enacted will make a very significant contribution towards preserving our heritage a heritage which despite the valiant efforts of so many willing groups and individuals is continually at risk from the ravages of time and the cheque books of wealthy overseas buyers <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be to the convenience of the noble baroness and the house if i tell your lordships that the negotiations have been completed and the government and the owners solicitors are now involved in drawing up the final hand-over documents <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been most useful and constructive and i have listened with the greatest interest to all the speeches that have been made by noble lords in all parts of the house <e> <s> like other noble lords i wish at the outset to offer my warmest congratulations to the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon and the noble lady lady saltoun both of whom are good friends of mine and i have known lady saltoun and her husband for years <e> <s> it is clear that they will be in your lordships house a lot they will be most welcome here as they have been assured by all noble lords <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon in may <e> <s> in july we took a decision in principle to go ahead with what the noble baronesss government had decided namely to help and we were negotiating busily with the owner who probably quite rightly wanted certain conditions made <e> <s> we had to have certain valuations by experts of pictures and

department of the environment has given up this picture collection buying and the ownership of the pictures and the matter has been transferred to the arts and libraries section of the government

noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i fully appreciate that it is a splendid sports area <e> <s> however i must point out to the noble lord and to your lordships in general that listing is not there to

has been around since about <e> <s> it was looked at in depth again by the last government in and when we made our announcement in october it was declared that it really would be final because otherwise the glc and the developers would never know where they stand <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble lord has said <e> <s> however there was the local planning inquiry as he knows in <e> <s> it is really in the light of that inquiry that we are talking <e> <s> although i much regret the possible fate of any big building the facts are as i have stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat to the right reverend prelate that listing is not for social purposes <e> <s> my honourable friend mr monro has expressed the very clear view to the glc and to developers whoever they might be that if the development were to take place he hopes that at least square feet will be allocated for sporting purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is as aware as i am of the facts of the situation <e> <s> it is not for me to comment on whether the secretary of state in the last administration or my secretary of state overruled that particular gentleman <e> <s> i repeat listing does not take account of the social use of a building <e> <s> i must also repeat that obviously i am not an expert on listed buildings but one must take advice and this is what the secretaries of state have done both in the last government and my own government <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall most certainly bring this to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of all that the noble earl has said <e> <s> i am also aware that the was spent in the certain knowledge that the building would not be in use for more than five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bring all these matters to the attention of my right honourable friend and my friends in the glc but i hold out no confidence that they will in any way change their minds <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not intend to seek any powers in respect of the lveagh bequest kenwood but i cannot answer for the intentions of the greater london council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend has declared his interest because we in this country all owe a great debt of gratitude to his grandfather the first earl of iveagh for his very generous bequest to the nation <e> <s> on the question of the greater london council some proposals were put to them but a general powers bill for is shortly to be laid in this house and there is nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we have no intention at present of introducing any such museum charges <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord diplock and his noble and learned colleagues

policies set out in the report of the review of highway inquiry procedures which the previous administration undertook jointly with the council on tribunals <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that is true <e> <s> of course local need can be taken into account and inspectors welcome people pointing out to them how the national methodology to use that horrible word applies locally <e>

anyone can object to their application in a particular case <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord diplock said the methodology is a very complicated matter which the ordinary layman is not competent to deal with at an inquiry <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what the noble lord exaggeratedly calls wildly over-calculated is not necessarily the case <e> <s> there is a steady growth <e> <s> if there are mistakes then the people who conduct these matters learn by their mistakes <e> <s> parliament is the obvious forum for dealing with these matters and there is a permanent ongoing inquiry

m has priority in the governments thinking and we want to get it right <e> <s> we do not want any part of the m to affect local inhabitants badly if that can be avoided <e> <s> but national need is there and that is what is continually under assessment <e> <s> local objections must point out that the assessment about one place or another may not be satisfactory <e> <s> it is for the inspector to report and for my right honourable friend then to consider how to mould all these things together and issue a balanced judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble lord correctly i think that he is asking me about a particular case <e> <s> if i may look at the report of what he said i will write to him <e> <s> i do not know the answer at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept what the noble lord says and i totally agree with him <e> <s> the cost to the country of getting valuable goods from one part of the country to another is also an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i very

back with the views your lordships have expressed <e> <s> i take it the great silent majority is like the government not feeling very stongly one way or the other <e> <s> if that is not the case i hope noble lords will jump up quickly and inform the committee <e>", "<cs> i take it that would mean amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the idea behind the amendment of my noble friend lord reigate <e> <s> however the national heritage memorial fund trustees are as he has said an important body of people and appointment by the crown on the advice of the prime minister would

longer the practice even with bodies dare i say it much more important than this fund <e> <s> for the most part it would misrepresent the true situation as the prime minister and <e>", "<cs> i now have the facts regarding the british museum and the national gallery about which i was asked <e> <s> they were set up by statute long ago and those appointments are made under those statutes by the prime minister <e> <s> all the other bodies one may consider including the forestry commission are dealt with in fact by the departmental ministers concerned <e>", "<cs> in the face of the volume of advice supporting the amendment of my noble friend lord reigate i am perfectly prepared to take this amendment away and have it reconsidered <e> <s> i have a note here which says that we shall also be discussing this when we deal with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i revert to my argument and repeat that i shall take this matter back for further consideration <e> <s> however i should not like the committee to go away thinking that this heritage fund will be the be all and end all in the heritage world <e> <s> my two right honourable friends in a day-to-day advisory capacity are already interested in the major artistic historical heritage of this country <e> <s> all the committees and commissions are appointed by these ministers who have financial responsibility for the funding of all the museums the historic buildings council <e>", "<cs> i must say to my noble friend that the fund is intended to be able to operate as i said in the previous amendment over the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is going to have the difficult problem of achieving a balance in its assistance as between the different parts of the country and it will no doubt be criticised for tending to favour one region probably at the expense of others <e> <s> no doubt this criticism will be wholly unjustified but the trustees themselves would be much more vulnerable to criticism from those in one of the constituent countries of the united kingdom if that country did not have at least one trustee on the fund <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that these words which the noble lord lord reigate seeks to delete <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the answer to the noble lord lord winstanley would be supposing for the sake of argument and perish the thought my noble friend lord wemyss did not live at gosford in scotland but for whatever reason he might want to hand over to his son and he lived in london <e> <s> because he lived in london would not remove the fact that he was a scot of eminent distinction who knew all about scottish affairs and art <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord lord winstanley that or otherwise would cover that sort of case <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether my noble friend lord reigate is planning to take up residence in the channel islands or the isle of man <e> <s> it sounds as though he is trying to get a soft option on a trustee for one of those <e> <s> but they are not kingdoms or principalities as such <e> <s> i think we can leave those out <e> <s> or otherwise is a legal expression which is understood and for the purposes of common sense i think there will be no difficulty in interpreting this <e> <s> it is the secretary of state of the area concerned who will have the chief say in choosing his man and he can interpret or otherwise perfectly easily i should have thought <e>", "<cs> in face of the noble lord lord mishcon i hastily withdraw that or otherwise is a legal term <e> <s> all i say is that in the context we have here <e>", "<cs> it is merely anticipated that there would be one each <e> <s> however eminent the english secretary of state for the environment and the chancellor are there may be people in scotland who are suitable for trustees who are not known to them <e> <s> such people who might not be known to them would more than likely be known to the secretaries of state of the areas concerned

one of the trustees <e> <s> i think we are making very heavy weather of what is meant to be a helpful point <e>", "<cs> i will certainly take it away and have it looked at because i think we are all trying to arrive at the same result <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady birk knows as well as i do that never is not a word one can ever use in government <e> <s> all i can promise her is that the full million will be paid in on st april <e> <s> as i said on second reading that is the intention but i could not possibly give any guarantee that it will never be affected by future crises or expenditure crises <e>", "<cs> if as the noble baroness lady stedman says her party does its job right and helps us all the way round the clock to get the economy better i should probably be able to be more certain but i am not certain that she and her friends will do that <e> <s> our view of how to get the economy right and hers differ on some rather important points <e> <s> the noble baroness

the fund and the bookkeeping money has gone <e> <s> the million is all that is there and we really must be content with that <e>", "<cs> the trustees like everybody else will have to work from year to year <e>", "<cs> i fear that i am going to disappoint my noble friend lord sandford because we have to resist these amendments not i hasten to add because we do not totally agree with his intentions but because we do not think that they are necessary or that my noble friend is going about the matter in the right way <e> <s> the purpose of the amendments is to make it clear on the face of the bill that the trustees may give financial help towards the restoration of outstanding heritage items such as buildings land and pictures <e> <s> i am able to assure the committee that the amendments are quite unnecessary <e> <s> the possibility that the trustees might say wish to help with the restoration of an historic building is already allowed for in the terms acquire maintain or preserve <e> <s> these terms are construed very widely and the government are satisfied that they give the trustees power to discharge fully their responsibilities for preserving the heritage <e>", "<cs> let me start off by saying that in no way does anyone regard archaeology as a poor relation and let me quickly say to my noble friend lady vickers that i cannot conceive that the intention of this bill was to provide new wings for places like archaeological museums at devizes <e> <s> i should like to preface my remarks in that way because i think we are going off at a tangent if we start thinking of things like that <e>", "<cs> i did not say that historic meant prehistoric <e> <s> i said that historic did not exclude prehistoric <e>", "<cs> i had in effect said in my speech what the noble lord has said

dealing with advice to the trustees who are going to be helping to save objects of great historic and scientific interest <e> <s> there is no question of the trustees being taken to court <e> <s> this is merely a guideline to explain where their interest lies <e> <s> there is no problem here <e>", "<cs> this amendment has powerful support <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the speeches in support and i gather that the point at stake is that the trustees may wish to acquire rights over land without acquiring the land itself <e> <s> an obvious example is that given by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point but what we are worrying about really is what lies behind my noble friends amendment in that buying up rights in the surrounding area of country beyond what they own could be very hard indeed because it is very hard to know if you are thinking of a sanctuary and therefore buying up shooting and hunting rights how near the boundary would have to be <e> <s> for instance birds have to fly about and therefore an imponderable amount of discussion would be involved as to how much you would need to buy <e> <s> therefore if you start by buying a bit it is hardly worth buying at all <e>", "<cs> i quite agree that it is a very complicated matter and it is not helped by the slightly imperfect wording of the amendment but the last sentence that i read out to your lordships that is <e>", "<cs> the last sentence of my brief was as i read it out to your lordships but since then i have received further advice <e> <s> the committee <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble earl that i will take this back because i do seem to be advising your lordships that the trustees have rights while on the other hand i am saying that if they use those rights they will have to watch it <e> <s> therefore i will take this back and consider it further <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that it would cover that <e> <s> but i will take advice and confirm it and if i am wrong will write to the noble lady <e>", "<cs> it is really for the trustees <e> <s> but we must put out of our minds that this would be a usual occurrence <e> <s> if this were to happen it would be a most unusual occurrence <e> <s> but i have told my noble friend that i will take it back and look at it sympathetically <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee i can speak to amendment no <e> <s> of the noble duke and the noble earl and also to amendments nos <e> <s> and which stand in the names of the noble baronesses opposite and the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> as i have said i should like to take all these amendments together <e>", "<cs> we are not accepting amendment no <e> <s> but we are accepting amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the government do not envisage that the trustees will often wish to make use of their power to give assistance by way of a loan rather than a grant <e> <s> certainly we would not wish them to regard giving a loan as the easy option in marginal cases on the basis that over a period the money would be repaid so that in effect it could be recycled for heritage purposes <e> <s> it will be important that before giving a loan the trustees are fully satisfied that it will be repaid otherwise it is simply a grant by another name which clearly will not have been the trustees intention <e>", "<cs> i think there is one point that the committee have not fully grasped <e> <s> this is not meant to be the treasury acting as big brother stopping the trustees from using their powers <e> <s> the trustees are people of

where the treasury is reckoned to be useful <e> <s> it is the treasurys interest in whether it is financially prudent to make that loan <e> <s> they will not be particularly interested in the rates of interest it is the mere fact of whether it is a prudent loan <e> <s> it might be that their advice would be that these were not worthwhile people their cash flow was not suitable and it would have to be a grant or nothing <e>", "<cs> obviously the committee feels strongly on this <e> <s> the intent was good but i will take this back and have it looked at <e>", "<cs> the position here is similar to

the rule should be abolished <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not press me too hard on this question as i hope an announcement of the governments decision will be made before very long <e>", "<cs> this we think is an unnecessary amendment in that the law already provides that when objects are assessed for their pre-eminence they may be regarded as pre-eminent even if they are pre-eminent only in a particular setting <e> <s> this interpretation of the law has always been accepted by the treasury and there are cases currently in the pipeline which have been accepted under this interpretation <e> <s> however i accept that the amendment proposed here by the noble duke may be a useful clarification and i should like to have a further opportunity to study it with the benefit of the advice of the parliamentary draftsman <e>", "<cs> part ii of the bill transfers responsibility for acceptance of property in lieu of tax from the treasury to the secretary of state for the environment and the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and as the noble lord has said clause provides that if the government so decide they can transfer the responsibility on from the ministers to the national heritage fund trustees without recourse to any further primary legislation <e> <s> the transfer from the treasury to the departmental ministers will be a significant change which will be carefully monitored and once the new system has been in operation for a year or two and has settled down we shall review it to see whether it should be maintained under ministers or transferred on to the trustees <e> <s> in this review we shall have to consider the views of the various elements in the heritage world who it is well known as has been said do not all see eye to eye on this point <e>", "<cs> i am not

object to hare coursing but as the select committee pointed out to pass bills is not necessarily the best way to prevent cruelty <e> <s> the select committee suggested that a code of practice for hare coursing might be better <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a fair amount of experience of legislation over a number of years and although it is very easy to express sympathy for the hare it is

concern <e> <s> we think that the short-term and local consequences of deforestation may well be more serious <e> <s> nevertheless the possible global and long-term climatic effects are sufficiently serious to warrant more scientific investigation <e> <s> we have had british technical co-operation officers serving in brazil and the governments out there are most happy to accept our advice on some

structures which we are also debating <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him on having set afoot such a very good discussion as we have had especially with contributions from noble lords such as the noble lord lord peart who was one of the most popular ministers of agriculture this country has ever had and who has more knowledge than most of us <e>", "<cs> my lords the last time i went to the

purpose as the noble earl has said is to give the trustees discretion to acquire or accept gifts of property up to a certain value of the funds resources but at the same time to place a limit on the length of time the property may be retained <e> <s> as i made clear in committee we feel strongly that the trustees need not and should not have discretion in this particular matter and though we have carefully considered the point again we remain of that view for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on

water authorities have autonomy in managing their own affairs <e> <s> if they can do it without charging their customers too much we shall not stand in their way <e> <s> but in the present circumstances unless we can see our way ahead financially we are averse to ordering people to do it by bringing the act into operation at once <e>", "<cs> my lords we think on balance that it is right that the water industry should like others collect its own charges <e> <s> one has to remember that in fixing these charges water authorities are required under the water act to have regard to the cost of providing services <e> <s> consequently although domestic consumers are currently charged mainly on the basis of rateable value there needs to be scope for water authorities to adopt other systems such as two-part tariffs and metering <e> <s> water authorities have in fact made savings by direct billing and consumers are now better informed about charges for the services they receive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain of the implication of the noble viscounts last statement civil servants serve their ministries which serve the public and the public decide at general elections whether they are content <e> <s> as for what the noble viscount said in the earlier part of his supplementary which was more to the point there is no reason why water authorities which are authorities in themselves should not do their own billing <e> <s> electricity boards and gas boards do their own billing <e> <s> why should water boards not do their own billing <e> <s> there has never been any comparison with other services such as education and policing which are charged to the general rates <e> <s> i said in my main answer that there was a saving <e> <s> for instance the severn water authority estimates that its consumers alone have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain to what my noble friend was referring in the second part of that supplementary <e> <s> water authorities not only provide water purified clean and pure water such as very few countries have in such good supply but also have one of the best sewerage systems in the world and we should be proud of what we have <e> <s> the average family in this country is still on average paying only a week for all this service <e> <s> i do not think we need hide our heads in shame about this <e> <s> we are proud of what we have done in this sphere <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i am grateful to the noble lord for making that point <e> <s> the average council was charging about per cent <e> <s> of all the money taken from the public so the public were not getting a good bargain <e> <s> i must point out that local authorities should be reducing that amount which now the water boards are charging out of their own rates <e> <s> in other words the rates in general would have been higher had the water rates not been paid separately <e>", "<cs> my lords the water authorities in this <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment of the dog licensing system in northern ireland is the subject of an order in council at present being drafted <e> <s> the government are currently considering the question of dog licensing in the rest of the united kingdom along with the rest of the recommendations of the interdepartmental working party on dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble earl says to a certain extent <e> <s> actually it is not the same in great britain as in northern ireland at the moment <e> <s> for instance in the case of stock being worried by dogs at the moment farmers have no remedy in northern ireland <e> <s> this is part of a package which was in the pipeline when this government came to office <e> <s> we have allowed what you might call the continuation of the pipeline and let it see the light of day <e> <s> the situation is not the same in northern ireland as it is in england or wales at the moment and this is bringing it into line <e> <s> we are <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an interesting proposition that the noble lord has put to me but my brief does not cover it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am what you might call the very amoeba of the government the one-celled animal <e> <s> when we were in opposition i was able to give thought to these matters <e> <s> my right honourable friends and my noble friends who were in the shadow cabinet and are now in the cabinet were concentrating on bigger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend whose interest in dogs is well known <e> <s> when we get the answer we want to get it right <e> <s> it may interest noble lords to know that this proposed legislation for northern ireland which will be published in the form of a consultative document within the next eight weeks will include such matters as compulsion for dogs on the highways to be kept on leads and so on <e> <s> these matters are being considered carefully and we do not want a half-cocked act when with due consideration we can get the proper thing <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on the rate one considers and the starting date <e> <s> the northern ireland proposed licence fee is which we hope to have in effect by this time next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the government are looking at it <e> <s> i cannot promise early implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords it will depend upon the place of residence <e> <s> if in northern ireland it is there and if in the rest of great britain it will be as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a matter of policy <e> <s> the severn-trent water authority were authorised to build carsington reservoir by the secretary of state for the environment in the previous administration <e> <s> the reservoir is required to meet the estimated future needs for water in the leicester and nottingham areas <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment confirmed the previous decision <e> <s> the decision by the anglian water authority to stop pumping water into the empingham reservoir which i understand is nearly full is for the authority to take <e> <s> they will be saving a considerable sum of money by doing so <e> <s> however the authority will review the situation again over the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord is making statements to me or asking questions <e> <s> if he is making statements i do not agree with them <e> <s> what i can tell the house is that although there is a surplus of water at the moment at empingham there need not be a surplus if the anglian water authority do not pump all the time <e> <s> they can save in one year <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of the temporary job will be about million <e> <s> the cost of the permanent one will be about million <e> <s> as the million will be wasted in a few years time because it will not do the job anyhow surely it is better to do the long-term project <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord leatherland slightly followed my noble friends original question <e> <s> the fact is that empingham reservoir is very big about acres <e> <s> if the anglian water authority did not pump for one year it is estimated that the acreage which would become dry might be some acres round the circumference of that area of acres <e> <s> that could be topped up <e> <s> there is no reason for it to have mud-flats <e> <s> water in reservoirs goes up and down and reservoirs do not become mudflats <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reassuring the noble baroness that there will not be the mud-flats <e> <s> the water will not go down at once <e> <s> it will be a steady going down while the sun is out and the banks dry <e>", "<cs> my lords the anglian water authority are an independent water authority <e> <s> they have not been pumping since the beginning of this financial year <e> <s> however they could decide in july when they have their next meeting to discuss this matter to start pumping again for one or two <e>", "<cs> my lords the main purpose of the meeting was to consider detailed proposals concerning the work of the united nations environment programme in the coming year <e> <s> in addition a number of decisions were adopted <e> <s> i will arrange <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as usual has given me a blockbuster to answer <e> <s> we certainly support all environmental matters which are important to mankind and where the economics of the situation coincide we try to help as best we can <e> <s> the three specific questions that the noble lord asked are very difficult to answer <e> <s> we regard this environmental programme as having a catalytic effect <e> <s> we aim to help this united nations body and we assist it considerably <e> <s> the noble lord may remember that i answered a question on forests about three weeks ago <e> <s> we obviously draw the attention of our scientific advisers to this matter and advise the united nations agencies and other bodies interested <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway would be the first person to say that we had no right to interfere with a sovereign nations rights to manage its own natural resources <e> <s> this comes into the matter a little <e> <s> regarding the animals and plants i do not know specifically to what the noble lord refers but in principle we obviously would deplore such unfortunate happenings <e>", "<cs> my lords the working party on dogs recommended that local authorities should continue to use their powers to make by-laws to prevent fouling and to ban dogs from places such as childrens play areas but it is for authorities themselves to decide what resources they can devote to making and enforcing such by-laws <e>", "<cs> my lords a clearing up law would pose considerable difficulties and problems of public acceptance and enforceability <e> <s> we think that possibly it would be better to try to concentrate on preventing the fouling of places where the nuisance is being caused <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the prime minister said last week in another place it is a pity that dog owners do not take more trouble to see that their dogs do not foul and we ought to try to help to educate public opinion in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer i am sure is that there must have been some but i cannot give the noble lord chapter and verse <e> <s> however i can tell your lordships that it is open to any member of the public to institute prosecutions when they see such an offence taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords it has already been pointed out to me that this question has a sexual connotation but i do not want to go into that side of it <e>", "<cs> my lords we always know that the hardest people to control are our loved ones and the dog is mans best friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is horribly annoying <e> <s> i could not agree more <e> <s> enforcement is very hard <e> <s> local authorities can do more and the general public can do more <e>", "<cs> may i say something on behalf of the government about this <e> <s> as my noble friend lord bellwin indicated at second reading we have every sympathy with what the noble lord lord somers is trying to do <e> <s> we firmly wish to encourage the extensive planting of trees <e> <s> however as my noble friend said we cannot support this bill <e> <s> as my noble friend lord gisborough said however good the intentions behind the bill may be he thought it was a nonsense <e>", "<cs> the noble lord i am sure mistakenly <e>", "<cs> if i can ask indulgence to get up yet a third time i accept that <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i was rather making a second reading speech and i did intend to make it clear that i was putting the governments general view on the bill <e>", "<cs> there is one further point i would make <e> <s> if a tree were planted originally say a baby standard babies grow into big trees and sometimes one has seen occasions where a good tree had been planted but in totally the wrong place <e> <s> if this sort of measure became law we would have to perpetuate the same mistake for ever <e> <s> has the noble lord thought of that <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord is quite grasping the point i am making <e> <s> if you plant a chestnut of either the spanish or the horse-chestnut variety in a fairly narrow london street it is very nice when it is young but as it grows older it becomes bigger and bigger <e> <s> it is probably totally unsuitable to be in that place i am suggesting and therefore might not the council in its wisdom wish to have the discretion when it did fall or had to be cut to plant perhaps in its place some smaller tree <e> <s> it is not necessarily wrong to replace a hardwood with shall we say <e> <s> a cherry tree because it might have been that the hardwood grew to be too big and was therefore not suitable for longterm policy <e> <s> i only ask that because i do not like making statutory suggestions for something that might not be suitable in the long term <e> <s> in the countryside that would be all right but so far as towns are concerned i ask this <e> <s> does the noble lord think it always necessarily right to have to replace something which possibly would grow too big <e>", "<cs> if i appeared somewhat churlish to the noble lord lord kilbracken previously let me say that so far as this amendment is concerned i think it is a very useful relaxation of the points that he made in relation to my speech earlier <e>", "<cs> i should like to comfort the noble lord lord somers because i believe i detected a note of hurt in his voice <e> <s> we all appreciate what he is doing but for the reasons given by my noble friend lord cork and orrery and the noble lord lord kilbracken on amendment no <e> <s> to avoid having to perpetuate the mistake made by an earlier generation by planting <e>", "<cs> it looks to me as though in moving this amendment the noble earl is doing exactly what the noble lord lord somers and the committee have done in the previous amendment <e> <s> it seems to be totally unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i would congratulate the noble lord lord kilbracken on this amendment <e> <s> i think it is very sensible <e>", "<cs> i would have thought the noble lord lord inglewood has answered the point <e> <s> i would have thought that his suggestion meets the case <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say that if this register were to serve any useful purpose this is a very sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> if it is of any help the advice from my department is that either amendment no <e> <s> or the amendment of the noble earl would be an improvement on the bill as it stands and it does not really matter which one <e> <s> however obviously we cannot have both <e> <s> either of them would be suitable <e>", "<cs> although i spoke to what was the most common cause or the reason for it if one reads the words i think one finds that it covers those situations as well <e>", "<cs> i have an idea that that may be covered by some other provision <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble viscount on that point and if necessary if it is seen fit we shall add something at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this is really an amendment which your lordships would wish to see pressed <e> <s> i suggest that all that it possibly achieves is to exclude certain services where fares were less than some prescribed amount from any categorisation at all <e> <s> we used to have the magic figure of p <e> <s> there is no indication of what this prescribed amount in future is supposed to be <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to remove the requirement for a road service licence from certain presumably cheap local services <e> <s> i cannot believe that the opposition really wish to see licensing requirements for public buses dependent upon what fare is charged <e> <s> but it is still quite an intriguing thought <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said this matter was discussed in the house of commons and i thought my honourable friend the parliamentary secretary had rather the better of the argument <e> <s> i am slightly surprised <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill speaks very persuasively <e> <s> as he said my right honourable friend in another place indicated that there was not really very much between us on this matter <e> <s> it was discussed at great length in another place and we have fully accepted as the noble lord rightly said the principle of publishing details of all applications for road service licences <e> <s> but my right honourable friend said he was quite sure that the matter could best be dealt with by means of regulations as that is quite satisfactory at the moment <e> <s> it is in any case far more sensible i put it to your lordships to include such procedural matters in subordinate legislation <e> <s> they may need changing in the light of practice and regulations are sufficiently flexible to allow that <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady stedman was quite right in thinking that people should be able to know but i must have expressed myself rather badly <e> <s> i did say that as well as automatically going to local county and district levels of local authoritities copies are purchasable and large operators normally have standing orders for them <e> <s> what i obviously did not make clear was that the applications themselves are also available for public inspection at the offices of the commissioners <e> <s> any member of the public who is interested can go to local councils and get them <e> <s> there is no secrecy about that <e>", "<cs> that is a good question indeed <e> <s> but you have your local councillor and i should have thought that if you made it clear to him that you wished to be informed when such regulations were coming along he could see that you were informed <e>", "<cs> the noble lords last words are dear to my heart but i am not sure that his amendment will do precisely that <e> <s> i totally accept that he is concerned that applications for cross-boundary services should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible <e> <s> in practice traffic commissioners will still work closely together on such applications <e> <s> joint sittings will frequently be appropriate <e> <s> but we should not try to spell out the procedural details here and now <e> <s> it may be that the final decision will be to require applicants to copy their applications to the commissioners for all the relevant traffic areas but there are alternatives <e> <s> it may be simpler to require an application to be sent to only one area which the commissioners would then copy to all other areas <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> we have already established on the previous amendment that we all agree on the importance of publishing the details of applications for road service licences <e> <s> in addition to the notices which are published at frequent intervals by commissioners the applications themselves are available for public inspection at the offices of the commissioners <e> <s> this is already laid down in regulations it will continue to be so <e> <s> i hope that this will satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> it really is much the same principle as we were talking about on the last two amendments <e>", "<cs> i must complain the noble lord lord underhill has played a dirty trick <e> <s> assuming that he was addressing my noble friend lord bellwin i was in a nice state of oblivion thinking of the good dinner i had had but now i find i have to answer the noble lord <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord about minutes ago my answers to him this evening are somewhat on the lines of a theme song <e> <s> this matter has been discussed at great length in another place by the noble lords honourable and right honourable friends and by my honourable and right honourable friends <e> <s> we all agree that parties interested in the grant of a licence are obviously and most importantly interested in changes to the licence by variations in conditions <e> <s> regulations currently require commissioners either to publish proposals in <e>", "<cs> i wish to draw attention to the assurances that my noble friend the minister has given in the other place and that i have given to your lordships <e>", "<cs> with great respect would it not help to take no <e> <s> too <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is talking about amendment no <e> <s> but he is speaking about directly the whole time and that is in amendment no <e> <s> which he said he was not going to speak to <e>", "<cs> i think it would be a very special occasion to be celebrated as a special event in a feast day of the christian church <e> <s> i do apologise to the noble lord lord underhill for trying to persuade him to speak to <e>", "<cs> i would be less than honest if i let the beguiling and charming manner of the noble lord lord mishcon lead me to say that i would take it back and have it looked at because i must be quite honest and say this is not something which i am in the least bit able to take back and have looked at <e> <s> we think that the commissioners are competent to do this <e> <s> they themselves have to be satisfied that it is a special event and therefore it is within their competence <e>", "<cs> i have great respect for the noble lord lord mishcon as he knows <e> <s> having said that i do not believe that there is any chance of it being looked at <e> <s> i will of course look at what he has said <e> <s> i will have it discussed by the experts the officials and if there is anything in the noble lords arguments of course we will have a look at it behind the scenes <e> <s> i merely do not want to give any impression that i am going to come back with anything but i will have it looked at <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not able to satisfy my noble friend <e> <s> i am merely told that there <e>", "<cs> i said without giving any promises at all that t would have it looked at and that i will do <e> <s> as i said if the letter is of sufficient interest i will have a copy of it put in the library or alternatively it could be sent to noble lords who are interested <e> <s> i cannot promise there will be any concession because my advice is that we are fairly convinced that we are right in this case <e>", "<cs> as i said on the last amendment i am convinced that the procedure provided in the clause gives ample protection for local bus services and that what the amendment seeks would increase licensing controls and bureaucracy to no purpose and make the man who wants to provide simple leisure services go through quite unnecessary hoops <e> <s> deleting the word directly enormously increases the scope for argument <e> <s> there is some sort of competition between very distant things for example between the cinema and home decorating and an excursion to a place of interest can attract some people who would otherwise go to bingo or travel on the local bus <e> <s> but so can a television programme <e> <s> the word directly prevents such far-fetched arguments from being relevant <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will see the force of these rather simple points and will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords domestic consumers in the malvern area already have water meters in their homes and elsewhere there are some domestic consumers who for special reasons receive a measured water supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point <e> <s> water rates are calculated at the moment on a rateable value basis and of course that basically hurts the owners of higher rated buildings <e> <s> i agree that it is hard on people who do not have a water supply <e> <s> nevertheless having said all that as i have on previous occasions water and the removal of sewage is still one of the cheapest services in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of high interest rates i am not quite clear what the noble baroness is talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness knows the government are dedicated to reducing the high rates of interesteventually they will come down when inflation comes down <e> <s> to turn to the more immediate point of the cost of meters the exercise of assessing the cost of metering everybody was last done in and the cost then was between million and million <e> <s> that figure is now out of date <e> <s> the anglian and welsh water authorities which are giving people the option of having meters in the near future propose to charge approximately per household to instal a meter <e> <s> there is no suggestion of compulsion as regards the metering schemeit will be an optional scheme if people think that they are being charged too much <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not sure that that follows <e> <s> let me take the example of a large building with a very high rateable value <e> <s> the building might have few people living in itit might have just the odd washbasins and lavatories for shoppers passers-by or what have you but that would not reflect in the rateable value <e> <s> the cost of a meter and a standing charge would be of much better value to the owner of that place than if he were to retain the present system <e> <s> the object is to give people a choice of whichever system they think will suit them best <e>", "<cs> my lords we are an ever-increasing consumer of water <e> <s> it is not good enough to pretend that by saving per cent <e> <s> all parts of the country will not need new reservoirs <e> <s> i take the noble earls point <e> <s> obviously when one has to pay for something one looks rather more closely at whether the tap is running or the lawn needs watering <e> <s> but each water authority is its own master in these matters and it has to pay its costs itself <e> <s> we do not subsidise it <e> <s> each water authority can make its own charges <e>", "<cs> my lords the water authorities are there to supply water to us the public <e> <s> if we waste water we are the naughty ones <e> <s> the water authorities cannot be blamed for the public wasting water <e>", "<cs> the three noble lords who have tabled amendments have spoken to them and explained just what they seek to do <e> <s> i also understand that this is a matter about which the confederation of passenger transport feels quite strongly <e> <s> obviously we in the government welcome the interest which is being shown in saving paper work and bureaucracy and i pay tribute to noble lords on all sides of the committee who have this in view <e> <s> however timeless road service licences i agree would allow services to be made but there are some advantages in having regular renewal procedures <e> <s> the bill as it is will make it easier for new applicants to obtain licences <e> <s> the competition they would afford established operators is we believe a healthy discipline a challenge but we fully recognise that there may be routes where the commissioners are satisfied that it would not be in the public interest to grant more than one or two licences <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i have not got the exact information on the noble lords first question about the amount which would be saved <e> <s> there obviously would be a saving i agree <e> <s> i think that the arguments are finely balanced <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out that it need not be an open- ended perpetuity situation <e> <s> it might appear to be that but the arguments are finely balanced and what he has said has obvious truth in it <e> <s> i will if my noble friends will allow me take this back and have a look at it again because there is no absolute right or wrong at all <e> <s> the arguments are finely balanced indeed <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any great difference between noble lords and the government on this amendment which is on the very important point of annual testing of public service vehicles <e> <s> i totally appreciate the desire of all noble lords opposite and noble lords on this side of the committee to see such a requirement written into this bill <e> <s> however this amendment would pose a number of difficulties <e> <s> it is not of itself sufficient to set up a scheme for the annual testing of public service vehicles and it is moreover unsatisfactory in that it would oblige us always to have a different set of regulations for public service vehicles from those applying to other large passenger vehicles <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that its incorporation in clause will not produce regulations relating to the testing of public service vehicles one jot more quickly or more certainly <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment is i suggest with great humility slightly illogical because the bill is only providing for a vehicle to be detained during the time actually necessary for inspection <e> <s> but how can an examiner be expected to know whether a public service vehicle in service constitutes a hazard if he cannot even detain it for inspection <e> <s> in any case although i have every sympathy with the noble lords concern for the convenience of the travelling public i cannot believe that an amendment of the kind proposed is really necessary <e> <s> i do not really think <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble lords desire to have readily understandable legislation <e> <s> as a simple non-legal-minded peer i have always wished myself that it would be made easier and i am sure that that applies to everybody in the country <e> <s> however i am advised that this amendment does not appear to make any material change to the sense of subsection <e> <s> the subsection would still provide that aprohibition may be imposed with a direction as to inspection of the vehicle at an official psv testing station <e> <s> that is a provision that we regard as important for ensuring that vehicle examiners can check properly that vehicles are fit for service <e> <s> there is nothing between us here <e> <s> in some cases it will only be possible at places where a full range of equipment is available <e> <s> but it does not seem that noble lords opposite dissent from that general principle <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those kind words of the noble lord <e> <s> as regards his wording we have no really great objection to it since we do not think that it is going to change the effect very much <e> <s> on the other hand it might be thought to introduce an element of tautology and we do not see any great advantage in moving from the current formulation <e> <s> i shall certainly take it back and ask my learned friends in the drafting section whether they can find words to meet the noble lords common-sense reaction to them <e> <s> i shall certainly undertake to do that <e> <s> whether he will be able to do so i do not know <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill has said the object of this amendment is to establish beyond doubt that operators premises can be used for the testing of public service vehicles <e> <s> on this central point i would reiterate completely the assurances given by my right honourable friends in another place that we are committed to the principle of designating operators premises <e> <s> there is no fundamental difference between us there <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that any premises designated by the government would <e>", "<cs> we have here a small but important point <e> <s> this is part of the government philosophy of trying to make matters easier especially in rural areas so as to enable a man who runs perhaps a taxi service or a small hire car business to run a mini-bus too <e> <s> this sub-paragraph in the bill continues a derogation from the access directive allowed to us by the community <e> <s> the sort of operation referred to is the taxi or hire car proprietor who also runs a few minibuses <e> <s> under the present law he does not require standard public service vehicle licences for these minibuses <e> <s> the bill will not require him to have a standard operators licence <e> <s> the amendment would <e> <s> i do not wish to impose on him the need to satisfy the professional competence requirement when the access directive itself does not <e> <s> we want to encourage hire car proprietors to run a minibus or two they can provide a real service in rural areas <e> <s> i simply do not accept that <e>", "<cs> it is at first a little difficult to understand what noble lords seek to achieve with these amendments <e> <s> they are hardly drafting amendments since they appear to import some idea of an operators licence authorising particular vehicles <e> <s> but this is not of course how the provisions on operators licensing proceed and the amendments would not of themselves seem to change anything but merely perhaps to add confusion <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his very useful amendment which i quite agree adds greater clarity to this subsection and on behalf of the government i am very pleased to accept it <e> <s> with regard to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i had not updated my notes <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> after that rather lengthy introduction what i now have to say is that this is really only a small group of amendments <e> <s> the word company is now used throughout part i of the bill and related schedules <e> <s> it is defined by the amendment to clause page line as meaning body corporate <e> <s> it is therefore not limited to united kingdom companies and the need for a term undertaking in this schedule and its definition at the end of the schedule now disappears <e> <s> this block of amendments makes for a simple and consistent terminology <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i can promise that the noble lord will receive a letter from me before report stage <e> <s> i do not know the further details of the community directive <e> <s> i know the gist of it <e> <s> the advice from my department is that this is a matter which will be left to the traffic commissioners discretion because it is thought one cannot cover every possibility <e> <s> that is why i gave merely some examples <e> <s> i think that the kind of case referred to by the noble lord will also be left to the traffic commissioners discretion <e>", "<cs> once again i am grateful to my noble <e>", "<cs> these are important matters of course and the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> and my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> also tie up with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all these amendments overlook the fact that the wording of the bill reflects the terms of the eec access directive / which as we have said requires an applicant to fulfil the conditions of good repute financial standing and professional competence as set out in schedule <e> <s> if the applicant cannot claim professional competence or is a company rather than an individual there must be a transport manager who is of good repute and profes <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look at it and i hope the noble lord will look at my speech in detail <e> <s> i think if he looks at the small print in my speech he may see that some of the words are covered <e> <s> but i

up to the standard at which they can embark on a degree course however do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i will write to my noble friend on that point <e> <s> if anybody else is interested they can have a

here about providing for high talent in music and dancing we have to recognise on the one hand the special role of local education authorities in identifying and assessing need and of course the quite special funding by means of direct grant at the yehudi menuhin and royal ballet lower school to which i have already referred <e> <s> my noble friend lady young is currently considering with great care the case made to her for similar funding for pupils at three other music schools and they can expect an answer from her before very long <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are continuing to

do everything <e> <s> we undertake only to give a prod to people to show them the way and to help them a little <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said we are leaving it to the local authorities

circulars to all industrial builders and users <e> <s> we cannot do more <e> <s> we are not a complete nanny and mummy to industry we leave them to do something for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords industry is trying to cut its own costs to save its own money <e> <s> heating buildings and keeping them cold in summer is expensive <e> <s> therefore it is in industrys own interest to use insulation and it will do what is wise from the point of view of its own pocket <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not <e> <s> i also do not agree that local authorities do not know how to build houses <e>", "<cs>

into a little of the substance of what i wrote <e>", "<cs> my lords you will remember that when we discussed this matter in committee we agreed to look again very carefully at the arguments <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon asked then what estimate had been made of the savings which would accrue from a change from five years to timeless licences <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give him a precise figure but i am advised that the amount would be small and would not of course appear at all until <e> <s> there would continue to be variations and if we charged fees for variations as my noble friend lord morris suggested in committee there would be costs involved in the very administration of fee collection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friends magical advisory touch is not going to convince my advisers on this occasion although we completely understand the reasoning behind his amendment which he explained at the committee stage and again usefully today <e> <s> he was concerned that the use of the preposition with in relation to the expiry date of a licence in clause was rather pedantic especially when the word on was used in other places in the bill <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the use of the phrase the date with which it is to expire is quite deliberate in this case <e> <s> it avoids any doubts arising as to whether the licence expires at the beginning or the end of the day <e> <s> the word with makes it clear that the licence expires at the same time as the date ceases to exist that is at midnight on the day in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i always hate having to address your lordships in order to answer two legal gentlemen when i have no legal knowledge at all <e> <s> we had a fairly full debate in committee as to the merits or otherwise of the phrase as soon as is practicable <e> <s> i said then that i felt it was more appropriate in this case than a time limit <e> <s> i have however carefully considered with my learned and wise colleagues in the department the arguments for and against introducing a time limit of any length but have concluded that there would be no merit in this <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most important point because although it seems small it raises matters which worry passengers and your lordships have shown that you are thinking about their problems <e> <s> nevertheless i must confess that i am not going to be able to advise the house to accept this amendment because it is going to require to retain just what we are trying to avoid the whole paraphernalia of conductors licensing

because although the sentiments expressed by the noble baroness and the noble lord lord evans are in themselves admirable and are sentiments with which i totally concur as my noble friend lord sandford has said it is really totally unnecessary to move this amendment to give effect to them because this amendment would apply to any council dwelling that was part of a listed building or was in a conservation area <e> <s> it would exclude the tenant of any such dwelling from the right to buy his home <e> <s> as i have said i share the anxiety of the noble baroness to preserve the character

what my noble friend lord hylton has said in moving his amendment <e> <s> i am pleased to tell him that it is unnecessary because the bill already ensures that when a dwelling is valued under clause the valuation is made on the assumption that there is a willing purchaser <e> <s> this is implicit in the phrase on the open market in subsection <e> <s> i am sure that some buyers on the open market have had their arms ruthlessly twisted by wives and families but they will never be anything but willing purchasers in the sense intended by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords where local circumstances warrant it there is already power under the road traffic regulation act for the appropriate authority to impose such a prohibition by order on a specified length of road <e> <s> the

do where there is a need for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate on this matter and i am most grateful to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls in particular for his forceful comments <e> <s> as the noble baroness explained to us these amendments would vary the discount sharing provision in clause so that a purchaser under the right to buy was liable to repay a proportion of the discount for the years following his purchase <e> <s> this would double the period of liability and the amount repayable would diminish by per cent <e> <s> stages rather than by per cent <e> <s> as clause at present provides <e> <s> thus not only would the purchaser have this liability for longer he would have to pay back more discount if he disposed of his property in a way which triggered off the discount sharing charge <e>", "<cs> i am not sure i have all the points the noble baroness has in mind <e> <s> it is true that some children will have spent some time as adult members of their parents households before moving away to become secure tenants in their own right <e> <s> on the other hand of course they will have been accumulating periods of entitlement to the right to buy and to discount in their own right ever since they did so and a discretionary power will accordingly be of less significance to them <e> <s> i accept that a small number of deserving cases may be excluded from the discretion we propose but the fact is that we have confined the provision to tenants who have succeeded a parent as secure tenants of the same dwelling because we believe that only a limited discount concession in particular could be justified on financial grounds and because we believe that the provision as it stands will cover the great majority of the most deserving cases <e> <s> i am delighted again to be able to confirm to the noble baroness that as under the sex discrimination act the terms his and her will be effective in this

to buy and wants to complete the sale <e> <s> as the noble lord lord evans explained the amendments are not compatible with each other the second would amend what the first would leave out but the effect of the first amendment would be that the bill no longer explicitly gave a tenant a remedy through the courts if the landlord failed to complete the transfer of the dwelling-house to him as soon as the transaction was far enough advanced <e> <s> it could cast doubt on the ability of the county court to entertain proceedings to enforce the statutory duty imposed on a landlord by clause of the

listen <e> <s> in the meantime i would ask for the amendment to be withdrawn so that if necessary we can discuss it further <e>", "<cs> this is one of the cases we would be happy to discuss with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i was very interested to hear what the noble lord said about his amendment <e> <s> like him we regard the improvement for sale scheme as extremely important <e> <s> it will

shorten our debate if i were to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> taken together they would fundamentally change the existing statutory provisions relating to unfit housing <e> <s> the first

in relation to the report stage and third reading of this bill in your lordships house i do not think i can give any promise of hope <e>", "<cs> the purpose of paragraph of schedule taken with clause is to remove a statutory obligation on local government which has been found to be redundant an obligation to prepare and submit proposals to the minister for the provision of new houses

the opposition want to apply <e> <s> incidentally if i may gently tease the noble baronesss tail i should add that her partys bill did not contain any such provision either <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems a long time ago but when i was answering amendment no <e> <s> i made a slight mistake <e> <s> in my first paragraph i correctly referred to amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s>

and amendment no <e> <s> second <e> <s> i therefore ask that noble lords will take note of this in their records and accept my apologies <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord bellwin recognised when we discussed this amendment previously that the principle behind this amendment is that on the break-up of a family a pubic sector landlord should be able to evict the tenant partner in order to reinstate the other or because the other partner has been rehoused elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords am i really understanding my noble friend correctly <e> <s> is he saying that he wishes landlords to have the right to take decisions on these matters rather than the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always terrified at this time of night of expressing too much of what one has been told but when this provision was discussed at committee we discovered for our own satisfaction how many tenants might be at risk from this amendment which i think is what the noble lord is wanting to know <e> <s> i gather it is not possible to give any reliable estimate <e> <s> however in only a small minority of cases under per cent <e> <s> does a family member succeed to a tenancy at present <e> <s> some of these will not qualify as succession under the bill because the one succession will have already been used up <e> <s> not all will be seriously under-occupied and not all landlords will have a suitable alternative to offer <e> <s> only a very small number will be within the scope of the amendment and will be in the category of the most vulnerable <e> <s> i hope that this may give the noble lord the information he wants <e> <s> i do not think it is a serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave may i say that i welcome my noble friend lord hylton back into the fold of the conservative party in realising that we are a christian philosophical party wishing to do good <e> <s> i think that if the noble baroness lady denington thinks about it she will find we are not as hard as she imagines <e>", "<cs> my lords after that exciting display of calm and bravery on your lordships and your ladyships part following that fall of debris i think we can congratulate ourselves on our calm <e> <s> no bombs have exploded no firearms have gone off <e> <s> my only sadness is my noble friend the chief whip was about to wrap himself up in a blanket <e> <s> he has got it out <e> <s> i do not

implications which the tenants right to improve could have <e> <s> he has also sought to alter the factors to which the court shall have regard in determining whether a landlord was reasonable in refusing consent to an improvement <e> <s> but my belief is that he has over-stressed the risks here whereas i would emphasise the positive benefits of tenants improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords i must still emphasise the importance with which we regard the tenants right to improve the house <e> <s> we regard this as an important matter <e> <s> with regard to these two amendments in our view there is no need to draw the courts attention particularly to internal layout or external appearance <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord however that we see it as a very important principle for tenants especially council tenants to have a right to decorate and to do internal alterations <e> <s> there are too many council estates painted in the same uniform colours and we want people to have a real chance of changing all that <e> <s> where questions of internal layout or external appearance are relevant to the case before the court it will be able to take such points into account and in our view no amendment is needed to emphasise this <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to my two noble friends with great interest on the arguments with which they introduced this amendment and i do agree with the noble baroness lady birk rather introduced at the last moment on a totally new topic <e> <s> i agree with so much of what the noble baroness said that this matter deals with issues of very great sensitivity and with an area of very considerable complexity <e> <s> for these reasons we have to exercise the very greatest care to ensure that we are not mislead into thinking that with a few hasty and apparently simple strokes we can neatly dispose of the issue <e> <s> i do not believe there is any simple solution here at all <e> <s> the interaction between this proposal the european community legislation dealing with freedom of movement the right to take up employment and the entitlement to rights and benefits of all citizens of member states and the race relations act must be explored

in rather general terms <e> <s> it might help your lordships understanding of a somewhat technical subject if i also explain a little of the background of the rehabilitation order provisions to which the amendment refers as we in the government see them <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers is quite right <e> <s> at the committee stage we said that we would take this away <e> <s> we had much persuasion and eloquence from all sides of your lordships house on this <e> <s> we have given it further consideration and i am very pleased to be able to inform my noble friend and your lordships that having taken it away we are content to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords first i can assure the noble lord lord bruce of donington that i have very little modest serenity when speaking to experts on their own subject <e> <s> i know my limitations only too well and chartered accountancy has always been a subject on which i hate to say i am not an expert i wish i were <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect can we leave amendment no <e> <s> out please <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to the noble lord for explaining the meaning and intention of this amendment <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to reassure him having checked the position very carefully with our advisers that we are satisfied that the present wording of clause meets the point which he has raised <e> <s> on clause i hate to say it to the noble lord he is being so kind and nice but we think it would be unhelpful and again i hate to say it undesirable <e> <s> i should explain that the words we are concerned with do not rigorously constrain the scope of schedule to which we shall be coming in a moment rather they provide an indication of what the reader will find when he turns to the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i have to stand up and risk the censure of the noble lord opposite warning me of what will happen in legal cases to come when the governments advice on this bill has been proved wrong <e> <s> i can only say that his legal and financial advisers who i am sure are the most eminent of men are in conflict with the legal and financial advisers who are advising us <e> <s> therefore i have to put to the noble lord and the house what our advisers despite having had the advice of the noble lord still persevere in advising <e>", "<cs> my lords may i politely ask the noble earl to talk into the microphone a little louder because the box is totally unable to hear what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i do see the point of amendment no <e> <s> a and i do not dissent from the objective <e> <s> i would draw the attention of your lordships house to the definition of a tenancy in section of the leasehold reform act <e> <s> a tenancy there means a tenancy at law or in equity <e> <s> i am assured that the words tenancy in equity cover the situation where there is an enforceable contract to grant a tenancy <e> <s> it follows therefore that a tenancy granted after th april as a result of an enforceable contract entered into before that date will not be affected by the proposal in paragraph consequently there is no need for this amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord is satisfied on that point perhaps he would withdraw his amendment but i am grateful to him for giving me this chance to explain the point to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of amendment is evidently to enable a housing co-operative which owns the long lease of a house to buy the freehold under the terms of the leasehold reform act in circumstances where the house is divided into self-contained flats and each tenant is a member of the co-operative and has the right to acquire an extended lease on fair terms <e> <s> the act does not apply to individual flats and is tailored to deal solely with the case of an individual long leaseholder of a house <e> <s> i do not think it would be appropriate to use it in this way and to attempt to do so might give rise to all sorts of practical difficulties <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent a co-operative or any other association of long leaseholders from purchasing the freehold of a house or a block of flats if the freeholder is willing to sell to them <e> <s> i understand that there are several cases where this has already happened but i see no case for giving special rights to co-operatives to buy out freeholders <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that would be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady vickers for going to the trouble of tabling these amendments again so that the house can see the form that was originally intended <e> <s> i thank her too for her detailed explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say that we have every sympathy as i said with what my noble friend and the right reverend prelate are proposing <e> <s> but although we agree that it is a good and proper thing to aim for better standards if it is going to be done at the cost of putting more people on the homeless list we think it could at this moment of time be counterproductive <e> <s> as soon as the situation changes the government will alter their plans <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank the noble lord lord gifford for the very helpful way in which he has advised us as to what he should like to see done in some of these cases <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for management <e> <s> it is up to the british railways board and individual airport authorities to decide whether they need to improve their public address announcements <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail like your lordships in this chamber are trying constantly to

was going to address us in welsh <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords the boards which run the great airport authorities and the railways have people who are called acoustic consultants <e> <s> perhaps if the ceiling in our chamber takes much longer your lordships may need to go to these acoustic consultants as well <e>", "<cs> my lords these traffic orders are extremely simple in themselves but they refer to three different conventions and two supplementary agreements and when one goes into the whole they become totally complicated and involved <e> <s> i should like to read what the noble viscount lord simon said because i did not hear it completely <e> <s> i will undertake to write to him on his points <e> <s> i think that rather than dart about i might help both noble lords and i

of the bill is to confirm an order enabling the great yarmouth borough council to sell or lease all or part of the wellington pier at great yarmouth <e> <s> the borough council has been the statutory undertaker for and owners of the wellington pier since the turn of the century but their ownership has unfortunately become unprofitabe as the costs of maintaining and operating the pier have outpaced the receipts <e> <s> it is a burden to them and to their ratepayers <e> <s> the pier has prospects of success however and in the borough councils judgment these would be improved if the borough council could sell or lease all or part of the pier undertaking <e> <s> as things stand at present however they cannot lease the undertaking for more than three years nor can they sell it <e> <s> they have therefore promoted the order that is scheduled to this bill its effect would be to remove these statutory limitations on their commercial freedom of action <e> <s> the order has been publicly advertised and there were no objectors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has quite rightly taken my point that the brighton west pier and this pier are not the same <e>

to obtain authority <e> <s> suppose for the sake of argument the ncc have a mental obstruction at some moment and do not give permission <e> <s> i agree it is unlikely but nevertheless we are giving them an absolute power if they so wish <e>", "<cs> the government had an amendment down which they did not move <e> <s> i refer to amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to know whether when we speak about subsection <e>", "<cs> i apologise for raising another point earlier before the committee had finished discussing fish <e> <s> when we are dealing in clause <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend not slightly leading me astray <e> <s> i am talking about game birds on ones own land land which one is farming or otherwise owning i am not talking about what happens when they have flown elsewhere <e>

with his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was slightly frightened i was about to say alarmed but that it too strong a word by what my noble friend lord ferrers said a moment ago about the pine marten that because it was not to his mind sufficiently in danger of becoming extinct he saw no necessity for it to go into schedule <e> <s> the red squirrel is at the moment in no danger of becoming extinct but it is rapidly being squeezed <e> <s> as we all know the grey squirrel is not a very friendly animal to his cousin the red squirrel if it is his cousin <e> <s> we really should do everything possible to encourage its protection <e> <s> i can see no reason why anyone should want ever to kill a red squirrel <e> <s> i can understand it being taken for a zoo by certain methods but for killing the red <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend tell me where his advisers have ever found the red squirrel to be a pest <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain your lordships for more than half a moment because most of the points have been made <e> <s> but i should like to support my noble friend lord glenkinglas <e> <s> nobody likes snaring because it is snaring <e> <s> but at the moment it is an essential way of doing something in a practical manlier on large parts of hill country <e> <s> my noble friend said that if you can find other ways of doing something without needing three extra men well and good <e> <s> but if you abolish snaring in these areas there is one point which must be thought about <e> <s> the farmers will not want to see a great increase in vermin <e> <s> they will use poison even more than they do now <e> <s> there is great danger of poisoning many more animals than you intend to kill <e> <s> the indiscriminate abolishing of the snare before there are satisfactory ways of killing vermin will lead to illegal and greater use of poisons <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds to that perhaps i may say that i agree absolutely with what my noble friend lord drumalbyn has said about the capercaillie but i would be equally horrified if some noble lord who had a grey squirrel farm were for some extraordinary reasons to go around distributing them further afield than they are already although they are actually in the wild <e> <s> so i do not think that the fact that something is in the wild already should stop us discouraging people from letting out more <e> <s> i think the capercaillie is a case on its own <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord avon for what he has told us especially for the assurance that he has given about coming back to us about the suggestion of my noble friend lord chelwood of an enabling power for an order <e> <s> as my noble friend lord craigton has already informed us we shall have second and third bites at this particular cherry on committee on the fourth or fifth days or both <e> <s> bearing that in mind i shall in one moment withdraw the amendment for the time being <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be in any way derogatory about this amendment because i totally support the principle lying behind it <e> <s> but if we passed this amendment into law we should be in danger of putting a lot of innocent people at risk <e> <s> there are so many bits of ivory which are legally entering world markets <e> <s> elephants die and tusks come onto the market legally and if every tradesman dealing in ivory had to prove that he had a perfect right to it it would put an enormous onus on him <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i too should like to support what my noble friends have said <e> <s> i appreciate what my noble friend lord onslow has said <e> <s> i am sure that the government are well aware of my noble friends words of wisdom but it is slightly annoying that their actions are dragging behind what is necessary <e> <s> surely it would be practical for the government to table amendments before their noble friends and the opposition do so for them <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support what my noble friends lord home and lord gibson-watt have said about this <e> <s> when the noble lord lord donaldson said that the last people who want these powers are the ncc he was speaking words of gospel

enemies they do not want <e> <s> you will give them powers they do not want <e>", "<cs> a fortnight ago less five hours i moved an amendment which was slightly different from this one <e> <s> it was rather involved but i spelt out the details <e> <s> the amendment put forward today by my noble friend lord craigton is a simpler one <e> <s> to put it mildy i am very disappointed that my noble friend on behalf of the government has not been able to give us any comfort after days of thinking over the matter <e> <s> he has brought us back to where we were with a rather inconsequential consultation document comments on which do not have to be in until august <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend in answer to the noble lord lord gladwyn say he understood that there were very few imports <e> <s> am i wrong in recalling that some time <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like strongly to endorse my noble friends moving of this amendment and the noble lord lord kilbracken has taken words out of my mouth <e> <s> i think the timber question is really quite small <e> <s> when you consider the damage caused by deer the amount of damage done by young caper is so infinitesimally small

lords i took the lord kilbrackens point <e> <s> most of our early english snipe emigrate for him and his friends to shoot in ireland <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett was insinuating that the ones

birds because they are found in awkward places and therefore are not the most popular to get at <e> <s> surely a lot of these snipe do not survive into winter anyhow <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby will allow me to intervene i would say that my noble friend has asked me to apologise on his behalf <e> <s> he has an appointment in scotland and he has had to depart to catch his train <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest that the noble lord lord houghton whose heart i sympathise with is perhaps slightly under a misapprehension that small children with these

not be used for birds <e> <s> i have not myself any knowledge of anyone who allows his children to have such weapons who would dream of allowing his children to do such things <e> <s> in the countryside children are probably on the whole reasonably well controlled and i see no reason why weapons of this nature should not be used against small pest birds or small vermin <e> <s> the idea that anyone who had a wepaon like this would have to have a game licence and use it against anything more important in the animal kingdom is inconceivable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i had <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally support what has been said on this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to say to the noble lord lord beaumont that if this were to be strengthened as he would like and i sympathise with his desire to strengthen it there could be cases where a landowner a lady or a gentleman was in older years and not able to take as

british or foreign or a mixture of both <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i would just like to say so that we do not get it back again at third reading that a strengthened version might be very unfair to the owner concerned <e> <s> so far as the amendment goes i agree with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i am with him <e>", "<cs> my lords with my chief whip sitting in front of me i promise that i shall not go on for more than half a minute <e> <s> i should like it to be on the record that i think the amendment of my noble friend lord swansea is very sensible <e> <s> but in the light of what my noble friend lord avon has said perhaps we ought to leave it to the government to do this <e> <s> however i think that it would be a mistake for the government not to realise that this house is in

on this list <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the noble lords who put down this amendment on their success and the noble earl on the extreme sensibility and reasonableness with which he has accepted this <e> <s> like the noble lord lord melchett i too had pointed out to me in a letter from the association of sea fisheries committees that they would like to be consulted and i imagine from what the noble earl was saying about other interests that he will include those particular bodies <e> <s> i am glad to have his acknowledgment of that <e> <s> i should just like to express my extreme happiness at this stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord sandys for giving me such detailed chapter and verse which i should like to read and digest <e> <s> certainly in a moment or two i will withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i take it that i am correct in thinking that the general gist is provided the privileges envisaged in my amendment are not injurious to the particular nature reserve of that area the likelihood is that the privileges allowed by the owners will be allowed to go on <e> <s> am i right in thinking that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have seen the admirable result of what has happened on the lord chancellors wing which has received the admiration of people everywhere and is there not a danger in waiting for the secretary of states announcement

as the noble earl lord aldwyn has said <e> <s> i find the third paragraph rather conclusive about the present house like the house the roll is expensive to produce unwieldy to handle and difficult to consult <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that this problem has been going on for many years and despite the normal sympathy one would accord to wanting to help in a case such

able to distribute without government favour <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that president senghor of senegal used to say that after his mother country by adoption france he thought great britain was the greatest country in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is there a chance that this government which like the last government i would hasten to add also have such a good record in art
