["<cs> my lords the m motorway from gatwick to hooley in surrey was completed in <e> <s> following a joint study by officials of the departments of transport and of the environment the greater london council and surrey county council the last government announced in september that it had been decided not to proceed with the proposed extension of the m from hooley to mitcham <e> <s> a draft scheme and orders to revoke the <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a guarantee that there will be a reserved line <e> <s> when my right honourable friend makes his decision known the plan of what he is going to do will be the line for the future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have every sympathy with what the noble lord has said and i know it is a matter very close to his heart <e> <s> we do want to get on with thiswe do want to announce the line and proceed from there <e> <s> we are proceeding as fast as we can <e> <s> there are palliatives for people who are near the line <e> <s> it is not very satisfactory <e> <s> i agree that these delays do take place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> this is all part of the oint study which has been reported on <e> <s> we are now considering how best to remedy the matter and get the traffic flowing with the least possible worry and trouble to people who have housing interests <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend lord skelmersdale asked the leave of the house to withdraw his bill on st june i said that the government were willing to take cognizance of his proposed legislation <e> <s> regretfully our wildlife and countryside bill which would have taken account of his proposals has had to be postponed because of pressure on parliamentary time <e> <s> however it remains the governments intention to introduce that bill in its entirety as soon as parliamentary time permits <e> <s> we have no intention of introducing legislation to abolish hare coursing either in great britain or northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out to the noble lord that it is in no way this governments task to honour the last governments promises <e> <s> on the noble lords point about the working group on animal and bird conservation when published the governments bill will show that we have gone a long way towards meeting all the points that are necessary including the european community regulations <e> <s> on the noble lords point about legislation prohibiting hare coursing we are aware that there are groups and individuals in northern ireland who object to hare coursing but as the select committee pointed out to pass bills is not necessarily the best way to prevent cruelty <e> <s> the select committee suggested that a code of practice for hare coursing might be better <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a fair amount of experience of legislation over a number of years and although it is very easy to express sympathy for the hare it is exceedingly difficult to protect an animal which is the natural quarry of dogs <e> <s> i believe that to regulate coursing is probably an easier way out of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i am happy to tell the noble and learned lord that where the last government had good intentions we shall honour themwhere we think they had bad intentions we shall not honour them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to know that the noble lord had a good breakfast <e> <s> i thank him for his remarks with which i totally agree <e> <s> on his last question about a discussion document we shall produce our paper very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not particularly aware of what the noble lord has just said but i shall take note of it and pass it to my right honourable friends concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords happily that is not a question for me to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments concerned are aware of the environmental aspects of this problem on which there is already significant international co-operation <e> <s> we think that the strengthening of this cooperation to which the united kingdom is able to contribute much knowledge is the best way to make progress towards a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the rate was actually million hectares a year but with the approved and the illegal felling it could be that muchi do not know <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord that in that part of latin america there are some million hectares of tropical forest so there is still a large amount <e> <s> i think that we must accept that in that region there is an area which is exploitable but that there will always remain a large area which is unexploitable <e> <s> it is a problem and we are giving as much help and advice as we can to the relevant bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with a nations resources and we do not tell other countries how they should develop or exploit their own resources <e> <s> where there is a world scientific problem i take the view that the united nations is the correct body to deal with such matters <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> the contribution which the forests make to the worlds ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen is a very complicated subject <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords yesi appreciate the worries of the noble lord who has great scientific knowledge <e> <s> but our information is that the scientific evidence at present available does not make it a matter of immediate international concern <e> <s> we think that the short-term and local consequences of deforestation may well be more serious <e> <s> nevertheless the possible global and long-term climatic effects are sufficiently serious to warrant more scientific investigation <e> <s> we have had british technical co-operation officers serving in brazil and the governments out there are most happy to accept our advice on some of these matters because we have a great deal of experience in the tropical forests and our commonwealth forestry institute <e>", "<cs> my lords our intervention in the amazon is purely in aid of scientific help and as part of the united nations organisations <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware there is the food and agriculture organisation and the united nations environmental programme <e> <s> both that organisation and those taking part in that programme are pleased to use scientific advisers from all their member states <e> <s> that is the way we help <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> if all these forests were cut down there would indeed be serious implications for the natives who live in them <e> <s> but as i said there will always be large areas of non-exploitable forest <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the raising by my noble friend lord sandford of the important issues covered in the report of his sub-committee and of the report on farm structures which we are also debating <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him on having set afoot such a very good discussion as we have had especially with contributions from noble lords such as the noble lord lord peart who was one of the most popular ministers of agriculture this country has ever had and who has more knowledge than most of us <e>", "<cs> my lords the last time i went to the devon show the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh was crowning the dairy queen from new zealand so i have happy memories of it <e> <s> dealing again with the problems we are talking about at one end of the spectrum we have the more remote parts of the countryside notably in the uplands where there are few countervailing influences working to stem a steady trend of depopulation <e> <s> in england this is perhaps best exemplified by the north pennines which show ed a decline of more than per cent <e> <s> in population between and <e> <s> we shall of course have to await the results of the next census before any more up-to-date figures are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would agree with that completely <e> <s> so far i have dealt principally with the report of the noble lord lord sandford and his colleagues <e> <s> i want to conclude by making some comments on the report on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be speaking after my noble friend lord reigate has opened the batting today <e> <s> also i should like and i do not think that we have done so on this bill so far to acknowledge that i am very glad that the noble lord has been able to be here on committee and report because he was one of the first to be interested in this field <e> <s> i am very pleased although sometimes his knife gets sharp and my back is too close and i get frightened <e> <s> nevertheless i am happy to see the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel a small minnow in a large pool where all the whales are waiting to eat me <e> <s> i have to tell your lordships that we have taken very careful account of all that the noble lord lord reigate and others said during the committee stage <e> <s> i promised then that i would look at this amendment and i have done so <e> <s> we have been told today by the noble lord and others of a number of bodies whose members are appointed by the crown or by the prime minister rather than by the ministers functionally responsible <e> <s> these are all bodies which have been in existence for a considerable period of time <e> <s> i appreciate what my noble friend said about some of them having had their existence reconfirmed by later acts of parliament <e> <s> i do not deny that it used to be the practice for a very substantial number of these bodies to have their members appointed by the sovereign or the prime minister but it is not the practice nowadays and i feel bound to advise your lordships that in my view the present practice is the better one <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords have spoken and there has not been a single dissenting voice <e> <s> the most eminent people in your lordships house who are interested in the arts have all agreed with one another <e> <s> i should be very foolish to press my luck in the face of such wisdom <e> <s> i am quite sure that if we called a division now my noble friends would all seek advice from the members of the house sitting here and that the unanimous opinion would be that my position is wrong <e> <s> in the face of that i must not be like king canute <e> <s> i must advise the house that i will accept what they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and before the amendment is withdrawn i should not like the noble baroness to be under any illusion <e> <s> we are hoping to have a formal third reading and i should not like her to feel that i have misled her <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i give that firm categorical assurance and while i am speaking i failed previously to mention stonehenge <e> <s> that is of course already in national ownership and if such a thing occurred the trustees would be able to use their discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords the government must i fear resist these three amendments <e> <s> the purpose as the noble earl has said is to give the trustees discretion to acquire or accept gifts of property up to a certain value of the funds resources but at the same time to place a limit on the length of time the property may be retained <e> <s> as i made clear in committee we feel strongly that the trustees need not and should not have discretion in this particular matter and though we have carefully considered the point again we remain of that view for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> i must apologise because my answer will be slightly longer than i would have liked but it is very easy to make a generalisation in trying to improve a bill <e> <s> to give the full merits of the argument needs a few words occasionally <e>", "<cs> i must confess speaking off the cuff that i am not able to answer the noble lord on that point at this moment but i should have thought that the arguments i put forth were in their own right totally satisfactory to be quite honest <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again with the leave of the house because i am also now wishing to speak about my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity of reaffirming for the record what the governments policy is <e> <s> we obviously accept that an object can be pre-eminent <e>", "<cs> my lords my sympathies lie with the ex-minister for the arts rather than with the ex-secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> on the face of it the amendment as moved by the noble lord lord ross is an attractive one <e> <s> it would appear to enable us to satisfy both wings of the heritage movement by enabling us to pass to the trustees responsibility for accepting land in lieu of tax while retaining responsibility for acceptances ofworks of art and other items <e> <s> nevertheless the government must resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking off the cuff but i do not think it would be able to earn interest in the heritage fund until it is actually paid into that fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have had very strong advice from this house but it is not for me to advise my right honourable friends as to how they will see fit to implement this <e> <s> a little angel has just wafted me information <e> <s> i can tell the house that interest will be paid on the capital <e> <s> i take that to mean that it will be paid as from st april whether it is paid in or not <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have the leave of the house we are becoming a little unconstitutional tonight i think the answer is that one takes a risk in this matter if we are to have the bill on the statute book by about st april <e> <s> if noble lords are going to move amendments which will be heavily contested in another place then i should have thought that we were putting the bill at risk which i am sure is a fate which we all want to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me and i have no amendment <e> <s> but we have one slight problem <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> last night which was purely consequential and totally unimportant was omitted <e> <s> it is not shown in <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the sincerity with which the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord <e> <s> lord winstanley have spoken to this amendment and let me assure them that i fully appreciate the argument which they are putting forward <e> <s> we have no wish to look around for some man who is so rich that he does not need to have any other succour <e> <s> as your lordships are aware we are providing the normal expenses for travelling and so on which will be necessary for the job to be done <e> <s> but once the first few weeks or months are over we do not expect this to be anything approaching a full-time job <e> <s> the chairman and the trustees will have a full-time secretariat not big but efficient which will do the job <e> <s> they will be approached by peopleit is not a job where they will have to think about what they are going <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down i must say that i never said that we were looking for someone who was so rich that he could not do the job <e> <s> we are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is out of order <e>"]
