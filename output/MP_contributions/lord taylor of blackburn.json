["<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister aware that in one particular factory in lancashire at oswaldtwistle near blackburn where they employ roughly employees it is a question not just of the employees being made redundant but of the spin-off in the whole area <e> <s> therefore may i ask the minister what steps the government are taking about that <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to come in at this particular stage but i think it is right and proper that i should do so <e> <s> i have spent over two years on the taylor report and have made recommendations to governors on this particular question <e> <s> i have visited authorities throughout the united kingdom and i have listened to governors and managers <e> <s> one of the things our committee found was that primary managers wanted parity of esteem with secondary schools <e> <s> i am sorry that the government have not seen fit to do this <e> <s> i am glad that there are certain amendments on which i shall speak as the debate continues in the course of the next few days but certain things are completely wrong therefore i will support the <e>", "<cs> it did <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend on this matter <e> <s> my noble friend comes from an area that was formerly pembrokeshire where the seat of government is about miles away from one particular part of the county <e> <s> therefore there is remoteness and so it is more important <e>", "<cs> may i support the amendment <e> <s> i serve on an electricity board as a part-time member <e> <s> there are two full-time members and six part-time members <e> <s> we feel as part-time members that we are second-class citizens <e> <s> this is completely wrong because we make the same decisions as do the two full-time members <e> <s> the same applies to schools <e> <s> again people find that the foundation governors feel that they are more part of the school than anyone else <e> <s> i am sure that the right reverend prelates would agree with the words in st pauls letter to the romans <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord lord vaizey on this point because it is important <e> <s> warnock makes a similar recommendation to this <e> <s> it is important that we carry the special schools with us because the special schools do not want to be any different from the rest of the schools <e> <s> they want to be part and parcel <e> <s> they do not want any special treatment at all but they want to be looked upon as being part of the overall system of education in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> but surely there have been consultations between the warnock committee and the voluntary bodies on the subject <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may come in on this point <e> <s> i apologise for having to leave the chamber for a few moments <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> this is absolutely stupid <e> <s> i came up as did the noble lord by becoming the chairman of the education committee and then the leader of the local authority <e> <s> i do not know whether that is the line of thought which goes on in local authorities but this is what happened <e> <s> as chairman of the education committee i found myself as the chairman of governors or managers of schools which was absolutely ridiculous because one could not pay due respect to the work done in the schools <e> <s> when therefore we looked into the government and management of schools we looked very closely at this point and came to the conclusion that it was wrong for anybody to be a governor of more than three schools <e> <s> we thought it was right and proper that it should be three schools <e> <s> may i support the noble baroness lady david on this <e> <s> we felt also that they should not just be members of the local education authority but should be people with a wide interest right across the board who would support the local education authority <e> <s> we felt that they should be there because county councillors and district councillors cannot do everything <e>", "<cs> oh no <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear to my former friend the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill what we recommended <e> <s> it is quite clear that he is wrong on this one about the election because what we said is this there are the elected representatives from the local authority there are the representatives elected by the parent body there are the representatives elected by the teachers and the staff of the school <e> <s> that is three bodies out of the four are elected <e> <s> representatives of the community are difficult to elect because one wants to bring in people who are interested in that community <e> <s> what is good for yorkshire may not be good for lancashire <e>", "<cs> may i make my position clear on this <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot support my noble friend on this amendment and therefore i will not go into the division lobby with him neither will i support the government <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend on this question <e> <s> it is vital that you get people who represent the community on governing bodies <e> <s> for example if you take lancashire you get certain areas where you have the industrial community and if you get a good industrialist on there then it is worth while because you get the connection with the industry in that area <e> <s> if you are in a rural area where you have a strong agricultural connection then you bring someone in from the agricultural community <e> <s> these people can pass on advice to the staff of the schools for which the staff are crying out <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i was out of the chamber at the beginning of this debate but as the noble minister has quoted my committee on this may i tell him and the committee that the situation was that my committee was very much divided about this matter <e> <s> they had mixed views and reservations about whether there should or should not be such representation <e> <s> therefore being a very good democrat and being the chairman of the committee i asked them to express a majority vote and they expressed a majority vote in the way that the recommendation indicates <e> <s> nevertheless i feel that the amendment which is laid before your lordships and i hope the minister will accept this because i think it is something which should be gone into very carefully will certainly help us a great deal if the minister will accept it <e>", "<cs> i do not want to repeat again everything that i said earlier in the debate but i want to emphasise what the noble baroness lady seear has said <e> <s> in going round the country and visiting many schools and listening to many people in the teaching profession i find that they are crying out for this <e> <s> they themselves wish this to happen <e> <s> they wish to know what is going on <e> <s> they want to get involved because they find that they are completely at a loss as to what is going on in industry using lady seears definition for industry <e> <s> they wish to know all this <e>", "<cs> may i point out to my noble friend lord james of rusholme that i being a lancastrian and knowing manchester grammar school very well recall that when the noble lord lord james was high master of the school he did quite a number of good things in courting industry and bringing industrialists on to his governing body through his chairman <e> <s> he did exactly the same at york <e> <s> i have for many years followed the way in which he has worked and he has done a jolly good job in tackling the matter this way <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord vaizey on this amendment <e> <s> i was chairman of a special school for many years <e> <s> i found it most advantageous to the rest of the managers of that particular school to have people who were actually disabled had been disabled or had been part of the community of that school on the governing body <e> <s> they assisted us greatly <e> <s> they gave us a lot of knowledge and know-how of what went on in the school what disabilities there were and it was very good for us <e> <s> i am sure that this amendment is the right one because it will greatly improve the efficiency and the running of a school <e>", "<cs> may i remind the minister that none of the teacher associations is in favour of grouping <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give the committee the benefit of the experience i had during the deliberations of the taylor committee <e> <s> we spent much time discussing this matter visiting schools and discussing it with students and we got a very mixed reception <e> <s> there were sixth form pupils who felt it would be a good thing for them to be on governing bodies while others thought it would not be a good idea and they felt that the best method would be for them to work through schools councils and be observers at governors meetings rather than be participants and full members of governing bodies <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady masham of ilton said there were a number of young people who were very mixed up at the age of <e> <s> i say with respect to my colleagues on that committee that i found that they too were very mixed up on this one <e> <s> however in true british style we decided to compromise <e> <s> we compromised by saying that when the government of the day reduced the age of majority from to at that time they should be members of governing bodies but not until then and that until that time they should be just observers <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> i think that this is important <e> <s> this is taking place where there are members of staff on governing bodies and where there are already parents on governing bodies <e> <s> the experience that we have gathered over the time is that it is important that people should explain where they stand where they are and so on <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> surely even in leeds this would not take place <e> <s> it would work out much differently because in grouping quite a large number one might not get the right kind <e>", "<cs> did i understand the noble baroness lady young correctly that it is her intention that each school will eventually have its own governing body <e>", "<cs> may i remind the minister that years ago and i am sorry that lord alexander is not in the chamber at this particular time it was the wish of the department that there should be consultation with the association of education committees as they were at that particular time and that that was written into quite a number of statutes <e> <s> this was often the case <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord alexander is not here to support me <e> <s> this was common practice <e>", "<cs> i am not withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because it is one about which i feel strongly <e> <s> when one becomes a member of this house one receives a handbook giving instructions as to what goes on and so forthand i think that is very important <e> <s> when one becomes a governor of a school very often in many authorities one does know what ones position is <e> <s> it was interesting to me in going round the country to note how many governors and managers did <e>", "<cs> will the minister agree that this point also comes under subsection <e>", "<cs> i believe that subsection <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount whether this is the unanimous view of the county councils association <e>", "<cs> we are pleased to have the contribution of <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is a good amendment and i am very grateful that the minister has decided to take it in this way because i think that it is very important for it to be taken in this way <e> <s> being a very young grandfather and knowing what goes on i think it is first-class that the minister has decided to do this <e>"]
