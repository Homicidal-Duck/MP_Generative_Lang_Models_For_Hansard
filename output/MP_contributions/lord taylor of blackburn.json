is the noble viscount the minister aware that in one particular factory in lancashire at oswaldtwistle near blackburn where they employ roughly employees it is a question not just of the employees being made redundant but of the spin-off in the whole area <e> <s> therefore may i ask the minister what steps the government are taking about that <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to come in at this particular stage but i think it is right and proper that i should do so <e> <s> i have spent over two years on the taylor report and have made recommendations to governors on this particular question <e> <s> i have visited authorities throughout the united kingdom and i have listened to governors and managers <e> <s> one of the things our committee found was that primary managers wanted parity of esteem with secondary schools <e> <s> i am sorry that the government have not seen fit to do this <e> <s> i am glad that there are certain amendments on which i shall speak as the debate continues in the course of the next few days but certain things are completely wrong therefore i will support the <e>", "<cs> it did <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend on this matter <e> <s> my noble friend

important <e>", "<cs> may i support the amendment <e> <s> i serve on an electricity board as a part-time member <e> <s> there are two full-time members and six part-time members <e> <s> we feel as part-time members that we are second-class citizens <e> <s> this is completely wrong because we make the same decisions as do the two full-time members <e> <s> the same applies to schools <e> <s> again people find that the foundation governors feel that they are more part of the school than anyone else <e> <s> i am sure that the right reverend prelates would agree with the words in st pauls letter to the romans <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord lord vaizey on this point because it is important <e> <s> warnock makes a similar recommendation to this <e> <s> it is important that we carry the special schools with us because the special schools do not want to be any different from the rest of the schools <e> <s> they want to be part and parcel <e> <s> they do not want any special treatment at all but they want to be looked upon as being part of the overall system of education in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> but surely there have been consultations between the warnock committee and the voluntary bodies on the subject <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may come in on this point <e> <s> i apologise for having to leave the chamber for a few moments <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> this is absolutely stupid <e> <s> i came up as did the noble lord by becoming the chairman of the education committee and then the leader of the local authority <e> <s> i do not know whether that is the line of thought which goes on in local authorities but this is what happened <e> <s> as chairman of the education committee i found myself as the chairman of governors or managers of schools which was absolutely ridiculous because one could not pay due respect to the work done in the schools <e> <s> when therefore we looked into the government and management of schools we looked very closely at this point and came to the conclusion that it was wrong for anybody to be a governor of more than three schools <e> <s> we thought it was right and proper that it should be three schools <e> <s> may i support the noble baroness lady david on this <e> <s> we felt also that they should not just be members of the local education authority but should be people with a wide interest right across the board who would support the local education authority <e> <s> we felt that they should be there because county councillors and district councillors cannot do everything <e>", "<cs> oh no <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear to my former friend the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill what we recommended <e> <s> it is quite clear that he is wrong on this one about the election because what we said is this there are the elected representatives from the local authority there are the representatives elected by the parent body there are the representatives elected by the teachers and the staff of the school <e> <s> that is three bodies out of the four are elected <e> <s> representatives of the community are difficult to elect because one wants to bring in people who are interested in that community <e> <s> what is good for yorkshire may not be good for lancashire <e>", "<cs> may i make my position clear on this <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot support my noble friend on this amendment and therefore i will not go into the division lobby with him neither will i support the government <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend on this question <e> <s> it is vital that you get people who represent the community on governing bodies <e> <s> for example if you take lancashire you get certain areas where you have the industrial community and if you get a good industrialist on there then it is worth while because you get the connection with the industry in that area <e> <s> if you are in a rural area where you have a strong agricultural connection then you bring someone in from the agricultural community <e> <s> these people can pass on advice to the staff of the schools for which the staff are crying out <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i was out of the chamber at the beginning of this debate but as the noble minister has quoted my committee on this may i tell him and the committee that the situation was that my committee was very much divided about this matter <e> <s> they had mixed views and reservations about whether there should or should not be such representation <e> <s> therefore being a very good democrat and being the chairman of the committee i asked them to express a majority vote and they expressed a majority vote in the way that the recommendation indicates <e> <s> nevertheless i feel that the amendment which is laid before your lordships and i hope the minister will accept this because i think it is something which should be gone into very carefully will certainly help us a great deal if the minister will accept it <e>", "<cs> i do not want to repeat again everything that i said earlier in the debate but i want to emphasise what the noble baroness lady seear has said <e> <s> in going round the country and visiting many schools and listening to many people in the teaching profession i find that they are crying out for this <e> <s> they themselves wish this to happen <e> <s> they wish to know what is going on <e> <s> they want to get involved because they find that they are completely at a loss as to what is going on in industry using lady seears definition for industry <e> <s> they wish to know all this <e>", "<cs> may i point out to my noble friend lord james of rusholme that i being a lancastrian and knowing manchester grammar school very well recall that when the noble lord lord james was high master of the school he did quite a number of good things in courting industry and bringing industrialists on to his governing body through his chairman <e> <s> he did exactly the same at york <e> <s> i have for many years followed the way in which he has worked and he has done a jolly good job in tackling the matter this way <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord vaizey on this amendment <e> <s> i was chairman of a special school for many years <e> <s> i found it most advantageous to the rest of the managers of that particular school to have people who were actually disabled had been disabled or had been part of the community of that school on the governing body <e> <s> they assisted us greatly <e> <s> they gave us a lot of knowledge and know-how of what went on in the school what disabilities there were and it was very good for us <e> <s> i am sure that this amendment is the right one because it will greatly improve the efficiency and the running of a school <e>", "<cs> may i remind the minister that none of the teacher associations is in favour of grouping <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give the committee the benefit of the experience i had during the deliberations of the taylor committee <e> <s> we spent much time discussing this matter visiting schools and discussing it with students and we got a very mixed reception <e> <s> there were sixth form pupils who felt it would be a good thing for them to be on governing bodies while others thought it would not be a good idea and they felt that the best method would be for them to work through schools councils and be observers at governors meetings rather than be participants and full members of governing bodies <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady masham of ilton said there were a number of young people who were very mixed up at the age of <e> <s> i say with respect to my colleagues on that committee that i found that they too were very mixed up on this one <e> <s> however in true british style we decided to compromise <e> <s> we compromised by saying that when the government of the day reduced the age of majority from to at that time they should be members of governing bodies but not until then and that until that time they should be just observers <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> i think that this is important <e> <s> this is taking place where there are members of staff on governing bodies and where there are already parents on governing bodies <e> <s> the experience that we have gathered over the time is that it is important that people should explain where they stand where they are and so on <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> surely even in leeds this would not take place <e> <s> it would work out much differently because in grouping quite a large number one might not get the right kind <e>", "<cs> did i understand the noble baroness lady young correctly that it is her intention that each school will eventually have its own governing body <e>", "<cs> may i remind the minister that years ago and i am sorry that lord alexander is not in the chamber at this particular time it was the wish of the department that there should be consultation with the association of education committees as they were at that particular time and that that was written into quite a number of statutes <e> <s> this was often the case <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord alexander is not here to support me <e> <s> this was common practice <e>", "<cs> i am not withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because it is one about which i feel strongly <e> <s> when one becomes a member of this house one receives a handbook giving instructions as to what goes on and so forthand i think that is very important <e> <s> when one becomes a governor of a school very often in many authorities one does know what ones position is <e> <s> it was interesting to me in going round the country to note how many governors and managers did <e>", "<cs> will the minister agree that this point also comes under subsection <e>", "<cs> i believe that subsection <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount whether this is the unanimous view of the county councils association <e>", "<cs> we are pleased to have the contribution of <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is a good amendment and i am very grateful that the minister has decided to take it in this way because i think that it is very important for it to be taken in this way <e> <s> being a very young grandfather and knowing what goes on i think it is first-class that the minister has decided to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the governments policy because it is creating unemployment encourages people to go into the forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i am getting a little tired of the minister just referring tothe association of county councils <e> <s> there are other associations that have entirely different views from those of the association of county councils <e> <s> also may i say that there are authorities in this country not just <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the figures that he has given to the house take into calculation those houses that have been allocated to our nato allies <e> <s> for example in pembrokeshire or dyfed i know of quite a number of houses that have been allocated to american forces there hut they have not been taken up and have been lying empty for quite some time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the noble lord lord vaizey very strongly <e> <s> i always have in mind the case that we had years ago in lancashire with kathleen ferrier who applied for a scholarship and did not get one simply because of the reasons lord vaizey has stated today <e> <s> i think this amendment is very important indeed and we should go all the way to support the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the answer to this question but may i ask that when we receive the report we should have ample time to discuss and realise what the report is really saying rather than be presented with a <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the statement by the foreign secretary on this situation and in view of the consensus of agreement on all sides of the house i feel that we should be foolish in continuing this discussion because the situation is so fluid at the moment and is moving day by day and hour by hour <e> <s> i feel that we should leave it like that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what has gone on i think we would be stupid to go on discussing this <e> <s> i intervened yesterday in another debate and the foreign secretary said certain things about my intervention but i think it would be stupid for us to carry on in this way <e> <s> i think we should leave it with the people who are discussing it at the present time rather than go on in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the external services of the bbc are strongly favourable to british business interests in creating a climate which is helpful to british exporters <e> <s> will he use his best efforts to prevent the extremist monetarists in his own party from damaging british interests in pursuing that party dogma <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise on this occasion to support completely the noble lord lord vaizey because i totally agree with the propositions that he has put forward <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise on three counts <e> <s> may i first apologise to the noble viscount lord chandos for butting in when i did earlier <e> <s> i do apologise most sincerely to him for that <e> <s> i also

down on the list of speakers and to my colleagues on this bench that for the first time i have stepped down here to make a speech <e> <s> so i have done the four apologies in one and f your lordships all accept my apologies that is it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the minister is not aware of what is going on among local authorities in regard to cut-backs and the cut-backs are on this side <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as somebody who was born in i hope we are not going to dance the hornpipe in here tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister

comprehensive education that we did not bulldoze comprehensive education through the country <e> <s> it was taken up entirely with the local authorities and they decided themselves <e> <s> we did not

other place whether this organisation is registered as a charity <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the objection should be in writing <e> <s> if somebody does not object in writing what is the position then <e>", "<cs> i was going to make exactly the same point as my noble friend lord pitt that it is the situation as has been stated from the government front bench on more than one occasion

here <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers statement that it will take months before we receive a report from the committee would he not be willing to give us an interim report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether <e>", "<cs> my lords may we have an undertaking that the minister will report back to us about what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said where there is difficulty in the textile areas of lancashire and yorkshire will he be prepared to talk to his colleagues with a view to reintroducing development area status or assisted area status where it is at present withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not be willing to extend the scheme still further <e>", "<cs> my

coming together to which my noble friend also referred <e> <s> in this bill we are trying to work more closely together and i hope the noble baroness lady young when she replies will see that there is

salford university attracted a tremendous amount of public money and yet were cut by the ugc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to take part in this debate today and also to pay my compliment to my noble friend lord glenamara for initiating this debate because i reckon that he was one of the first secretaries of state who got local authorities and people concerned in education really thinking about the future of education <e> <s> i am grateful to be able to take part because of what my noble friend has done and i pay him my compliment publicly for what he initiated while he was secretary of state at the department <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider setting up some kind of consultancy agency to co-ordinate all the activities that are going on <e> <s> it is all very well for the minister to say that there is an advertising agency that is doing the work for him but just look at the papers in my hand <e> <s> these are from the advertising agency with all the information

curriculum the minister must be aware that the curriculum is the responsibility of the governors of the school <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister gives the information for which he has been asked will he break it down into sexes as to the number of boys and girls going to these centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened intently to what speakers from each side of the house have had to say

expenditure incurred by the royal navy in going out there to recover these mines <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the frustration felt by many companies in the united kingdom compared with companies in europe at the delay before they are informed whether they will be allowed to export items out of this country <e> <s> the average processing time when a british company applies to

years and we come from all parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> we have quite a lot to contribute to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a further plea repeating what has been said earlier that there should be the widest possible consultation before anything is done to student grants again and that a green paper or a white paper should be issued so that many people can bring forward their views as to how things should go in the future <e> <s> the government should not spring it on people as has been done during the last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him in view of the adverse comments that have been made on the green paper whether he will be prepared to recommend to his right honourable friend the secretary of state the findings of the committee which i had the privilege of chairing some time ago and their implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the chairman of committees and perhaps i am using this opportunity to inquire of the government chief whip and the opposition chief whip to state what criteria will be chosen tomorrow for people participating in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him to do everything that he possibly can to expediate <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords expediate it and to get the report out as quickly as possible because there are so many local authorities waiting to know exactly where we go <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the cost mentioned represents the cost of new hospitals and large comprehensive schools in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the minister would not write only to my noble friend lord ross but would publish this in the library so that we all know about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister watch panorama this evening which will inform him of the figures he is now seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords once this dispute is settled would not the time be right to scrap burnham completely and start with new negotiating machinery <e> <s> i am sure that is long overdue <e> <s> burnham is completely out of date and is not satisfactory to anyone at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the majority of the members of this house agree that the parole board is doing a jolly good job <e> <s> is it the intention that because of one mistake we should scrap or try to scrap the parole board as it exists at present <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say i am very pleased that this report has been published at last because i have been one of those who have been pressing for quite some time for it to be published <e> <s> but my word when we get a report such as this costing -odd and ask the ethnic minorities to read it and participate in its findings this is just crazy <e> <s> i am very glad that there is also a brief report as well <e> <s> i am sure that will be read but as for the main one costing it is impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble earl is not aware that he has not answered the question of my noble friend lord taylor of mansfield <e> <s> my noble friend asked whether the minister is aware that the charges are not distributed throughout the industry but are charged against each particular pit which makes that pit uneconomic <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has read out a statement which was made in another place <e> <s> as he has probably gathered from the questions and the interest from all sides of the house many of us are not satisfied with the way in which this matter has been conducted <e> <s> i am glad that the leader of the house is present because a number of us intend giving notice that we want a full debate and we shall do this in the appropriate way <e> <s> we cannot debate the matter fully today and we cannot get the answers we want today <e> <s> the minister quite rightly cannot answer our questions so the only way we can satisfy ourselves on the matter is to seek a debate in the appropriate way and we shall do that

"<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for his very full reply to the question and may i also congratulate him on a very successful mission <e> <s> because all the information i have received since

that i welcome the statement so far as it goes <e> <s> the only part of the white paper that i have read i have read it so i know what i am speaking about is paragraph to which i referred when the noble earl the minister made his comments on the proposal about governing bodies <e> <s> i am glad that his right honourable friend has withdrawn most of the things that he advocated in the green paper <e> <s> i am glad too that after seven years of pioneering along with many other people he has accepted the formula that my committee laid down or near enough to it at that time <e> <s> i am grateful for that <e> <s> i hope and look forward to early legislation on the governing bodies of schools and the powers of schools <e> <s> i do not believe that i need say more at this stage <e> <s>

published in this mornings <e>", "<cs> my lords after listening to the statement which the minister has made may i say that this is a very sad day indeed for higher education in this country <e> <s> many of us who have worked so hard feel very sad after listening to that statement <e> <s> the question that i should like to put to the noble baroness is does this confirm something that many of us have been thinking for some time that the ugc is now an instrument of government rather than an independent body <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while she may be satisfied the department may be satisfied and the government may be satisfied there are many patients who are not satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out that there is a difference between liverpool city council and the mcc in the liverpool area <e> <s> the noble lord is at cross purposes between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply to my question <e> <s> i am not privileged to attend the annual conference of the building societies association and i look forward to reading the report which is placed in the library <e> <s> perhaps i may ask whether this includes conveyancing and whether the government intend allowing building societies to introduce conveyancing for their

service have as i have wives who work in the citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> my wife is constantly coming to me and telling me what is going on there and telling me about case after case of people who are not getting the benefits and asking to be moved on from one place to another <e> <s> there is only one thing for it <e> <s> it is for this act to be completely repealed <e> <s> it is causing more hardship than anything i have known for many years <e> <s> therefore i sincerely hope that the minister and the officials will realise how difficult it is for those who are working in the field to explain to people what are their entitlements <e> <s> i hope that something is done very quickly <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness has said that the minister will look at it again and again <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take note of the numerous complaints that are coming from all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for education <e> <s> i should have thought that this would be a matter for the department of trade and industry rather than for the department of education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that the co-operative bank is offering the same facility <e>", "<cs> my lords in accepting what the noble lord the chairman of committees has said i think that it is only fair that a genuine backbencher because so far everyone who has spoken has either been a privy counsellor or a front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us accept that we should work through the usual channels but when else can we object except when the business statement is first made <e>", "<cs> that is not true my lords <e>", "<cs> what about tyne and wear my lords <e>", "<cs> answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at this point ask <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite all right <e> <s> actually i was trying to ask the leader of the house if there is any way in which we can say thank you to servants of the house who are retiring <e> <s> i know that this will create a precedent but i would be grateful if the noble viscount would consider it <e> <s> many of us learnt this week that the head doorkeeper is retiring after many years of service to the house <e> <s> many of us i believe would like to say thank you for his services and wish him well in his retirement <e> <s> very often there are others whose retirement we do not know about until they have left the house of lords <e> <s> is there some way in which we can officially say thank you for their services <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he say whether when experiments and innovations have occurred if it is necessary to standardise the release mechanism at a later stage it will be possible to introduce legislation at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that in view of the amount of money that is being spent by the soviet union on research and development in this and other fields he should have a word with his colleague the secretary of state for education and science to spend more money in this country on research and development in all fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord irving of dartford for initiating this short debate on the problems facing the nations schools <e> <s> i come from a region which in the past could boast of its schools its standards and the progress which had been made in all the different branches of education <e> <s> the north-west in general and lancashire in particular were the forerunners of the industrial revolution which gave so much to make britain great <e> <s> side by side with all the achievements in industry went the development of our education and schools which took the form of a partnership between government the local authority and the churches <e> <s> the north-west is perhaps different from many other regions in the country because around per cent <e> <s> of the schools are church schools of one kind or another aided voluntary aided or controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how many british firms have been assisted in the way of soft loans in doing trade with china <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that all the time it has been a case of the local authorities having to give give and give without support from the des <e> <s> surely this is wrong <e> <s> surely at this point where the unions and the local authorities have gone so far the department itself should back up the local authorities in releasing monies for this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that since his government came to office one-third of the trained engineers in the north-west have not been replaced <e> <s> what will be the result when this recession ends <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the great interest in this matter especially in the barrow area where if my memory serves me aright a quarter of the population are employed there <e> <s> if there is any chance of their participating in the buying of this firm they are very much interested <e>", "<cs> my lords does this apply to authorities that have declared themselves nuclear-free zones <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady stedman for taking us on a tour of the dales <e> <s> it has been a very nice occasion listening to her going along there <e> <s> i think it could be bettered a little only perhaps by brian redhead who lives in the area or russell harty who also lives there <e> <s> both those personalities could do this tour for us and probably get it over to more people than we can this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall argue the point with my noble friend on some other occasion <e> <s> i ask only that we should try to get the matter in order <e> <s> i know that the financial argument is that we cannot retain the railway but there is far more to a railway than finance <e> <s> please let us keep the line open <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the prospectus that was sent out yesterday by the management/workers participation consortium <e> <s> if he is so aware will he congratulate the consortium on their initiative in getting such a prospectus out so quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl and my noble friend lord mcintosh for the tributes which they paid to the work of my committee <e> <s> i say my committee but i was only there to look after them the members of the committee did the work <e> <s> therefore i am grateful for the tributes which have been paid to them <e> <s> but i also find it very sad on this day that looking across the chamber there is not one right reverend prelate in the chamber to listen to this debate <e> <s> it is very sad when one remembers that the church has said so much about education over the years that it does not have any representative here this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that as the bill proceeds through its various stages the church will have representatives in the chamber <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and look forward to its implementation as a new enlightenment to the bill <e> <s> the one point that i should like to make to the committee this afternoon is that we should remember that we are not dealing just with the ilea <e> <s> the educational system does not comprise of ilea alone <e> <s> there are local education authorities in england and wales <e> <s> our minds must be spread throughout the countrys educational system <e> <s> if we do that from the very beginning and do not think just of the ilea we shall get off to the right start <e>", "<cs> i did not mean to speak at this stage in committee and intended to wait until later <e> <s> but i am getting worried about the way in which the committee is going <e> <s> we seem to be introducing a lot of subjects which should not be brought in now <e> <s> i must now repeat quite a lot of what i said at second reading and then go on to one or two other matters on which various noble lords have raised questions during the discussion on this clause <e> <s> i shall try not to speak with the feeling that has been brought out in me by some of the things that have been said <e>", "<cs> i should like to contribute to the debate because my name is attached to the amendment but i was not certain about the way in which we were to deal with the grouping and hence i did not speak in the early stage <e> <s> what has been said about co-opted governors is true <e> <s> however i say to the noble lord lord renton that he should beware of co-opted governors as they stand at present <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has had experience of special schools but he needs to have experience of other schools as well because he will find that a great many co-opted governors are political governors disguised under all kinds of names <e> <s> we must be very careful about this <e> <s> with a change at county hall or a change of local authority the co-opted governors will change as well <e> <s> the amendment does away with some of those people and brings back into the government of the school those people who really can contribute to it <e>", "<cs> i hope that they are active members of their appropriate trade union <e> <s> i hope that all members of a trade union are active and supportive members <e> <s> we should not be in half the trouble that we are in at present if most of them were active <e>", "<cs> may i go back a little way in what the noble baroness said <e> <s> when the taylor committee was set up our terms of reference were made clear <e> <s> we were concerned with county schools and not with the dual system <e> <s> when the statement was first made in the other place saying that the committee was going to be formed and so on it was very wide but a few weeks afterwards i received a letter from the then secretary of state informing us not to concern ourselves with the dual system even though there were two representatives of the anglican church and the roman catholic church on the committee <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> we are now producing a more articulate and inquisitive society than ever before in which young people are anxious to find out as much as they can <e> <s> they are more anxious to challenge their elders as to why they arrive at certain decisions <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl said and my concern for his tummy i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down let me say that from the lancashire authority co-operation on the lines that he has just indicated is now taking place <e>", "<cs> i disagree entirely with the noble baroness on this <e> <s> in my experience since the act was introduced it has not worked even where you have two schools on one site co-operating together <e> <s> at this time in the evening i have no intention of entering into a long debate but i give notice of my intention of putting down an amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while being grateful for the answer that the minister has given to the house i should also be very grateful if he could speed up the process still further <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there are a number of cases that have been going on for some time <e> <s> i am sure it gives the minister concern as well as all members of this house <e>", "<cs> may i remind the committee of what i said earlier <e> <s> there are local education authorities in england and wales and it is wrong for the noble lord to quote just one education authority in the way in which he has <e> <s> is the noble lord implying that all the education authorities are being issued with propaganda of that sort <e> <s> it is not so at all <e>", "<cs> what we are forgetting is that if this bill is enacted with one or two improving amendments we shall be dealing with a different situation <e> <s> this is what we have to remember <e> <s> it will be a different situation with different people there who will have a greater say <e> <s> the government are trying to say to us look we are trying systems that have been proved <e> <s> we are going to improve the governing bodies of schools which will have a greater say in the administration and in the running of the schools so let them have a go <e> <s> let them have a say <e> <s> let the people who really matter have a say <e> <s> this is all that the government are saying <e> <s> therefore i support what they are saying on this issue <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i am not happy about withdrawing this but of course i have to at this stage <e> <s> i was not looking at the cost because in most schools there will be very little cost involved in the annual meetings <e> <s> there might be some cost involved for one or two in doing it this way <e> <s> we were trying to be helpful and to provide this freedom <e> <s> i am quite sincere in saying that <e> <s> if one is talking about freedom of this kind please give schools the opportunity to carry it out in this way <e>", "<cs> i presume there have been consultations with the teachers associations on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment on the grounds that it is worthwhile because of the additional work that will be placed on many schools especially small ones where usually the clerk is either the parish priest or someone in a similar capacity <e> <s> they are asked these days to carry out an enormous number of tasks <e> <s> it is therefore worthwhile that we should encourage local authorities along with the government to agree to what is contained within the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to address your lordships on this second reading with some trepidation because this is something that i know little about <e> <s> i have never spoken before in any way at all on airports navigation or aviation <e> <s> therefore i am completely at a loss when i hear the noble baroness speaking about the great london airports and even manchester airport <e> <s> i know very little about them except as a user <e> <s> but i know something about the region in which i live and the region in which i work and have interests in <e> <s> that is the lancashire area <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer the noble lord the minister referred to improvement grants <e> <s> i admit that over the years with government aid not just from this government but also from previous governments local authorities have assisted in that way but many people slip through the net because they are not in one of the areas involved <e> <s> it is most difficult for such people to receive any help <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the shortage of skilled engineers and draughtsmen particularly in lancashire <e> <s> what proportion of the money is being allocated for training such people <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this clause <e> <s> i think that it is one which is necessary and which very much needs inclusion in the bill <e> <s> the reason i support it is that some time ago when i was going round looking at governing bodies i realised that many of them were unaware of what were their rights as governors and because of their unawareness all kinds of decisions were taken that should not have been taken decisions which had to be corrected by the local education officers <e>", "<cs> as if he could think that <e>", "<cs> i too very strongly support this new clause but i should like to have a definition of the word staff <e> <s> is the noble baroness referring just to the teaching staff or is she referring also to such people as a good caretaker who probably is there much longer than other members of the staff a school secretary who again may be there much longer or a groundsman in the case of an accident in the school grounds <e> <s> if the noble baroness intends the new clause to cover a wide conception of staff in that way <e> <s> i support it completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady seear for initiating this debate this afternoon at what i feel is one of the most useful times given to members of your lordships house for expressing their concern about education <e> <s> of course the education bill is passing through the house and a number of noble lords have given their opinions about certain aspects of it but this debate allows us to stray in other directions also <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord kirkwood on his maiden speech <e> <s> long may he continue to grace your lordships house and long may he continue to come forward with ideas such as those which he has spoken about this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure we all welcome his participation in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not mentioning the opposition party and i am not being droll either <e> <s> i have been involved in education for almost years in one form or another <e> <s> as many previous speakers have said morale among those in education is as low as it possibly can be in all fields from teachers in primary schools to university vice-chancellors <e>

to his right honourable friend and ask him whether he would now be prepared to postpone the sitting of the gce examination rather than rush it through at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take note of my noble friends question <e> <s> if teachers are to be assessed will it be a good mark in their career structure if they have done overseas voluntary service or similar work <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to deal not with the numbers but with the proportion <e> <s> the thinking behind the idea was the four equal <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not now a fact after listening to the statement that no longer is the ugc an independent body but a branch of the department of education and science <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the minister aware of the oustanding work

there are for pupils to enter into an engineering career <e> <s> if she is so aware what help is she giving to the council <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the statement about the opening of nine new railway stations may i ask the minister how many of these have been paid for by british money and how many by european money <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from these benches to say that i am not happy about this bill <e> <s> when it was first published and when the white papers were published earlier i welcomed them <e> <s> in the beginning i welcomed the bill to some extent and said that it needed improving <e> <s> during the passage of the bill i have sat in the chamber right from the beginning to the end and have listened to everything that has been said from all sides <e> <s> therefore i can speak from the position of having listened and of having spoken from time to time but only when i thought it was wise to do so <e> <s> i do so now because i feel that we on the back-benches have been let down to some extent <e> <s> a lot of the things that we were proposing were not political but were there to try and improve the bill <e> <s> we have improved it a little but by no means as much as i would like <e> <s> nevertheless i know that the bill is now going to another place and i hope that the members there will take up where we have left off and improve it still more before it is enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords the majority of people in this country were not interested in the post code when it first came out <e> <s> the majority of people could not care less about it <e> <s> it was therefore the responsibility of the post office to make a deal with british telecom <e> <s> may i ask the minister and this is what we are trying to get at whether the government will please use their good offices to get both parties together so that it will be of benefit to everyone in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister kindly ask general practitioner committees to make doctors aware of this problem <e> <s> i do not think that she has answered the noble baronesss question which was whether she would make general practitioners aware of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the minister aware that many general practitioners do not take farming papers and that therefore the department should make general practitioners aware of this matter <e> <s> it should not be done through the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food or anyone else like that <e> <s> it is the departments responsibility to make general practitioners aware of this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that over the past few years few schools have been able to extend their libraries due to the cuts in capitation allowances and in the main libraries have been extended only through the contributions of parents <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he is speaking about books in general and text books in particular but not library books and there is a difference <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is not the same authority to which the letter originally went <e> <s> since the original letter was sent there has been an election and a new authority has been elected <e> <s> will the noble earl give it time to settle in first <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the supplementary

training and also in the new technologies and developments that are taking place so rapidly <e> <s> is he prepared to recognise that without the training of engineers our competitiveness in the world will go down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply and having seen the increase in

doing in this direction <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness to consider the figures in lancashire which have gone from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and at the same time to read the chief constables report on delinquency and crimes among the juvenile population which have increased also by per cent <e> <s> does she agree that there may be a link between the chief constables figures and the percentage increase shown in the figures produced by the education department and that truancy may lead perhaps to glue-sniffing shop-lifting and drug taking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister is doing his best to answer these questions <e> <s> those of us who live in the area both in birmingham and in lancashire are aware of the commercial difficulties but we are trying to stress to the minister and to the government not just the commercial side but the compassionate side as well <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister feel that the low salary that is paid to such therapists is one of the reasons for such a great shortage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there are education authorities in england and wales and that the majority are good first-class authorities doing a splendid job under difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether she will go on encouraging the engineering council in the way that they are going in making suggestions for people from their ranks to take up posts in education <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that within the statement there is provision for additional moneys that will be made available for the teachers pay settlement when the teachers remuneration bill has gone through this house <e> <s> that is anticipating that it will go through this house in its present form <e> <s> however may i ask the minister regarding the education act what additional moneys have been made available to implement the provisions within that act which demand quite a lot of additional expenditure by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i go on to ask what about the act <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords may i then ask the minister whether this is not a settlement but a statement of intent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for initiating the debate <e> <s> i come from a region of the country the north-west region of lancashire which has boasted over the years of the way in which it has contributed towards the national wealth of the country <e> <s> we are a proud people <e> <s> we do not come before the government at this time with a begging bowl in our hands but we come asking for what we think is right and due to us because so much has been taken away over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords quite a number of noble lords are a little confused as to the letter <e>

throughout this discussion <e> <s> she said that the secretary of states door is open and he is willing to listen consider and take advice from all kinds of people <e> <s> i accept that the present secretary of state has been doing that since he has been in post <e> <s> but in the lifetime of this bill no matter what it is as it is at present or as it is proposed at present there could be one or two secretaries of state <e> <s> i have known secretaries of state whose door has not always been open <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down has he done any checking or conducted any survey throughout the united kingdom or throughout england and wales of how many units or hospitals are equipped and available to do the testing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred earlier to the inquiries which he had made of a friend in london as regards the testing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not find it very sad that we are discussing and asking questions about authorities which have not submitted their reports or have bad reports <e> <s> should we not take into account all the authorities in england and wales which have done a good job <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many schools throughout the united kingdom would love to do all kinds of things with language laboratories and so on but the difficulty is the lack of finance <e> <s> therefore they can concentrate only on the priorities before them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the speakers who have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken during the whole proceedings on this bill in your lordships house <e> <s> i have sat here from second reading right until the present time when we are getting towards the end of this bill <e> <s> there are certain points where i agree with the government and there are certain points where i agree with members on this side of all parties <e> <s> but one of the things that worries me now is where do we go from here <e> <s> that is most important <e> <s> i think that the majority of us in this house and in the other place want to see peace want to see stability in the education profession want to see administrators administrating want to see teachers teaching and want to see policymakers making their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords although i do not accept everything that the minister said in the earlier part of his statement and i do not accept that there has been sufficient study within the regions i certainly see the administrative worries of going to a select committee with all the questions that one would like to put all the evidence to be taken and all the research that will have to be done <e> <s> i realise that the select committee has a terrific task on its hands to do what it has to do now <e> <s> therefore i feel that i should <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how long it takes for a bypass to get on to the list and from the list on to a programme <e>", "<cs>

those waiting to receive messages about relatives friends and so on <e> <s> the minister conducted himself exceptionally well in the broadcast to which we listened with great sorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i remind him that his department is using this document extensively but is not allowing people raising objections both the public and elected representatives access to it and he has already stated that it is classified <e> <s> does he not think that this is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister how he can have negotiations with another department on a classified document <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether he would be surprised to learn that i have been invited to go across to the ministry of defence to read the document <e> <s> it would be available to me to read there but it is not available to local councillors or members of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i said i had been invited to read it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister on the financing of this authority whether this is new money that the government are to give to the nhs or whether it is to be a reallocation from various health authorities existing at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether this applies to rugby league <e> <s> does the minister have any comments to make on the disgraceful behaviour at cardiff arms park a week last saturday <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the secretary of state whether the teachers strikes of half a day will come into the figures next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain your lordships for very long <e> <s> i feel a bit of an

initiating the debate and for drawing attention to this matter <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord peston on his excellent non-partisan speech <e> <s> my noble friend will not i believe take that line again in the house <e> <s> i expect that he will be more partisan in future and i look forward to listening to him when he is perhaps in better form in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i invite the minister to go to lancashire to see how the operators are discontinuing the half-fare services for children <e> <s> they are now charging children the full price rather than the half-fare that they enjoyed previously <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that several universities have already made application to the privy council for changes in their statutes to bring them into line with modern thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ask his right honourable friend to take a leaf out of the book of the secretary of state for education and science who is announcing today that he no longer intends to close small schools <e> <s> perhaps he will ask him not to close small hospitals in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel privileged to enter this

standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what the minister has said concerning the additional salaries for academics in higher education <e> <s> however i should like to ask whether she feels and thinks that the government have gone far enough in this direction and will such increases stop the brain drain as indicated in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords in incurring the displeasure of the government chief whip because we are going on a little longer perhaps i may remind him that the reason we are going on a little longer is because we spent minutes with members taking the oath and that has now been taken off question time <e>", "<cs> which many back-banchers value very much indeed <e> <s> may i thank the minister <e> <s> we must remember that the report was published only yesterday and the government have not yet had time to study it properly <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister when studying the report to take account not only of salaries but also of conditions and all the other matters concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the initiative of the noble lord lord peston in initiating the debate <e> <s> i congratulate our two maiden speakers the noble earl lord stockton and the noble baroness lady blatch on their excellent speeches <e> <s> each of them contributed in a different way <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl lord stockton continues to preach the word as he did this afternoon particularly on those benches because it will be refreshing to one or two noble lords to hear that sort of comment coming from the government side

without telling us which authorities they are <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not fair <e> <s> the noble earl should tell the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not attacking the minister who is replying for the government <e> <s> we are saying that we expected the government to anticipate what was going to be asked of them from these and other benches <e> <s> on this side of the house we have not welcomed the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the question put to the minister by the noble lord lord williams of elvel as regards cases where these kinds of beds have been in use for some time is it possible through organisations such as the royal society for the prevention of accidents local authority associations the boy scout association and other such organisations which use bunk beds for one purpose or another for the government to draw attention to the dangers of the present structure through a publicity campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he is aware that all police authorities and all local authorities receive that form of grant <e> <s> surely such an event is a unique occasion for a county whether it be lancashire sussex or wherever <e> <s> will the minister again make representations to his right honourable friend the home secretary and ask him whether he will ask his right honourable friend the chief secretary to the treasury to make funds available from contingency moneys to cover expenditure which is unique to any local authority and cannot be classified as day-to-day administrative expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate everything that the minister has said perhaps i may ask him whether he will remind his noble and learned friend the former lord chancellor that he is completely out of date as regards what goes on in seaside towns where political conferences are held these days <e> <s> people do not want to go there <e> <s> they are frightened <e> <s> what is more the security is so great that it is no longer a pleasure to go and shop when

house for the work that they do <e> <s> i have been here for eight years and realise how much we owe the people who serve us so well and who are so generous in giving their time and experience especially to help new members <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in places such as lancashire where one town takes a certain action and the next town five miles away takes another action that brings the whole matter into complete disrepute and local authorities are crying out for the government to give guidance on the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords how much attention is paid to recommendations from consumer boards which in the north-west in particular are saying that there is no need for any increase at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when the education bill was going through this house a number of us from all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he like to think about what he said a moment ago about homosexuality and all our schools <e> <s> surely he is referring to some of our schools and not all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been trying to speak i do not want to interrupt prayers tomorrow <e> <s> this is not the time and the place to go into detail this afternoon because many things require a lot of consideration <e> <s> however i welcome the comment in the statement about work opportunities for young people

this question <e> <s> in view of the work that the engineering council is doing in the field of education especially among young people in the engineering world will she ask her right honourable friend to say thank you to the engineering council for the great work it is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the statement and wish to study it more closely <e> <s> however one aspect worries me a little <e> <s> i accept the view of our government and the hong kong government that it is far better to postpone change and have it right than to introduce something now which is not right <e> <s> but there will be many people in hong kong who will be disappointed that there is a postponement as the minister has already said <e> <s> can the minister give the house an assurance that there will not be any further postponements from <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the question <e> <s> many of us feel that the education reform bill as it is at present is a complex bill spreading over a wide region of the educational field <e> <s> surely therefore to add this issue to the bill will only further complicate it <e> <s> will the minister speak to her right honourable friend and tell him that many of us feel that it would be far better to deal with the matter in two separate bills rather than in one gigantic one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she thinks that in the allocation of finance to large comprehensive schools and other schools there could be such savings that they will pay for the administration and additional staff <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to go back a little <e> <s> he used the word complaint on two occasions in relation to both british gas and british telecom and the various services <e> <s> i am the former chairman of a consumer council <e> <s> we would differentiate between the person who had a genuine grievance or complaint and the person who was making a genuine inquiry <e> <s> in the figures that the noble lord has given is there any breakdown between the two or have all the figures been lumped together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord peston for introducing this debate <e> <s> i congratulate the noble marquess lord huntly on contributing in the way that he did <e> <s> i know that it is the tradition in this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister who made the rule that an answer should be no more than words <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of people putting forward suggestions to the department of education and science as regards which subjects should be included in the core curriculum does the minister agree that this subject should be added to the list <e>", "<cs> my lords will the written answer be more than words <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to follow and to congratulate the noble lord lord carlisle <e> <s> one is expected to follow a maiden speaker by saying nice things about him <e> <s> i can honestly say many nice things about him because we have had a long association working together in many ways <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that local authorities are making provision and have already made such provision in this years estimates for the additional costs and staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may go a stage further and ask whether when the second report of <e>", "<cs> it is not necessary <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> as a nonconformist i cannot speak for the nonconformist church <e> <s> a number of nonconformists who have written to me support the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may ask for an interpretation <e> <s> one of the opposition front bench speakers asked a question about the meaning of the word religion <e> <s> i have always understood that my religion is christian my denomination is that of the united reformed church <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether she has the figures of how many local authorities do not comply with this policy <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to oppose this amendment but i am interested in the situation that occurs in certain parts of lancashire and of the blackburn diocese where some schools now have per cent <e> <s> ethnic minority children <e> <s> what is the situation there <e> <s> does this change the ethos of the school or not <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to speak on the matter but nevertheless i feel that i should <e> <s> as the originator of the idea of the scheme in the s and as one of the people who persuaded cambridgeshire in the early days to carry out the pilot study on the scheme i am delighted that it should be included in the bill <e> <s> i support it completely <e>", "<cs> may i mention one matter to the noble baroness before she sits down <e> <s> when the scheme was introduced in cambridgeshire they did not have all the other schemes <e> <s> there are now about new items for the head teachers and governors to look at <e> <s> cambridgeshire was an experimental one-off area <e> <s> one scheme only was going on at that time <e> <s> all the other new proposals are an aggravation <e> <s> that is why we are asking for the scheme to be introduced gradually <e>", "<cs> i support the minister on this <e> <s> more people will volunteer to be governors if they find that they have more responsibility and a better job to do than in the past <e> <s> i support the government all the way on that <e> <s> it will encourage people to come forward <e> <s> there is nothing worse than being a governor at present when at a governors meeting the only matters for discussion are the minutes of the last meeting the headmasters report and the date of the next meeting <e> <s> it is difficult to get people to be that sort of governor <e> <s> that is what has <e>", "<cs> definitely not <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall not press this amendment after what the minister has said <e> <s> i ask the minister most sincerely to press on his right honourable friend the fact that we who have been engaged in this field for many years and who have looked at authorities throughout the length and breadth of the country realise how important training is <e> <s> we also realise how difficult it is for local authorities to find their own finance <e> <s> if the secretary of state wants the job to be done well then i am sure he must be prepared to pay for it <e> <s> will the minister again give us the assurances that he will reconsider the amendment and come back in some way at report stage <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is a further point which worries me <e> <s> one of the things we are doing in the bill is encouraging governors to have control over their own expenditure <e> <s> that is only right and proper <e> <s> nevertheless i am afraid that governing bodies might decide that they now have a policy for charging every voluntary organisation an excessive amount of rent for the use of certain premises which would mean that some voluntary organisations with no finance at all would be unable to use those schools <e> <s> in my view such points have not been properly thought out and i ask the government to think seriously about them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the concern of many parents of handicapped children about the length of time taken from the original application to the fulfilling of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords when the review is taking place will the minister take into account the endowments that many of the older institutions have compared with the newer institutions which are not so fortunate <e>", "<cs> i have my name down to two amendments on this subject <e> <s> i urge that this amendment be not pressed <e> <s> i accept what the right reverend prelate has said <e> <s> when negotiations are taking place as they are at the moment it would be stupid for the committee to try to aggravate them <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> we must be very careful about suggesting ways and means of dealing with the problem <e> <s> i do not believe that we can consider this afternoon whether we should encourage the keeping of attendance records for every class and other such matters <e> <s> that would impinge on questions of administration <e>", "<cs> i should like to support that line of thought <e> <s> in my area there are the polytechnic of lancashire and the polytechnic of manchester <e> <s> within miles of the polytechnic of lancashire based in preston is the university of lancaster <e> <s> it is good for them to work together and for someone from the university to be on the council of the polytechnic <e> <s> the same applies to the polytechnic of

not believe that the bill provides for the continuity that i should like to see especially since the existing arrangements have been operating for only a short time <e> <s> i cannot see any point in pressing the amendment further but i hope that the minister will look very closely at the situation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at the last meeting of the committee i tried to persuade noble lords to accept the amendment that we left with the right reverend prelate the bishop of london to see what could be done with it <e> <s> i now realise that he has done a great deal <e> <s> i pay tribute to the work he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the remarks of the government chief whip but i think that he underestimates the feeling about this bill on all sides of the house <e> <s> surely the government should have provided more time for us to debate this bill surely it is not difficult for the government chief whip to talk over this matter with

recommendation that the right reverend prelate has put to them this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to throw cold water on the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say this to the noble lord <e> <s> quite a number of authorities have colleges of the kind that he is advocating this evening <e> <s> in my authority in lancashire in my town of blackburn we have a college that began its days as a technical college <e> <s> it is now a general college comprising arts technology <e> <s> music business studies and combining academic work across the whole field from years to years <e> <s> it then continues with further education and that is excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords if one had read what my committee recommended some time ago this situation would never have occurred <e> <s> my recommendations to the government of that day were that each body should have a quarter comprised of teachers a quarter comprised of lea representatives a quarter parents and a quarter community <e>

education act went a good deal towards it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment before us <e> <s> what has been done in the amendment as it is now is to clarify much of the misunderstanding that has arisen while we have been debating this subject <e> <s> my own denomination and the free churches to which i belong welcome and support the amendment <e> <s> since it was printed i have had consultations with the leaders in our church and they support it completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am not a lawyer and at times i thank god that i am not a lawyer <e> <s> i thank god that probably

sensible way of dealing with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we are entitled to discuss the matter <e> <s> we are the people who are sitting here and who will have to go on through the night <e> <s> surely we should be consulted on something as important as this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how long is the lease <e> <s> may i say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he has been in the lyceum since it has been on the market <e> <s> those of us who have been there found that it was nothing but a dump <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the great concern of the noble lord lord nugent on this matter but surely to put down questions of this nature when the government have set up an independent broadcasting standards council is not the right thing to do

statement about this matter <e> <s> then we would receive the maximum publicity such as the prince received on thursday of last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however even taking into account the per cent <e> <s> plus the rate support grant which in the case of the conference this year would come to roughly that leaves for the authority to find <e> <s> is

and not just at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister makes a statement of that nature is he referring to businesses that have been registered at companies house or is he bringing in other figures about which we know nothing at all <e> <s> further is the minister aware that the exchange rate makes very little difference to small businesses and that it is more important to bring down the bank interest rate <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl accepts that we want only the best people to serve why are most chairmen of the regional health authorities members of the conservative party <e> <s> are they always the best people <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl name the authorities that are obstructing the sale of council houses <e> <s> further will he reply to the question asked some time ago as to how many houses are being built this year <e>", "<cs> my lords regardless of the composition of the council how independent will it be in giving advice from the department of education and science or any other government department <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome as i am sure we all do the increase in these figures <e> <s> however having listened to and read yesterdays debate about the training of engineers does the minister agree that one of the matters about which we must be careful i hope that he is aware of this is that if we do not pursue a good training policy those figures will not increase <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how many of these schools are maintained schools and how many are aided schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i support everything the minister has said and the action of her majestys government but perhaps i may ask why we have withdrawn i believe rightly all our staff in tehran and yet our ec partners have withdrawn only the heads of mission <e> <s> surely it would have been right for them to have withdrawn all their staff at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that several of us who are much involved in the subject are most anxious to stem any difficulties arising in our universities at present <e> <s> my noble friend has already said that we are waiting for a ministerial statement <e> <s> we can do no more than what we are doing <e> <s> when does the ministers right honourable friend intend to make a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when we were debating the education legislation and looking at the powers of governors and the moral and ethical teaching in schools that was one of the things that we tried to emphasise should be at the discretion of local governors and not that of the department of education and science <e> <s> surely it is for local governors at each individual school to decide that schools own policy as to what should be taught in that particular school in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not feel it is very sad that a distinguished vice-chancellor has to go away from his university for one year to deal with all the bureaucracy that is coming from various offices in whitehall <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord glenamara for raising the question this evening <e> <s> i believe that no one has done more than he over a good number of years to bring this request to the attention of various bodies <e> <s> we might differ a little among ourselves about dates but i believe from my research that he intended to bring the matter forward in <e> <s> unfortunately he left office at that point and the incoming government did not pursue the proposal <e> <s> we shall not argue about exact dates but i agree with my noble friend that the scottish council was set up in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he not believe that in view of the increased cost of securing conferences <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the department of transports calculations on use of motorways are always wrong does the minister not feel that it would be good if all motorways had three lanes instead of two <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl a question regarding the assessor <e> <s> i do not believe that the home office has realised the implications <e> <s> the chief constable who has been asked to serve as an assessor is a very respected chief constable and a personal friend of mine <e> <s> nevertheless taking into account the fact that the inquiry will be conducted by an eminent lawyer and a chief constable i feel that it would be wise for the home office to appoint another person and to name that other person <e> <s> i accept that the judge can call upon other assessors but i think that it would be advisable for the home office to name another assessor from outside the legal profession or the police authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate all the people involved in the matter <e> <s> let us not nitpick on who has done what and who has got what i think that it has been a team effort on behalf of many people <e> <s> indeed anyone who has had anything to do with the matter ought to be congratulated on having succeeded <e> <s> many local authorities are doing everything that they can to try to encourage industry whether it is in this country or from abroad to come into their areas <e> <s> we are only too delighted when they achieve what they set out to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords a british parliamentary delegation is i believe in hong kong at the present time or is leaving hong kong today <e> <s> if that delegation made a recommendation that her majestys government should look again at the british nationality act what would be the view of the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords why is the minister not aware of the content of the white paper when he seems to be answering today for the treasury and yesterday for employment and he is secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> what role does he fulfil and why can he not answer <e> <s> he seems to know it all <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may congratulate the government on what they are doing as regards training school governors <e> <s> however may i ask the minister whether he is aware of a publication and also of a pack and a video on the training of governors produced by the open university in conjunction with the national association of governors and managers <e> <s> will he encourage local authorities to use that pack video and publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am sure he is aware of the nuisance and disturbance caused to residents in areas where these parties are held <e> <s> while the minister is having discussions with the chief constables association and the various local authorities will he consider that the people who organise these parties should give adequate notice to give time for objection from residents local authorities and anyone else who feels aggrieved about these parties being held in their districts or areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject is of sufficient importance to be aired in this chamber regardless of time <e> <s> i do not believe that we have greatly exceeded our allotted time <e> <s> i thank the minister for his reply and i also thank all noble lords who have participated in the debate <e> <s> none of us wants to spoil the acitivities of young people we wish to encourage them <e> <s> we merely want them to be aware of the rest of the community living in the particular area <e> <s> will the minister try to speed up his discussions with the association of chief police officers and the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can clarify the second part of his reply regarding discussions with mr bailey <e> <s> does that mean that the des is prepared to accept a shorter length of time than the six years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that even taking into account his <e>", "<cs> my lords what support is being given to the london authorities in particular which are facing this acute shortage of teachers regarding the accommodation problem by allowing free housing and additional mortgages to teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the outstanding service that was rendered previously <e> <s> is he also aware that a number of secretaries of state had confidence in the committee and benefited from its advice <e> <s> in view of the present situation in the teaching profession is this not the time to re-establish that body <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of smaller firms employing less than people that have come into existence over the past four years does the minister consider that it might be better for the survey to include firms with about rather than employees <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the work being carried out into tropical forest preservation by the overseas development natural resources institute at chatham <e> <s> what additional money are the government making available for its work <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the ministers reply this afternoon compare with the report of her majestys inspector of schools which was published yesterday and in which the inspector was not happy about the way in which things are going at present <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that many mothers do not want the father to come anywhere near them would prefer that he kept away and in fact would opt to accept nothing rather than have him back <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is completely the opposite <e> <s> why should such a successful organisation which has done a great deal of work be privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords do we take it that that company is doing the work free and gratis <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that this firm is also the principal adviser to the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the long and procrastinating discussions which took place when the legislation was passing through the house noble lords will remember that we spent many days on the matter indeed we extended the number of days originally set aside for the purpose can the minister give us an assurance that instead of waiting for replies from hmis the department will monitor the situation very closely and will report back from time to time <e> <s> i thought we had received such an assurance during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> it is now some months since the implementation of the act and we are still as far away as ever from a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends lady lockwood and lady david have sought assurances <e> <s> it is all very well for the minister to say that the money is there but that is not true because the money is spread over such a wide area that there is insufficient left for the services referred to in the question <e> <s> the essential services need that money therefore there is insufficient money left for adult education and the youth service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i seek information on this subject as i was directed to do yesterday by the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> it concerns the training of judges and whether judges have sufficient know-how in commercial activities to give a good judgment on these cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however after years of conservative rule four conservative secretaries of state and all kinds of new legislation imposed upon local authorities without the means of carrying out the job that they are asked to do does she not think that it is now timely and proper that a greater financial allocation should be made to the education service so that it can carry out the tasks mentioned in the previous question with regard to special needs accommodation shortage of teachers and so on <e> <s> the list goes on but in view of the time i shall stop there <e>", "<cs> my lords after six hours and seven minutes and speakers and after writing three speeches during the course of the debate i shall take two or three minutes at the most because i have just torn up my last speech <e> <s> if i spoke for longer i should be repeating many of the things that have already been said and i do not believe in repetition <e> <s> we have a great deal of repetition in the house and i do not believe in it <e>", "<cs> i rise because i thought that the noble earl was about to depart from this subject and go on to the next part of his reply <e> <s> one of the things that he said was that the information would be available subject to a fee <e> <s> does he have any idea of what that fee would be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i draw the ministers attention to a report already published on this subject by the association of governing bodies <e> <s> that has reached the conclusion that there is an overwhelming case to be made for the department to change its policy on this because many schools are already suffering because of the present policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government originally underestimated the number of people who would be claiming from the fund <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well for local authorities to publish their plans but how can they pursue those plans if they do not have the wherewithal to carry them out <e>", "<cs> does the minister not think that it is for the people to decide whether they are paying too much rather than the government <e> <s> in may people will be able to tell councils whether they consider they are paying too much by not voting for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the minister a non-political question <e> <s> can she give us a geographical breakdown of where these schools which have opted out are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to take part in the debate initiated by my noble friend lady david this afternoon <e> <s> i am also delighted to hear the noble earl lord swinton taking part <e> <s> it is like old times <e> <s> we have been through many arguments and discussions we can now look at the situation with different eyes and see what progress if any has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords where will the funding come from <e> <s> will it come from the universities funding council or from the dhss <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but will he explain to the house what section of the dock work act consists of and whether we are getting value for money for the sale of these assets <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister when a final decision will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that grant-maintained schools do not contribute in the same way as many state schools to community activities such as school orchestras regional and county orchestras and other cultural activities <e>", "<cs> my lords how long does it take from the original application to the granting of a visa in moscow and warsaw <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware that government answers have taken twice as long as questions from this side of the house <e>"]
