["<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure and honour for me to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in three or four years time we should be very happy to measure the situation on a <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the question put by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in relation to the constitution is it not true that the leaders of all the parties who stood in the elections in rhodesia were well aware of what they were standing for and that they supported the constitution <e> <s> parallel to that could we not take the example <e>", "<cs> before we go to a division may i say just a word to your lordships particularly in reply to the comments made by the noble marquess lord aberdeen <e> <s> being in the last session responsible for the opposition on this particular bill i should like to assure the committee that the major part of my party was certainly in favour of this bill going forward <e> <s> it was not a question of changing sides or changing governments <e> <s> on a free vote without whips there was in the last session an overwhelming consensus in this house on an amendment to the bill concerning exactly this same point <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend reply to the second half of my noble friends question which asked which countries are exceeding their quota limits by using mauritius <e> <s> as so many countries benefit from association agreements with the european community i think we should know which countries are behaving in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend ensure through our representative on the management committee that the maximum price is accepted for the sale of butter <e> <s> is not the problem that low prices have been accepted for sales to russia instead of the highest price available on the world market <e> <s> surely this is where the commission needs very strict control by members of our government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he confirm that the way in which the sums are allocated to different dependencies is at the moment based on a <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say roughly what kind of sum the falkland islands will receive when they are likely to receive it and whether there will be sufficient to meet some of the expense of purchasing the roy cove farm which i believe is very helpful in getting new settlers to go to the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend please confirm that unless something is done by this government and by the community to assist in improving the economic situation of the falkland islanders the future of the present population is at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord gisborough for introducing this subject tonight <e> <s> i know that we shall listen with great interest to the reply of my noble friend the minister to these various comments <e> <s> from listening to the noble lord lord bruce of donington who with his usual exuberance defends his cause nobly i began to wonder whether everybody who was not employed by a local authority might be termed a cowboy <e> <s> it seemed rather that way by the time he had finished his speech <e> <s> nevertheless i think that there is something to be said for things being done by local authorities as well as for some measure of privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i established the debate on the basis of the signatories to the helsinki final act and it was for that sole reason that i confined it to the states and not for any other reason other than the one the noble lord has already raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank my noble friend lord trefgarne for his positive and helpful answer to the issues that many noble lords have raised in our debate this afternoon and for giving such a clear exposition of the position of her majestys government on the outcome of the madrid conference <e> <s> if one were to say anything about the outcome of the belgrade conference it was the fact that there was a madrid conference <e> <s> one of the things we would wish to say from this house and shared i believe on all sides is the fact that we shall look forward to hearing a place and date for the next review of the helsinki final act <e> <s> that is probably one of the most important things to come from madrid <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i know that probably many of us will have interests to declare and i have a grand-daughter to declare who was born in brussels <e> <s> she is very small at the moment but her position will come out when we deal with the amendments that my noble friend lord bess-borough and i have on the marshalled list <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend when replying would answer this question <e> <s> surely the amendment as tabled by the noble lord lord spens while i fully appreciate the sentiments behind it would in fact apply equally to british citizens who have been naturalised and registered and would not in fact have the effect which he desires it should have <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i wonder whether i could ask him to comment upon two aspects of the clause as it now stands <e> <s> why is it that those working in the european community institutions who are not necessarily recruited from the united kingdom would not be covered by clause <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me to intervene on this will he not accept that one of the difficulties that we have had as members of the community is precisely because we have not had enough british citizens working within the community institutions to get us fair treatment as other countries have jolly well seen to it that they have <e> <s> is it not time that this government who have been seeking to get redress and successfully seeking to get redress in matters of the budget and agricultural reform should ensure that we have our best people working in the community institutions <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if he and the government take this line the best people will not go and work in community institutions because the best people are british and want to be loyal to britain and want to see their country served adequately fully and properly <e> <s> would he kindly take this discussion back to the minister and ensure that we get a better answer next time <e>", "<cs> supposing that under clause the person had not dared risk coming back home so soon and the child had been registered as a british <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i should have given him notice of this point because it comes under the discussion in clause an i accept this <e> <s> since my noble friend said that under clause an opportunity would be available for instance for an academic returning to this country with his children to register them as british citizens after living there for three years supposing this british academic so loving his country and so anxious that his child should not remain stateless had therefore to bring it back in the boot of his car and had registered it under clause would he then still be able to bring that child back and register it as a full british citizen under clause <e>", "<cs> in supporting very much what the noble lord lord avebury has said i should like to point out that i believe there would be an anomaly under clause as it now stands because of course all the appointments in the european institutions are recruited in brussels or in luxembourg and not in the united kingdom <e> <s> therefore if i have understood the clause correctly they would not fall under clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene but i assure my noble friend that my fears are not allayed by the way in which schedule is drafted <e> <s> if we do not get a satisfactory answer at this stage of the bill and some encouragement that the european institutions at least will be included in clause we shall raise the matter again under schedule <e>", "<cs> although i have followed many of the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i am glad that i passed that test anyway <e> <s> my other point is that i think that there must be some connection with the united kingdom in some way or other <e> <s> under this amendment there need be no connection of any kind with the united kingdom <e> <s> i have followed the noble lords arguments very closely and i have supported many of them but i thought that i should point out that there seemed to be some very grave defects in respect of this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could intervene <e> <s> it seems to me that we have rather a lot of unemployment in this country <e> <s> i am sorry to hark back to the european community but surely one of the reasons for being members of the european community is in order to benefit from the jobs available in other parts of the community that is in nine other member states or foreign territories to the united kingdom <e> <s> why is it that someone has to be employed for two years in this country or in a job related to the united kingdom in order to have the benefit of british citizenship for his child should the child be born abroad <e> <s> surely the whole point is that if the person is unemployed he should be able to accept a job anywhere in the world regardless whether his wife is going to have a child within a period of two years <e> <s> in a period of unemployment i simply cannot understand why the government cannot see this point <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend the lord advocate would seriously reconsider this aspect of unemployment <e> <s> we all know that there are nearly million unemployed in this country <e> <s> surely an individual or individuals who are offered employment abroad even for only three or four years should not be denied the possibliity of accepting work for fear of a wife having abroad a child who will be denied the right of british citizenship <e> <s> surely that is not unreasonable <e> <s> i should be most grateful if the noble and learned lord advocate would at least leave the door open at this stage in the progress of the bill to reconsider this particular aspect <e>", "<cs> i should like to put a question to my noble friend <e> <s> the fact that this committee feels so strongly about the term full-time is perhaps indicative that many of your lordships when they are working abroad are not working full time <e> <s> i wonder whether any consideration has been given to those members of your lordships house who do work outside this country and eventually have children abroad <e> <s> will they also not be british citizens when they take up their titles and sit in this house <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for the support which i have had from all sides including the noble baroness lady birk on the opposition front bench and the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the point that i wished to make was that as the bill is now worded it is giving grounds for disagreement on the basis of religion and i wish to stick to that point <e> <s> that is precisely why i put in the word permanent <e> <s> i am thinking of cases where there can be a judicial separation but in legal terms and in accordance with the definition of my noble friend which i accept it is neither divorce nor annulment of the marriage <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the eloquent moving by my noble friend lord bessborough of this amendment tabled in our names and in those of noble lords opposite <e> <s> i shall try not to overlap the points which he has already made <e> <s> however i should like to confirm that i and many of my colleagues from britain who are members of the european parliament including i would say labour members have received many representations both from organisations and from individuals throughout the community not only confined to brussels and not only confined to those who work in the european institutions or for them <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene for one minute i very much hope that the noble lords proposal that payment of tax might be one of the conditions will not be followed considering that there are at least million people in this country who do not pay tax but who nevertheless would consider themselves very closely connected with this country <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord be kind enough to withdraw his remarks about a police state <e> <s> i think they are thoroughly unacceptable <e> <s> many of us have worked for many years in brixton and in the area and know the people of all colours to be peace loving people although there may be a few both black and white who are objectionable and behaving badly but i very strongly resent the implication that any part of this country is a police state and i hope the noble lord will be good enough to withdraw the remark <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would allow me to make just one comment <e> <s> as he may know i am a euro member of parliament and have in my constituency something like asians <e> <s> in that particular community there are of course many women who live very much at home and can hardly speak any english whatever <e> <s> that is the way of life they follow <e> <s> the husbands on the other hand are out at work and speak perfectly good english or at any rate it is reasonable enough to pass a language test <e> <s> what i am afraid of in the way the schedule is worded at present is that you will get a husband who is perfectly able to pass the test and children who speak english as good as the english that you or i learnt to speak at school but the mother who is at home will probably not learn any english at all or very little and may not be able to pass the test <e> <s> therefore one might have the situation where the husband and children would be eligible for naturalisation but the wife would not <e> <s> i wonder if my noble friend would be good enough to look at this case with some sympathy to see if there can be a form of words to meet the kind of situation which many noble lords have raised in the committee tonight <e>", "<cs> will my noble and learned friend say what measures the home office are taking in order to make the necessary administrative provisions to deal with the situation <e> <s> presumably minors will be registered through applications to the home secretary from abroad and presumably will need passports and other documents for travel <e> <s> we no longer live in an era where people stay in the same place for or years and i hope the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will be able to tell us what measures the home office are already setting up to deal with this problem <e>", "<cs> what my noble friend lord eccles said i think should move the house because it was our hearts that were deciding upon the outcome of this amendment <e>", "<cs> first i must apologise to my noble friend lord renton because when i attempted to speak earlier i was not aware that he had not terminated his speech <e> <s> i think we are all agreed on the political and strategic importance of gibraltar the loyalty of its citizens and their devotion to the united kingdom and above all to the crown <e> <s> we are also aware of the loyalty and respect that we in this house have for those citizens of gibraltar <e> <s> but i think it has also been accepted by all sides of this chamber and by another place that the purpose of this british nationality bill is to define for the first time in our history our nationality by our territory that of the united kingdom and for the time being at any rate gibraltar is not a part of the united kingdom <e> <s> from this of course many consequences flow from the terms of the bill as it stands at present <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has been discussing the question whether a descendent should be in a better position than a parent that if you have a british citizen by descent it would be unfair if he could then have a child who was a british citizen <e> <s> i think that is roughly the argument <e> <s> how then would you compare somebody who becomes a full british citizen by naturalisation neither of whose parents had anything to do with this country <e> <s> would my noble and learned friend say that was also unfair <e> <s> i do not think we can talk about parallels of that kind and whether anybody improves the situation between themselves and their parents <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to noble lords who have supported the principle of this amendment from the benches opposite <e> <s> i very warmly welcome the per cent <e> <s> support from the cross-benches and i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for his comments <e> <s> he will of course appreciate that i recognised that the drafting was not perfect that it would not as it stands at the moment cover those coming after the bill has been passed <e> <s> but i hope he has taken on board the principle on which i have been seeking to impress the committee that some action should be taken by the government <e> <s> on the understanding that my noble and learned friend will look at the purpose of this amendment i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i was asked whether i was satisfied with the explanation given by my noble and learned friend the lord advocate he will understand if i say i was not <e> <s> we have not been given very much guidance as to the choice parents would take between registering by entitlement under clause when the child is born abroad and hopefully waiting and trying to smuggle this stateless child into the united kingdom in order to be able to register after a suitable number of years under clause to become a full citizen <e> <s> i think these options are undesirable without benefit of remedy which this amendment would give the opportunity to the parents to do <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate will look a little more closely at this amendment in the light of the comments that have been made during these past few minutes that he will realise that nowadays we live in a very mobile society that because of unemployment people are very willing to go to the continent for a short period of time and that people want to be able to take their families with them they do not want to have to leave them at home in order to have children born in this country they want to have them wherever they may be <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before my noble friend replies i may put one or two questions to him as to the implementation of the provisions of this schedule as it now stands <e> <s> as my noble friend rightly says to some extent at any rate the bill contributes to reducing statelessness but it is worth recalling to your lordships what article of the convention actually says <e> <s> the very first sentence says <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be convenient if i spoke now to my amendment because it covers the same point as that mentioned by the noble lord lord gifford in moving his amendment <e> <s> over and over again i have put questions to the government about choice being given to british citizens by descent to register their children under clause or to come back to this country spend three years here and register under clause <e> <s> if they do not register under clause either because they have failed to do so or because they do not come within the strict provisions of clause that they are employed by a british <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps again i have misunderstood the bill but under clause and i am afraid it is inevitable that we have to go back to it since as i understand it schedule is really the safety net to the previous clauses of the bill of course it is only applicable to a minor whereas paragraph of schedule would apply to anybody of any age who was born outside the united kingdom <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble friend has said i sincerely hope that it would not take the home office so long to deal with this clause that the person would be dead by the time the application came through <e> <s> would my noble friend confirm that it is not necessary for somebody under this schedule to have a father or mother who is a british citizen by descent <e> <s> is that also one of the differences between this paragraph of this schedule and clause where of course clearly one of the parents at least has to be a british citizen by descent <e> <s> is that one of the distinctions which exist between this paragraph and clause <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend for intervening again on this point but following on what the noble lord lord avebury has just said would my noble friend also direct his attention to those parents who will be wishing to send their children back to boarding schools in this country or any other form of education <e> <s> will these children stateless as they may be be able to come in on their own regardless of having a parent with them or not <e>", "<cs> i understand that the clause proposed by the noble and learned lords basically attempts to set out some of the civil and political rights under the various international agreements to which the united kingdom is already a signatory and indeed it has ratified many international instruments <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord as a matter of fact is suddenly granting to british citizens completely new rights from which i was certainly not aware that we could benefit <e> <s> the first is the right to a passport <e> <s> i never knew until tonight that i might have the right to a passport <e> <s> i believe that is a new right which has been declared in this clause <e> <s> i think therefore it would take quite a long time to discuss tonight who and why and how one should have the right to a passport <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the principle which has been so eloquently put by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead and at the same time to support the reasons which were given by my noble friend lord colville for not being able to accept the amendment in the form in which it has been drafted <e> <s> in a democracy surely no form of public measure should be without some form of public control so that an individual can know why he has been treated one way or another <e> <s> it is for this reason that i support some form of judicial review as outlined by my noble friend lord colville <e>", "<cs> my lords before embarking on a short argument about the question of statelessness i should first like to thank the government most warmly for introducing into the bill even at this late stage measures to remove the very large number of cases which could have resulted in statelessness <e> <s> secondly i should like to put a question to my noble friend the minister so that while i am speaking on other aspects of this amendment he could possibly be finding out the answer to my question <e> <s> my question is this where a child is born in this country who would be stateless could a parent apply under clause for registration as a minor at the discretion of the secretary of state apart from subsection of clause <e> <s> supposing the child was born stateless and had been here for perhaps six months or a year would a parent be able to apply to the secretary of state for registration as a british citizen <e> <s> clearly if that were possible under clause it would remove the necessity for the amendment proposed by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put the question to my noble friend the minister and i hope that he will be able to give me a reply <e> <s> the fact that there is a possibility under subsection may be regarded as exclusive but on the other hand it may not <e> <s> therefore i would be grateful for a reply to that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i have put down amendment no <e> <s> which deals precisely with the question of upgrading <e>", "<cs> my lords in warmly welcoming this amendment to the bill i should like to make three brief points <e> <s> first the comprehension of the government of the very real worries and concerns of british citizens abroad has been recognised and i hope that the maximum press and publicity is given to this not only in order to show that the government have shown comprehension but also to allay the fears of those who have written in significant numbers to those of us who have taken part in these debates and those who have through organisations been writing to us <e> <s> i think that it is certainly worth recalling to your lordships house the letter of the leader of one organisation who wrote saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to put a question to him <e> <s> he has rightly referred to clause on which i think many people will be relying in future and under this subsection of clause a parent could apply on behalf of a minor child <e> <s> but what will happen if one of the category of children to whom the noble lord lord pitt has referred happens to be in care in a remand home or no longer living with his parents <e> <s> there are many cases of the kind of child to whom the noble lord lord pitt has referred of whom those of us who have done voluntary work are only too well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the support i have had from other noble lords in the house on this amendment and i am also grateful to my noble friend the minister for giving what can be called more than a full reply <e> <s> but of course he has not been able totally to allay the very genuine fears of those few people who will be affected by the bill as it stands <e> <s> i think my noble friend has indeed recognised that there is this anomalous position between clause and clause and the question of having <e>", "<cs> my lords before this short debate is terminated i should like to reassure the noble and learned lord that this amendment is anything but unclear to those whom it affects <e> <s> judging by the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of your lordships i should like to add a few words and to speak both to the motion and to the amendment tabled by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships for not having put down my name beforehand but i returned from brussels only at lunchtime today and found that the list had already been prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my thanks to the noble and learned lord lord scarman not only for his impressive introduction but also if i may dare to say so for the charm and brilliant persuasion that he used in brussels in order that such a positive contribution as the th competition report should be produced very much at the same time as the select committees report which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply will he appreciate that there are only two member states which do not already have regulations to deal with this problem and that one is the united kingdom <e> <s> will the goverment please put forward proposals as soon as possible in order to implement this part of the resolution of the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i did imply that there was one other country <e> <s> will the noble lord take on board that there are at least a quarter of a million british citizens resident in the european community outside the united kingdom who are very anxious not to be deprived of their civil and political rights to take part in any election which affects them individually <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister kindly consider the possibility of giving proxy votes to residents within the community <e> <s> this might be one <e>", "<cs> my lords if at any time we have wondered why this question was being put to your lordships and in particular to my noble friend lord belstead this evening while the country is engaged in defending our people in the south atlantic we have already heard from my noble friend lord ailsa and the noble lord lord avebury very good reasons why we should not be neglecting this part of the world and should be turning our attention to the importance and significance of what is happening in the horn of africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord kinnoull for having initiated this debate today in particular for his prophetic powers if not his good fortune in having the debate on what i believe can be called an historic day for british fishermen <e> <s> all of us in this house will have been extremely moved by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will wish me to express our thanks to the noble lord lord john-mackie for having so ably sprung to the defence of his noble kinsman and introduced the report on his behalf <e> <s> i am also sure that the house will wish to thank the noble lord lord mackie of benshie despite his lateness for having stood up at once and given his own views on the report <e> <s> i know that this will be most helpful to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the admirable way in which the noble lord lord hylton put his unstarred question will i think arouse in us a great amount of curiosity and interest to hear the replies of my noble friend when he answers at the end of the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton clearly shows a very great detailed and personal knowledge of events in northern ireland which one can only admire <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will be giving very full and detailed replies to those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl did not quite hear what i said or perhaps i did not put it clearly in which case i apologise <e> <s> i am saying that the objective of sinn fein is to turn the irish republic and northern ireland into an irish socialist democratic state <e> <s> this they have always said and they go on repeating it <e> <s> whatever the noble earl may say these are the facts as i understand them <e> <s> i am merely saying that not very long ago i happened to hear this on the radio in italy <e> <s> whether or not the noble earl likes to argue with me that is what i heard and that is what sinn fein are saying <e> <s> i am not saying that what happens in ulster will mean that this will happen if there should be unity of ireland <e> <s> i am saying that this is the objective of sinn fein and that this is the objective behind terrorism in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> the fact that ulster remains ulster and part of the united kingdom means that a unified ireland which some people wish to see is protected at least from becoming a socialist democratic state under sinn fein <e> <s> i hope i have now made myself a little clearer if not totally clear to the noble earl <e> <s> nevertheless because of the kind of broadcasts which are taking place in europe and the kind of information that is being spread in europe as noble lords know <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will wish me to congratulate most warmly the noble and gallant lord lord cameron on his most impressive and well-informed maiden speech <e> <s> this distinguished member of the royal air force who reached the highest rank of marshal is of course known not only as a man of action but as an outstanding thinker and many of us in this house will welcome the fact that he is not only an outstanding thinker

notified my noble friend lady trumpington of one or two questions that i may ask <e> <s> i hope that if i exceed my quota of questions she will understand and of course i shall expect a written reply at some later stage and on no account an immediate reply tonight <e> <s> clearly questions of nationality are very confusing and as the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out even the learned officials at the home office do not always get it per cent <e> <s> right and have to send an amendment to their statement <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me to put a supplementary question <e> <s> i was not quite clear whether she said that the passport would be introduced on st january <e> <s> if she cannot say i quite understand but could she say whether it is expected to be introduced on that date <e>", "<cs> my lords for some time now over the last year or so irish members of all the four political parties have in various fora been drawing attention to the situation in

that anybody would accuse him of wanting constitutional progress and so i think that we are going to be in a slight difficulty there <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that all british members in the european parliament protested strongly and loudly against the very irresponsible action of the majority in the european parliament on thursday <e> <s> the british contingent

get the british government to find a satisfactory means of dealing with the community budget overspill <e> <s> this was pointed out loud and clear by british members in the european parliament <e> <s> from what my noble friend has said i am quite certain that this is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as regards this particular form of pier the commissions attention

certain powers were given to the community years ago and there was no democratic control at all of those powers <e> <s> would he consider that what the european parliament are looking for at the

delay is of course the delays by the national authorities who are not always very quick on the uptake in coming to the european parliament asking for waiving of immunity <e> <s> the other reason is that where the member has the dual mandate in each case every time the european parliament waits for a decision from the national parliament before taking any decision because it is usually left to the national parliament to decide whether or not they wish to waive the immunity <e> <s> i think on an analysis of the cases before the european parliament these have been the main reasons why there

in this part of the world and our prosperity in this country depend intimately on our membership of the community and on making that membership a success <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree that the cap in its budgetary aspects has caused the greatest problem precisely because prices have been allowed to rise and have been decided by governments at their agricultural prices meetings year after year <e> <s> they have given massive rises so that farmers have been encouraged to produce more and more when that more and more was no longer able to be sold <e> <s> it is an international problem because the markets as we know have become more and more restrictive <e> <s> we are in the same position as america in seeking markets and having a surplus of stores <e> <s> as an example a

responsible to parliament for all acts connected with animals particularly in the field of scientific development <e> <s> since we are considered as other animals it is perfectly logical and reasonable that the same standing should be accorded to this bill as to the act concerned with animals <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down will he confirm that as a consequence of the governments policy on this matter a child of a donor will be treated in exactly the same way as a natural child <e> <s> is that a guarantee for perpetuity of hereditary peers so that through selection of gender they will always be able to have male heirs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his explanation <e> <s> perhaps he will be kind enough to consider this point <e> <s> my amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble and learned friend for that explanation <e> <s> i am afraid it goes back to the argument we had earlier today on the identity of the child and the child wanting to know who its true father is <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady warnock who has in fact come out with one of the reasons why this is not going to be possible <e> <s> there may sadly be a group of asian women who may carry on living with their husbands but may have aid the husband may be living in a world <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that reply <e> <s> if i understood him correctly subsection fills in the gap where the husband has not given his consent under clause so that the child has a parent in law <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i was concerned that the child would be left without a father at all <e> <s> i wanted clarification as to the legal position if under subsection the donor is not to be treated as the father and under clause the father has not given his consent <e> <s> i believe that my noble and learned friend has given that clarification <e>", "<cs> i am still fairly grateful to my noble and learned friend because this is clearly a difficult area <e> <s> i should be grateful if he could look at the matter to clarify the position which he has just mentioned where a child may be left without a father at all <e> <s> we cannot have that in the interests of the child <e> <s> i do not believe that subsections and are completely adequate <e> <s> of course i shall withdraw the amendment but i should be grateful if my noble and learned friend could look at this matter in view of the situations which could arise <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my voice to those who oppose this amendment which has nothing to do with abortions or romania but is to do with this country and the people who may feel that they have been ill treated or have had an offence committed against them through some action by the authority <e> <s> those of us who have had direct dealings with the electorate know of cases where women in particular have been totally frustrated and do not feel that they have been treated justly <e> <s> i believe that putting the dpp between an individual and the courts is depriving that individual of a right to justice <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears that some of my noble friends have informed your lordships that on this side of the house we have had applied a three-line whip <e> <s> i should like to assure noble lords on all sides of the house that we do not need a three-line whip to come here and vote on behalf of the government so as to support them on this bill on student loans <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that funds from the european social fund must be matched by either an equivalent or a percentage sum and that the source is irrelevant <e> <s> it need not be the government it could be a private source <e> <s> if the engineering training board was a private statutory company it could match the resources <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord renton has raised an important point on the role of the advisory committee in relation to clause <e> <s> if we just concentrate on the multi-disciplinary practice i understand that both the law society and the bar council are totally opposed to this whereas multi-national practices are already in fact on the verge of happening provided that the law society and the bar council lift their ban and agree to have them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make three very brief points <e> <s> first we have had many debates in your lordships house on training and education and skill shortage <e> <s> what has been evident from every side of the house from almost every profession has been that people have not been trained and educated in the profession which they have wished to exercise during their lifetime <e> <s> in this clause we are flying in the face of evidence that young people in this country have not been trained sufficiently for the job that they wish to undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for introducing this new amendment <e> <s> it meets the question i raised in committee and the great concerns of many noble lords in regard to the -hour period between the mixing of the gametes and the two-cell zygote <e> <s> it was clear that this period of time was not covered by the bill as it then stood <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble and learned friend for having listened so carefully to my objection during the committee stage that humans were being put on a par with animals <e>", "<cs> listening to the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for whom i have the greatest respect i was very much reminded of andrew carnegie who said that he was always being told by experts why he should not do something but quite ordinary people were sent to tell him to get on with it <e> <s> i am here to tell my noble friend lord caithness to get on with the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he mentioned my name would he accept that we are a debating chamber and on all sides we are entitled to approve one method or another <e> <s> just because a system was thought of years ago does not impose any obligation on any of us to accept that particular system <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble baroness lady blackstone that i did not hear her speech which introduced the amendment <e> <s> i was outside the chamber <e> <s> i apologise for that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord replies i very much support what the noble baroness lady phillips has said <e> <s> we have already discussed in committee the question of whether the name of the father should be revealed to the child at any particular time <e> <s> i believe that we have had very little evidence of any good reason why that name should not be given except as i understand it that there may be a shortage of gametes <e> <s> so far that is the only valid reason which has been produced <e> <s> if i was a child in that situation i would find that a totally unacceptable reason as to why i should not know the name of my father <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having spoken to the earlier amendment at the wrong time <e> <s> however i hope that now is the right time to speak to the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> i seek clarification because i am concerned to know how at the age of anyone will know that <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the reply of my noble friend with regard to the legislative process <e> <s> however can he give any further information as to the united kingdoms position with regard to joining the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords over the past few months we have been watching an extraordinary cascade of events <e> <s> it has been beneficial and interesting to sit back for a little while in your lords lips house and discuss the motion <e> <s> i join in expressing my gratitude to my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for introducing the debate <e> <s> we have already heard quite a few different opinions and the spectrum is so wide that some of us certainly myself can only address one or two issues as i shall in the few words that i wish to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the principle underlying this amendment <e> <s> it was an undertaking given by the government in the white paper that at the end of the day the maximum top-up loan would be equivalent to per cent <e> <s> of the grant <e> <s> there has obviously been a great deal of concern among students and academics as regards the way the top-up loans will work <e> <s> in view of the fact that this measure is declared government policy it would be a great advantage to have it written into the bill so that it becomes part of the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the desirability of monitoring such a scheme but i wonder whether i could speak against both the first amendment and the one setting out the detailed form of monitoring <e> <s> where there is government money involved over a period of time where there are going to be loans coming from the treasury it is automatic that there will be monitoring of what expenditure the government are going to have to face in the form of loans over the coming year <e> <s> it therefore seems to me that it is a work of supererogation to put into a bill of this kind where public money is involved that the government should monitor the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can also clarify how far part-time students can fit into this particular bill <e> <s> it is obvious that everybody in your lordships chamber will be in favour of supporting those who follow part-time courses <e> <s> it is clearly for their own personal benefit for the good of the country and indeed in general it is good <e> <s> anybody who wants to pursue a part-time course should of course be encouraged whatever age and whatever stage of career they are in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to take up a point made by the noble earl lord russell when he asked why any category of people should be taken out of part of the social security system just because they happen to be students <e> <s> many thousands of people receive housing benefit and other forms of social security but they do not have the possibility of receiving a maintenance grant from their local authority in order to study nor will they have the opportunity of a top-up loan <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that as members of the community we have benefited from the cap and that over the past years the item that has shown the lowest percentage increase on the rpi has been food <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put one point to my noble friend before he rises to reply to all the questions that he has been asked <e> <s> it seems to me that very few people have read section of the consumer credit act <e> <s> that section makes it perfectly clear that the student loans company would commit an offence if it sent to a minor <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that if the european parliament had rather more power many of these decisions would not be taken in secret <e> <s> matters would be monitored by the european parliament before the decisions were taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that decisions affecting the whole of europe from sicily to the orkneys and from portugal right across western europe are not necessarily taken only in the parliament at westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords about six-and-a-half hours ago when my noble friend the minister opened the debate he skilfully set out the provisions of the bill which are designed to ensure prospects for a major new growth industry in this country <e> <s> the bill provides a flexible framework to meet both the spectacular technological developments in satellite and cable television of the recent past but also for the future <e> <s> the bill must now recognise that television programmes are no longer confined to national frontiers but that there is an international and more specifically a european dimension <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for initiating this debate although he is not in his place at the moment <e> <s> in his brief historical analysis of our membership of the community without making any contentious remarks i should have been grateful if he had mentioned that it was mr heath a conservative prime minister who took us into the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in thanking my noble friend lord aldington and the members of his committee for producing an excellent and invaluable report <e> <s> i should also like to join him in thanking the clerks who worked so hard and <e>", "<cs> on monday there was a very important contribution to our debate by the noble lord lord winstanley speaking on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those of us who have represented british electors in another assembly on the continent and those who still do warmly congratulate the prime minister on having decided to enter the erm <e> <s> is the minister further aware that all those companies trading with the community and our export markets consist of eight of the nine top countries in the community will warmly welcome the possibility of having non-volatile sterling in relation to the firms with whom they trade on the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness lady blackstone was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i return to amendment no <e> <s> concerning the appointment of an ombudsman <e> <s> this afternoon we have heard from very distinguished members of your lordships house all of whom have been in important positions in either the bbc the iba or other important organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> we are in the rather curious position of having legislation concerning abortion in which the maximum time-limit is weeks yet if commons amendment no <e> <s> is not amended as proposed in the amendment that i have tabled which proposes the deletion of the reference to the infant life preservation act in a few weeks time this country will have a law which will allow abortion freely up to term <e> <s> as my noble friend the duke of norfolk said it will be permitted until the severance of the umbilical cord <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i thought i had made it clear that in col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he confirm that paragraphs b c and d are not subject to any time limit and that therefore the doctor is free to perform any of those terminations of pregnancy up to the full time of gestation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords and my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for discussing the amendment <e> <s> many points have been made on both sides of the issue <e> <s> i maintain that without the amendment and a limit of weeks we shall see a vast increase in the number of abortions under the provisions of paragraphs b c and d in particular b and c as we did when the abortion act came into force in <e>", "<cs> my lords with others in your lordships house i congratulate the chairman of the committee which produced the report before the house <e> <s> i also congratulate the clerk and the special advisers <e> <s> the report however deserves more than that <e> <s> we owe a great debt of gratitude to my noble friend lord aldington and the clerk william sleath as well as to the special advisers who produced a report which is a monument to clarity and breadth of vision <e> <s> that is supported by the fact that so many distinguished witnesses came before the committee including the foreign secretary <e> <s> it is a sign of the importance of the subject matter both for the united kingdom and for europe as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the noble lord say that the european parliament was responsible for raising money in the european community or did i misunderstand what he was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord the european parliament has no power over spending <e> <s> it has the power to amend one-third of the budget which is proposed by the commission and agreed by the council of ministers <e> <s> the power of the european parliament is extremely limited in regard to expenditure <e>"]
