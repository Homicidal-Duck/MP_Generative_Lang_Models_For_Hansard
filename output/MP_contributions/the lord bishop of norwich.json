it has in the country about which the noble viscount has already told us in his opening speech <e> <s> it is quite clear that there is a very widespread feeling that it would be an injustice if this amendment were not agreed <e> <s> the second reason why i should like to support the noble viscount is because it is our duty in your lordships house it seems to me to take particular care of those who are disadvantaged and who cannot always speak with the facility and ability with which the disadvantaged members of your lordships house are able so eloquently and well to speak as banner bearers for many others who simply feel helpless isolated and unable to make themselves heard <e> <s> for that second reason i hope the government will give a great deal of sympathy to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the word where in the amendment at the bottom of page of the marshalled list could be the same as when <e> <s> it is just a semantic question <e> <s> where makes it look as though there

the authority has served a notice <e> <s> the amendment says where i should have thought that it should be when <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord would tell us a little more about amendment no <e> <s> because i noted that he said that it looks like radical surgery but it is not <e> <s> the noble lord is speaking at some speed and the whole of pages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest care to the statement made by the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment to leave out the whole of clause calls into question the assurances which the minister has so clearly and helpfully given on the whole obscenity situation <e> <s> i happened to prick up my ears when i heard the noble lord mention obscene video films because your lordships will know that next wednesday we shall be holding a press conference when we shall bring some very assured and some very strong recommendations

used the word we rather lightly <e> <s> i could name two or three members of your lordships house who are part of a small group concerned with producing a report about video films and a press conference is to be held next wednesday <e> <s> i pricked up my ears when i heard the noble lord lord howard speak of this because i believe it is easier for us now to restrain all possible dangers in the obscenity world before they take place rather than as in this particular case with video work having to find out how that restraint can take place after they have been released to the world <e>

delighted to provide a copy to any member of the house who would like to have one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give general support for this amendment on two grounds <e> <s> first it is proper from these benches that we should have a particular concern with all disadvantaged people and in particular the chronically sick and disabled <e> <s> i see the problem of the noble lord lord ennals of norwich in trying to draw the definition so closely as in paragraph a and how easy it is for us to see the difficulty there in finding a specific method <e> <s> but with the goodwill of the house this looks as though it is as good as we shall get if we are going to define closely despite what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale was saying to us in the earlier debate about the difficulties of close definition <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will answer just one question from these benches <e> <s> he gave us the enormous figure of a million tonnes surplus over three years and it looked so simple from these benches and so complicated from the government benches <e> <s> but is this not the moment to ask the recurring question how can these enormous surpluses of milk with all the help of modern technology be turned into powdered and dried milk and somehow got to the millions of starving children in the african situation where life is quite dreadful and where part of the surplus could literally mean the difference between life and death for millions of babies <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me the greatest pleasure and honour to be the first speaker after that memorable maiden speech made by the noble lord lord ashbourne who is the son of a <e>", "<cs> my lords again before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he has read our parliamentary report and whether he particularly noted the finding that per cent <e> <s> of parents whom we approached and who were in touch with this very wide-ranging report agreed both that society has a duty to protect children from uncensored video films and that parents should have the final responsibility on what their children should or should not watch <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord would like to speak to the noble lord lord nugent the noble lord lord swinfen or even myself and others concerned we would love to take him deeply into it all and help him to understand all the work done on this report <e>", "<cs> i think we were encouraged by the fact that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby was happy about clause l <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak about the word significant in amendment no <e> <s> rather than about amendments nos <e> <s> and although it was a help to noble lords to have the whole of the views of the noble viscount lord buckmaster put before us at the same time <e> <s> we have been reminded by the noble lord lord nugent that in the other place a good deal of time was spent on this <e> <s> we are most grateful to have had a chance to read not only what was said on the floor of the house but also the intense amount of detailed work which the other place did in committee beforehand and we saw that the word significant was a major area of debate <e> <s> ever hopeful i think it may well be that members of another place will be expecting us to make some reference to this and it is for that reason that i am very glad the noble viscount has put this amendment before us <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself very much in sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with the amendments of the noble lords lord jenkins of putney and lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i should like to apologise to your lordships for not being here for the first two hours

brought me back post-haste to the house at oclock ever more eager for us to make sure that we have this bill as well as we can make it in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be pleased at that because i think the minister has set our minds at rest <e> <s> clause is really only concerned with there being reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone has committed an offence <e> <s> if we look at the sharply drawn areas where an offence can take place following this narrowly drawn bill concerning the particularly repulsive and unpleasant matters that it deals with i should have thought that on balance in the good ordering of the nation it is very proper for a constable to be allowed to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us whether the government are doing any research into a possible correlation between the glue sniffing problem among young people and the availability of cheap heroin among young people <e> <s> will he tell us whether it is becoming clear that the linkage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a brief reference to the discretionary matter <e> <s> i think the amendment is ill drawn because in clause on page at line it says only that the court may <e> <s> so it is a discretionary clause and even if we added the words of the amendment it would still not make it other than discretionary <e> <s> so although i also have sympathy with the tenor of the speech of the noble lord lord houghton the amendment he suggests would not in fact strengthen the position all that much because we are told that the court may order not that the court shall order <e>", "<cs> my lords theologically the minister is right because once a child is christened he is never re-christened <e> <s> so i agree with the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that the changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which helps us to understand the problem <e> <s> i particularly thank him for the first part of his answer that his friend the minister in another place may well be replying to us <e> <s> i am glad that the minister was in his place to hear that great psalm <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for rising before the minister replied <e> <s> from these benches we take very seriously the tremendous problems and pressures

debate was to underline the stake which the church has always had in adult education <e> <s> it may have lost its interest years ago but it is deeply involved again in adult education now because it

ancient house were most interesting and i should like him to hear my thanks <e> <s> in fact i want to rush to the care and comfort of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos who has now moved from the bar to the opposition front bench <e> <s> i want to come immediately to his support because having listened to the exchanges across the chamber and from these benches speaking always only in the national interest i should like to thank the noble lord for what he said when he made the very positive point that he believed in congratulating the government when congratulations were in order and complaining when complaints were in order <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord also answer one very simple question on his amendment <e> <s> there are the words has engaged but there is no time factor built into this subparagraph iv to be added and debated <e> <s> would it be any period stretching back into the early murky life of a young and still inexperienced conveyancer <e> <s> could mercy be tempered with justice in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord the minister on his very cogent and lucid exposition of the order and i <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be willing to say whether he draws a distinction as it is such a finely drawn question between the bible and other literature <e> <s> in the light of the fact that the churches main committee which represents all the christian churches has made such a strong representation about the bible is the noble earl encouraged by the fact that the whole of the bench opposite will know that it was gladstone who spoke of the bible as the impregnable rock of holy scripture <e> <s> does he realise that he has used the phrase this time of year <e> <s> does he mean lent and therefore the government being willing to abstain <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for that heartening answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he noted the bbc panorama statistics in relation to a recent survey of schools in which per cent <e> <s> appeared not to have collective worship as the act puts it which presumably means prayers and bible readings <e> <s> are the government anxious about this <e> <s> as an example is the noble earl aware that in norfolk which i know well despite a first-rate agreed religious syllabus the norfolk education authority has not appointed a religious adviser in the schools even though we have a lot going on in our schools which has church connections <e> <s> does the noble earl feel anxiety about this breakdown of regular worship in schools having particularly in mind that verse from the psalms that we have just heard <e>", "<cs> i hope that it will not be inappropriate for an english bishop to enter into <e>", "<cs> if it is inappropriate i shall not go further <e> <s> however in order to save the committee time i point out that i should have liked to have made reference to the matter when amendment no <e> <s> is moved <e> <s> i could put both my two fairly lengthy speeches into one if it would help in moving forward in this committee stage <e> <s> i shall wait upon the committees pleasure but i just put down the marker that i hope to speak on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should just like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list and because i want to oppose it at least to agree fully with the noble lord lord grimond about the gaelic representative <e> <s> over our home we still have <e>", "<cs> yes but the quotation with which i hope to sway your lordships goes back three years earlier the quotation goes back to the great statement by the then rector of st andrews j m barrie who said <e>", "<cs> throughout the debate so far there has been the note as to whether a general matter of confidence is important <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about that <e> <s> i believe that much of the anxiety behind the noble lords amendment and much of the thinking behind the anxiety expressed by the hong kong indian association which has also written to me concerns confidence <e> <s> your lordships may not have had the opportunity to read the major document entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that from these benches i believe that his statement and particularly the four points of immediate rejection by the secretary of state will be received with great relief because this is a living issue and not an issue which is designed to discourage or uncare for the ethnic minorities <e> <s> the church is deeply concerned <e> <s> but on a side wind for the report on pages to suggest the abolition of the collective act of worship would be wrong and i believe that all of us on these benches are most grateful for the immediate statement made by the secretary of state and for the statement now given by the noble lord himself who only a few weeks ago made that very robust answer concerning the collective act of worship which also did a great deal to encourage churchmen throughout the country in their task of caring for people of all sorts who are under their care <e>", "<cs> my lords as a tailpiece or rather as a footnote to the ministers helpful answers may i ask whether he knows that one of our own bishops in the church of england is married to a highly qualified and practising chiropodist <e> <s> does he feel that the fact that the bishop looks after the souls and his wife looks after the soles enhances the view of the nation about the bishops and encourages this magnificent profession of chiropody <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that my noble friend and colleague drew attention to the churchs working group because the churches really are determined to take industry year seriously and to help to remind themselves as well as the nation that we need each other that we are in this nation dependent on each other and that that interdependence is an absolute necessity if there is to be advance in the general good ordering of our life as a nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the noble lord to be encouraged also by the fact that the whole of the bishops bench also wishes to support each of these three orders <e> <s> i shall speak once only rather than three times and i am sure that i speak on behalf of the united bench of bishops in total support of the government in this matter <e>", "<cs> one hundred-and-fifty-eight minutes ago the noble lord lord hayter made a very useful speech when he spoke of charity and compassion <e> <s> the fact that the committee is so full tonight is another way of saying that we are a house and a chamber which believes passionately in both compassion and charity and therefore in the principle of the voluntary organisations <e> <s> in that regard i take comfort from the very clear statement by the noble lord the minister when he says that the government wholly support the principle of voluntary organisations <e> <s> i hope that that rings out from this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there may be the suggestion of a little self-help among noble lords because many of us have links with the great hospitals <e> <s> when we hear of a particular drug which is irreplaceable which one of the very responsible hospitals has discovered over a fairly long period in the first months of the operation of this list would the noble baroness allow us to bring that particular drug by name by letter before her <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that from these benches we would want to be associated with the tribute to lord george-brown who used to delight in telling us on these benches that he was a robust and loyal anglican <e> <s> he used to say it rather straight at our faces as though to say cap that one <e> <s> he enjoyed keeping us bishops up to the mark <e> <s> we mourn his passing with much regret and remember him with deep affection in our prayers <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that from these benches we want to give this scheme a very warm welcome because as your lordships know the church has been very much involved in what used to be called the mode b scheme <e> <s> it is particularly encouraging to hear that this scheme will be enlarged in the outreach of numbers that it will be increased now firmly to two years and that thirdly if i heard him correctly the noble lord the minister said that this was now a permanent part of the scheme <e> <s> it speaks very well not only for the fact that it has been unanimously recommended by all the different interests in this area that speaks well for the unity of the nation and for the leadership of the government but from our point of view in the churches it encourages us very much <e> <s> this is because through our industrial missioners i can only speak in detail of my own diocese of norwich but i know that both coventry and carlisle and many other dioceses represented on these benches would support me we have been finding that the work we have been doing in the churches in relation to the youth training scheme and to the manpower services commission has been giving us opportunities of practical caring for people which we could not have done but for the financial input <e> <s> the fact that that money has been there has meant that the opportunities for caring for young people have been magnified out of all knowledge in relation to the input of money <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister give some sort of personal explanation for choosing the wrong bishop <e> <s> i thought i was a right reverend <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord the minister to confirm one point in the very clear statement that he made <e> <s> under part ii article on the licensing of sex establishments did i understand the minister to say that when a council desired to give a nil return or not to license a sex establishment it was perfectly entitled to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with the greatest care to what was said by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby but i found myself not recognising areas of this country in the way that the noble lord appears to recognise them <e> <s> i was surprised to hear him speak in such protectionist terms about the growing video manufacturing industry <e> <s> it is a very large industry as the noble lord reminded your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl be willing to answer a fairly broad supplementary question <e> <s> i must declare an interest <e> <s> as an elderly and approaching senile prelate i now have grandchildren <e> <s> therefore i am interested in future long-term education <e> <s> without i hope in any sense name-dropping the other day i was talking to the first lord of the treasury in another place and therefore <e>"]
