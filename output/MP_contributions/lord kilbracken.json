["<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down could he give the house an idea of what his amendment at the committee stage would be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether interest will be payable on those sums of million australian dollars and million sterling <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord say the same about the bill moved by my noble friend lady wootton of abinger last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to be brief partly because a number of my points have already been made and partly because i intend to confine my remarks as far as possible to the question itself <e> <s> i join other noble lords in welcoming the noble duke the duke of abercorn and i congratulate him on a speech which managed to be non-controversial despite the controversial nature of <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope so <e> <s> i am disagreeing with the policy of the government in setting up a conference but i think that devolution can be achieved by a more direct means <e> <s> the official unionists are not the only ones who have shown their disagreement with government policy as it has been received with very qualified enthusiasm by the other parties in the north <e> <s> they know only too well that it will lead to weeks or months of wrangling and recrimination of attempting or not even attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable <e>", "<cs> as we have referred to the question of governments and whether or not there is a misprint may i ask the committee to look again at clause because surely the word government should be in the plural when it first occurs <e> <s> that clause refers to the governments of different countries which are members of the council whereas latterly we are talking simply about the government of the united kingdom <e> <s> i think that it is correct as it is written at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had been carrying armalite rifles i would have gone by a different road where i know there are no customs posts i would have gone via ballyconnell <e> <s> i was of course with a trailer arousing suspicion but if i had been driving an ordinary saloon car i would have driven straight by the irish the republican customs without being stopped they do not stop cars <e> <s> i was finally stopped by the garda when i entered county donegal after leaving belleek but there was no sign of the british security forces at any time and that is typical of the way it invariably is <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former bomber pilot may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that bombs are also used by her majestys forces <e>", "<cs> as another beekeeper i should like to raise one point <e> <s> the noble earl lord malmesbury said that they were only asking for compensation in the case of bees that were lost due to a specific new parasitic disease being introduced <e> <s> but i do not see anything in the bill to that effect <e> <s> i wonder what the position would be of beekeepers who lose colonies owing to the ravages of some of the ordinary indigenous diseases such <e>", "<cs> are the diseases that are threatened in this country so infectious that if they appeared in one colony it would be prudent and advisable to destroy all the colonies in a particular apiary or might it be the case that only one colony in an apiary would be destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure in this cosy little group to be considering a non-controversial and totally apolitical measure for a change <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that i am completely in favour of the principles behind his bill and congratulate him if i may on introducing it into your lordships house <e> <s> as i read it and studied it i became aware of certain points which seemed to me to be worthy of criticism or debate <e> <s> if i do criticise them or make suggestions i hope it will be understood that i do so in the most constructive spirit and in the hope that it may perhaps be possible to improve the bill in the course of its passage through this house <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful for clarification of that point my lords <e> <s> i should have thought that if a tree dies one normally fells it <e> <s> it may get blown over in the wind but if one is looking after ones trees properly then i should have thought with respect to the noble earl that if one sees the tree is dead it is better to fell it right away before it falls in the storm and does damage to ones neighbour <e> <s> that is irrelevant to the point i was making which was that if for any reason it becomes necessary to remove two or three trees in a line of trees in a street you have to replace those with individual trees and if you have to plant twice as many it may be hard to find a place where you can stick in the extra ones <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any real reason for thinking that the bill does not affect plantations <e> <s> if a plantation is cut down within a local government area the bill would apply to it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the aspen for example and the silver birch are extremely fast growing trees <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the noble lord to say that the aircraft was flying at an altitude of feet and that it was then cleared to descend to feet <e> <s> am i right in assuming that that is the height above sea level because the noble lord went on to say that the airfield itself is at feet <e> <s> in this case the two pieces of information do not appear to coincide <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that this is quite a formal amendment but i do not feel at all in favour of it <e> <s> i do not see any reason why a dead tree should be excepted from the provisions of the bill <e> <s> let me take the scenario where under the spreading chestnut tree the village smithy stands <e> <s> the spreading chestnut tree is struck by lightning and dies <e> <s> it is a noted local ornament and happens to stand on land controlled by the local authority <e> <s> they are then under no obligation to replace it <e> <s> similarly if there is a line of mountain ash growing along a surburban street and one or two of them die for any reason there is no reason to replace them <e>", "<cs> on that point may i draw the noble lords attention to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both noble lords for their support <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord has said perhaps i may say that it was by no means my intention that either of those amendments should be regarded as being in any sense a wrecking amendment or the sort of amendment which would change the operation of the bill but rather would make it more effective <e> <s> it was in that spirit that i moved them <e>", "<cs> in view of what has been said i suggest that i be permitted to think about it again and perhaps after discussing it with noble lords informally <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl take into account the amendment we have just approved which says that any casualties have to be replaced <e>", "<cs> i felt it might be convenient if i came in at this stage because the next amendment no <e> <s> in my name has the same purpose but <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord suggest a limit <e>", "<cs> i think what the noble lord lord inglewood said is perfectly right <e> <s> it had not occurred to me that of course in the case of a tree or years old no record exists as to whether it originated by planting itself or whether it was planted <e> <s> i feel on reflection that my present amendment is too sweeping and that it should apply only to self-sown trees under let us say years old or something of that sort <e> <s> i would therefore propose to introduce a different amendment at report stage and in the meantime beg leave to withdraw this one <e>", "<cs> i think that we all want to have another think about this <e> <s> i would at present be in favour of some such phrase as naturally regenerated trees under years old <e> <s> however i would not dream of suggesting that as a manuscript amendment and will keep it instead for the report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble earl on this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether this is the right moment <e>", "<cs> that is covered by amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> what is suitable is not always the best solution so perhaps we should leave this out altogether <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord consider re-naming the ulster office the northern ireland office in view of the fact that three counties of ulster are in the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords as the mover of the amendment i believe that i am entitled to reply <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i say to the noble earl that certainly it is the practice in forestry always to talk about regeneration whether it is etymologically correct or not <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is consequential on an amendment of mine that was approved at committee stage <e> <s> i should only like to apologise to the house for the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister spoke of a programme for the eradication of the disease and then spoke about treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak tonight <e> <s> i do so since i cannot remain in my seat because the noble lord lord elton referred in the course of his remarks to the discredited cause of the provisionals and later to what he called the evil cause of the provisionals <e> <s> this focuses attention on a problem that is felt by many of us who believe in that cause but who condemn violence with all the strength at our disposal <e> <s> after all the cause of the provisionals is a united ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i made it absolutely clear <e> <s> i said that the cause to which i gave my support was that of a united ireland the achieving of a -county republican ireland <e> <s> that is a cause which i support and which i do not believe to be either evil or discredited although i condemn with every strength of feeling that i can express the methods that are being used for its achievement <e> <s> having said that now i am on my feet i will only add that i deeply hope that violence will continue to decrease and that this may be the last time on which this temporary order of will again have to be renewed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just point out to the noble lord that i myself had to spend five years of my life engaging in violence at the behest of the sovereign of this country who decorated me for what i did and that when it comes to violence in this case i condemned it as vociferously as he did <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a long and rather complicated bill and most noble lords have concentrated on parts ii and iii and have been able to talk in general terms about conservation and the <e>", "<cs> the principle behind this proposal is very good but is the drafting satisfactory <e> <s> should it not be necessary to show that the eggs were taken or the wild bird was taken before the passage of the and acts as well <e> <s> some similar amendment seems to be necessary in clause which refers to the selling of birds eggs and similarly it should be stated that if these eggs were in the possession of collectors before the act came into operation it is legal to sell them <e>", "<cs> while i agree completely with the minister may i suggest there should be a definite article to replace the word unfledged otherwise it just reads disturbs young <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble viscount for his support <e> <s> i should like to point out that it is not only vagrants and so-called wanderers which would be covered by this amendment but also birds much less scarce than that birds of the sort which are said to be of annual occurrence of which there are a great many on the list <e> <s> i could read out the red-footed falcon the golden pheasant and the petrel fanpiper among others but in view of what the noble earl has said i of course do not intent to persist in my amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> there are two small points which i should like to raise on clause <e> <s> the first is that clause says quite rightly that anybody who destroys the nest of a wild bird while it is in use is guilty of an offence <e> <s> the point i want to suggest to the government in the hope that they may consider doing something about it at report is that the nest of a wild bird should also be protected while it is being built <e> <s> while the nest is being built presumably it is not yet in use <e> <s> i think that a bird should be protected during its nest building activities <e> <s> secondly in clause it is thought necessary to state that blown eggs are included in the word eggs <e> <s> however there is no such statement about eggs in clause <e> <s> i suggest that there should be <e>", "<cs> i do not view this as a matter of enormous principle <e> <s> i should like to point out to my noble friend lord donaldson that as i read it he would have been perfectly free to destroy the nest of the robin once the robin had finished with it <e> <s> the clause would then read with my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support my noble friend lord donaldson on this matter <e> <s> the noble duke has just pointed out that any woodcock shot in the month of september are almost certain to be home-bred birds <e> <s> i would say that all of them are because to my knowledge most woodcock arrive in the month of november with possibly a few arriving in october but practically all those around in september are birds from the increasing number that nest in the british isles <e>", "<cs> once again i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> he seemed to think that it was only your lordships grandfathers who shot snipe on the th august but i remember in the days before i gave up shooting that i have often shot snipe on that day when i was actually trying to catch up with some grouse <e> <s> it seems to me most desirable that snipe should be protected beyond the middle of august from every point of view but particularly in light of the provision in subsection on the same page under which the secretary of state can extend the period of the close season but by not more than days <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord donaldson who has done his homework so thoroughly that there is little one need add about duck except perhaps to mention one important consideration <e> <s> it is that as he mentioned some birds in particular the <e>", "<cs> i do not foresee that such a representative need necessarily volunteer to come forward <e> <s> what i mean is that if the secretary of state considers that a certain person should be consulted he can ask him to come forward <e> <s> but then what happens if he refuses to come forward because he does not want the order to be made <e> <s> if no one comes forward the order cannot be made because the secretary of state must consult such a person <e> <s> therefore as i understand it if a person is asked and refuses to come forward the secretary of state cannot make the order <e>", "<cs> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i should like to refer to the two interventions which have been made <e> <s> i understood my noble friend lord melchett <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this discussion and to the noble lord lord sandys for undertaking to take the advice of the advisory committee <e> <s> i think that it is very desirable in this case <e> <s> i listened with particular attention to the point made by the noble lord lord renton who picked up the matter which i had raised about the introduction of this strange other bird in the last line of the paragraph <e> <s> i simply do not know how this other bird gets into the net as it were <e> <s> the provision is that nothing shall make unlawful <e>", "<cs> as i have my name to the amendment i also should like to speak briefly <e> <s> i put down an amendment to omit paragraph <e>", "<cs> i should like just to ask my noble friend whether the other amendment which he might put down at report stage would be attached to the new subsection which is down as amendment no <e> <s> it would come later in the bill <e> <s> is that how he sees it <e>", "<cs> to take up the point made by the noble earl about the definition of livestock it is very unsatisfactory that he has told us that there is to be an amendment in another part of the bill which will define livestock <e> <s> however i do not see that amendment in the marshalled list <e> <s> in the meantime we already have the rather curious definition in clause that livestock includes any game bird wild duck or wild geese and the eggs of any such bird <e> <s> are the eggs of a wild duck livestock <e> <s> i am so glad that that definition is going <e> <s> until we know what the new definition of livestock is going to be how can we debate amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> surely it should be at the end of the penultimate paragraph only or at the end of every paragraph <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i should like to point out that i do not think that he has read it quite correctly <e> <s> he keeps talking about schedule birds <e> <s> however clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord somers should be congratulated even if he got my name slightly wrong upon persevering with this bill which had a somewhat protracted passage through your lordships house last year in the course of which it was changed and i hope improved as a result of amendments put down by the noble earl who has just spoken and myself <e> <s> one of those amendments left it free to the local authority to decide what species or indeed what genus of trees were to be planted as replacements and now the noble lord has returned the bill to its previous form <e> <s> i hope that he will think about it again first because i think that the local authority should not be hampered in its choice of trees but in particular because as i have often found one can plant a particular species and then find that for some reason or other it is quite unsuitable for that piece of ground <e> <s> that is obviously often the case with poplars which need rather wet ground <e> <s> if a number of poplars to give only one example have to be felled because they are failing it would be ridiculous to plant more poplars <e> <s> perhaps those words cannot be left out of the bill altogether but i feel that the wording has to be changed <e> <s> there are also one or two other minor points which i should like to raise at the committee stage with the sole hope that when the bill goes to another place as i hope it will it will be even better than it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might interrupt the noble lord the tree does not have to be replanted in the same place as the other one was felled <e> <s> that is under clause i suppose <e>", "<cs> my lords surely an avenue would not be a wooded area <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl and i will of course withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to look at that i am quite sure that he is right <e> <s> therefore i have no hesitation in begging leave does the noble earl wish to intervene <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for putting that question because it has enabled me to look at the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i agree with him that it makes the main point of my amendment unnecessary <e> <s> none the less it seems to me that it is not very satisfactory to have in clause a reference to a period commencing st september and ending th february when the close seasons already vary for different species and when there may be further amendments in the future which would make them vary even more <e> <s> i should have thought that what is required is a close season rather than any particular dates because it is the close season which matters <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord sandys would like to deal with that point now because i wish to raise an entirely separate matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise another point <e> <s> i should like to draw attention to the particular species in schedule part <e> <s> these are the live wild birds that may be sold <e> <s> it seems to me that there are one or two omissions which the noble lord might like to consider <e> <s> for example i remember that on second reading the noble lord lord burton referred to the rearing of capercaillie for release into the wild <e> <s> if a person is rearing capercaillie for release into the wild presumably there is a market in them and he would like to be able to sell them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and look forward to studying his answer in more detail <e> <s> however in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have one or two amendments on the same subjects <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that we take the birds in schedule and schedule separately <e>", "<cs> my name is joined with one of lord chelwoods amendments <e> <s> another one amendment no <e> <s> includes the bar-tailed godwit which my <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord melchett in what he has said concerning the noble earls reply <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl may think about it again <e> <s> it is quite mistaken that as a defence for keeping some of these waders in particular on the list he should talk about how extremely common they are <e> <s> i do not see why a birds commonness has anything at all to do with it <e> <s> nothing could be commoner than a blackbird a thrush or a chaffinch depending on where you live <e> <s> but although they are extremely common and in fact abundant they are protected and no one can kill them <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for that learned exposition and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful and a little surprised at what the noble earl has said <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mowbray is interested the mute swan can always be told from the hooper and the bewick because it has an orange bill and a knob at the base of the bill whereas the hooper and the bewick have lemon yellow bills and no knob <e> <s> also the bewick swan is rather smaller than the hooper and i am glad to think that in future it is going to be protected <e>", "<cs> briefly i should like to support my noble friend lord donaldson in opposing these amendments particularly the one which relates to that very beautiful bird the bullfinch <e> <s> i understood the noble earl who moved this amendment to say that this is really a problem only in the south-eastern counties by which i suppose he means kent and sussex <e> <s> it would seem to me to be entirely wrong that because a bird is occasionally a nuisance in two counties of britain it should be considered a pest throughout the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble earl to say that the bullfinch is on the current pest schedule <e> <s> what schedule is that <e> <s> it is not the one in the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> he has never had much to do with jack snipes but in ireland they are quite common though that does not affect this bill at all <e> <s> he mentioned the very different flight of the jack snipe <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> if you are going to shoot a snipe you have to be pretty smart about it and shoot it as soon as it gets up <e> <s> you might not have time to see how it would have flown if you had not shot it <e> <s> it is so much smaller than the common snipe that i agree with my noble friend that there would be no excuse for shooting it by accident <e> <s> in view of its scarceness in britain i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> so far as that is concerned it would mean only that an unauthorised person could shoot birds on that list in areas where he had the right to go <e> <s> it is not going to justify him in trespassing anywhere <e> <s> but in any places where he is entitled to go and shoot despite not being authorised he is entitled to shoot the pest species <e>", "<cs> will it work like that <e> <s> the noble earl spoke about the landowner authorising his guests to shoot a certain species but there is nothing in the bill which says that a person is authorised to shoot a particular species <e> <s> either somebody is an authorised person or he is not an authorised person <e> <s> if he is an authorised person he can shoot any of the pest species <e> <s> if he is not an authorised person he cannot shoot any of them <e> <s> i find it almost unbelievable that only a specially authorised person can shoot a wood pigeon <e> <s> the landowner may authorise people who come to a particular shoot <e> <s> he can say to them for the day you are an authorised person <e> <s> i authorise you <e>", "<cs> i may be making heavy weather of it and of course a landowner will give instructions to his guns before any shoot <e> <s> what stands out is that he can go and shoot bar-tailed godwits but he cannot shoot a starling or a wood pigeon <e> <s> this is absolutely nonsensical and although i would not dream of pressing the amendment to a division i do not feel inclined to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> is it the advisory committee which is pressurising the noble earl or is it the noble earl who is pressuring the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for his intervention <e> <s> exactly the same point has occurred to me <e> <s> i believe that there is a market for many of the species listed in schedule part ii <e> <s> the jay and the magpie though none of us like them very much are very handsome birds and many taxidermists are glad to get hold of a dead magpie <e> <s> indeed i understand that quite a number are gathered up from the motorways after accidents <e> <s> i do not see why an authorised person if he shoots a magpie should not take it along to a taxidermist and get or for it if that is the going price i do not know what the price is <e> <s> i was thinking of putting down an amendment of the very type that the noble lord on the liberal front bench has proposed but i decided that the proposal would stand a better chance of acceptance if i confined it to the species that most concerned me <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord sandys has said and i shall read it even more carefully tomorrow <e> <s> i find it extraordinary how often we are told that we have to take a cue from what has been done in the european community <e> <s> stories that i have heard about the way birds are treated in europe lead me to believe that they are slaughtered right left and centre by french and italian sportsmen yet we are suddenly told that we have to model our own ideas on what goes on in france and italy <e> <s> that does not make sense to me at all <e>", "<cs> there are two points i want to raise on schedule <e> <s> part i of that schedule as we know lists birds or species which may be sold alive at all times if ringed and bred in captivity <e> <s> there are one or two species i should like the government to think about before report stage if they cannot give an answer immediately <e> <s> i would refer first to the capercaillie which was mentioned on second reading by the noble lord lord burton as being a species that he personally raised in order to release later as gun birds <e> <s> it seems to me that if people are raising birds such as the capercaillie which are not game birds within the meaning of the bill there must be a market for them and people should be allowed to sell them <e> <s> then there is the quail which is not on the list <e> <s> i believe that quail are raised in captivity as poultry and they are very much valued and very delicious to eat <e> <s> i ate a couple in a chelsea restaurant the other night <e>", "<cs> i ate two quail and i doubt whether i could eat even a small part of a capercaillie <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seems to have misunderstood what i am getting at <e> <s> i know that there is no point in including old world vultures in this schedule but nor is there any point in including all kinds of foreign birds that are not known in britain <e> <s> in every other case the species listed are birds that have occurred in the british isles and i do not know why suddenly with hawks we have to say except old world vultures when they have not occurred in britain except in two cases as very rare vagrants <e> <s> you might as well include ostriches emus or any species you like <e> <s> i am not saying that old world vultures should be kept in captivity here <e> <s> i am saying that there is no reason to have them in this list and that it is quite unnecessary <e> <s> however it is no more than a drafting point and i do not want to make anything more of it <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will have another look at it <e> <s> but whether he does or not i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i begged leave to withdraw it but the committee has not yet agreed to that <e>", "<cs> may i point out that the hoopoes correct name is not <e>", "<cs> i should like for a moment to support my noble friend lord houghton as regards this amendment <e> <s> i moved a similar amendment to delete a corresponding paragraph clause <e>", "<cs> that amendment stands in my name and the red squirrel is another animal which has never been known to do any damage at all <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earl has admitted that none of these animals ever does any damage because he cannot give any examples and he can only say that possibly at some future date other species will be added to the schedule <e> <s> surely no species would be added to the schedule if it is found to be liable to do any serious damage <e> <s> if none of these animals does any serious damage what is the point of having this paragraph in the bill at all <e> <s> i strongly support my noble friend in his amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister explained that fisheries were water where there was fishing <e> <s> may i ask him to take that a little further and explain what fishing means <e> <s> does it include for instance fish farming <e> <s> i imagine fishing means taking fish out of an expanse of water with a rod and line or a net although i do not know if a net would be included <e> <s> it would be relevant to know whether the removal of fish from a fish farm where fish were being raised commercially could accurately be described as fishing <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that having got the bewick swan on to one schedule yesterday i have managed to get the red squirrel onto another schedule today <e> <s> i know that the noble duke may feel slight apprehension about this but i must mention that in my own experience the red squirrel does not do any damage to trees but perhaps i grow different trees from the noble duke <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask him a question <e> <s> i support him very much on this proposal but i wish he had gone on to talk about paragraph <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> i should like to concentrate first on amendment no <e> <s> which has to be considered among other things together with amendment no <e> <s> to leave out lines and <e> <s> if that is done it seems to me that we are left with a rather curious subsection which would read <e>", "<cs> it is a very difficult part of the bill to understand <e> <s> in the next amendment we come to the question of lines and <e> <s> i simply do not understand why there should be a ban on the growing in the wild of all plants there may be exceptions which do not ordinarily grow in great britain in a wild state <e> <s> i am sure that we shall have examples of this when the next amendment is moved but what the noble lord lord craigton is saying is that not by our unreasonable inaction must we permit or cause the growth in the wild of any plant <e> <s> we may not plant it <e> <s> presumably the seed can be sown which is an action rather than inaction but we must not permit it by our unreasonable inaction <e> <s> i do not understand what the noble lord is getting at <e>", "<cs> i think that is rather a curious explanation but i should like to think about it and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make too much of this but i do not think we should be afraid of making changes which would improve the existing legislation <e> <s> the point i made was that in cases one can foresee it would not be possible to order the forfeiture of the egg animal or plant in question <e> <s> therefore i thought it would still be preferable to make it discretionary but as i say i do not want to make too much of it and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to me it would be very difficult to order the forfeiture of all plants of the same species <e> <s> it is a strange fact that it is not going to be legal to plant in the wild plants that do not grow in the wild so if a landowner takes it into his head to plant some roses on woodland or outside his garden that would be an offence which seems very remarkable <e> <s> if he is found guilty of this heinous crime of growing roses in the wild the court would have to order the forfeiture of all his roses which are growing in the garden <e> <s> that seems to be quite impracticable <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble earl this question <e> <s> i do not want to press the amendment of course but in those cases where it is illegal to sell a bird or a birds egg do i understand him to say that it would not be an offence under those circumstances to give that bird or that egg to another person and that it is only when the sale hire or barter takes place that an offence is created <e>", "<cs> i am not

the winters there <e> <s> of course a great many more arrive from scandinavia and the north <e> <s> i do not see any reason why the shooting of woodcock should be permitted in scotland a full month before it is in england <e> <s> that is the situation at present <e> <s> it means that woodcock can be shot in scotland from st september instead of from st october <e> <s> i would have thought that there were not many birds to shoot at that time only birds that have bred in scotland <e> <s> i should like to think that woodcock at that time should not be shot and that the majority of guns would not shoot them <e> <s> therefore i support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word in support of my noble friend lord melchett by saying that however promiscuous the mallard drake may be and i agree with the noble viscount opposite it also starts its courtship extremely early in the year <e> <s> the noble lord lord home said that he thought the woodcock was the first bird to pair and mate but in my own experience the mallard is even earlier and has already been at it for at least a month <e> <s> that is a very good reason for following the proposal of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand that what the noble earl is doing here is to conform with the usage in the rest of the bill <e> <s> i myself regret this <e> <s> i wish rather that he had left out the word kind throughout the bill and inserted the word species <e> <s> the word kind is an extremely vague term <e> <s> there are all sorts of different kinds of birds including those that can fly and those that cannot fly <e> <s> i do not understand the shyness that has been shown throughout the drafting about the use of the word species which is an exact and scientific term <e> <s>

lords before the noble earl sits down will he confirm that someone who keeps birds in captivity and who has young birds that hatch will not be committing an offence during the period between hatching and registration <e> <s> the sole purpose of my amendment is to ensure that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having supported the noble lord lord burton on the capercaillie i am sorry to have to oppose him on the hen harrier <e> <s> it may be that this species is coming back in scotland and is becoming more common

granted and the threat easily removed <e> <s> i would say that the amendment appears to be faulty in that it refers to the pallid harrier and includes that in the list but that has only put in three appearances in these islands since records have been kept and it has never bred in britain <e> <s> it does not appear to be appropriate for schedule <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will be resisted

cannot be eaten and the only reason is simply to enjoy the slaughter of birds and whether they are common or not has nothing to do with it <e> <s> many of the most common birds apart from the pest species are already protected despite their commonness and i think that anyone who wants to go out and shoot curlew godwit or redshank is giving in to his basest instincts <e> <s> i should like to see the coot removed from the list as well <e> <s> i do not think that anybody wants to eat coot and if they do any harm they should be in the pest species and not in this section <e> <s> therefore having considered these amendments i very much hope that the government will agree to them <e> <s> if they do not i would invite noble lords to press the amendments to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious to support my noble friend lord melchett in this series of proposals <e> <s> i detest the idea of any of these birds being kept in cages whether they were taken from the wild or bred in captivity <e> <s> what has been a revelation to me since the bill began its progress through your lordships house is the large number of small birds which are kept in captivity and how many thousands

amendments from no <e> <s> onwards may i point out a small misprint in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the case of both the sickle-leaved hares-ear and the small hares-ear the apostrophe should appear

amendment at committee stage <e> <s> i put down a similar amendment at that stage though i never moved it <e> <s> i have listened with great attention to what my noble friend has said in moving her

any new species that they want to ban should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to cope with this question of the definition of poultry in my later amendment no <e> <s> a but instead of moving it i should like to make a couple of comments on the amendment moved by the noble earl <e> <s> i wonder whether his proposal in fact removes the objections that my noble friend lord melchett and i had at committee stage <e> <s> he certainly seems to be of the opinion that the word domestic in the existing definition applies to all the species or kinds of bird listed in the definition <e> <s> but we run into problems because of what we normally think of as being chickens which are referred to as being domestic fowls <e> <s> without the adjective domestic we just have fowls and that does not mean chickens at all <e> <s> so the word domestic is wholly employed in turning fowls into domestic fowls and it cannot go on to qualify geese ducks guinea-fowls pigeons and quails <e> <s> that is the first objection <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of pressing it my lords <e> <s> i know the noble lord lord burton is interested in the position of the capercaillie and intends to raise this matter again on third reading <e> <s> if as the result of any discussions he might have with the minister there will be any change involving the capercaillie that would make it more necessary to change the definition of game birds here and of course the capercaillie position is special in that it could not be in the act because at the time of that act it had not yet been established in scotland <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the vote is taken i should like to say a few words on this old favourite as it completes its second passage through your lordships house <e> <s> i think that someone and i take that duty should congratulate the noble lord lord somers on the great perseverance he has shown in piloting it through your lordships house on two different occasions <e> <s> there is only one criticism that i want to make <e> <s> i spoke on all stages when it was first before your lordships and in its present career i spoke at second reading

<e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord somers has said it is rather strange that nearly half the species on the list are not hardwoods but softwoods <e> <s> two of the others the aspen and silver birch in particular are extremely fast-growing species <e> <s> in other words they are neither all hardwoods nor all slow-growing trees <e> <s> as i said it seems to be a capricious choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i can agree <e> <s> i come from the same republic and i too talk about these islands <e> <s> is it not the case however illogical and unjustifiable it may be that the term british isles as defined in british legislation does in fact include the counties <e>", "<cs> my lords in wishing to support my noble friend in her plea as strongly as possible i wonder whether i could ask the minister these questions does the noble lord know that children of both persuasions go on holiday in groups together that there is never any trouble that they relate extremely well to one another but when they get back into the ghetto atmospheres of the cities there is no way in which they can continue to see one another and continue these relationships <e> <s> is not that tragic <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not very often that i agree with the noble lord lord monson but since i do on this occasion i would like to mention one or two reasons why <e> <s> my noble friend lady phillips spoke about pilots of planes not being belted up when their passengers are <e> <s> i think she is mistaken in that whenever there is turbulence in the air the pilot puts on his safety belt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry if i misrepresented my noble friend <e> <s> i took up her point because from my own personal experience not as a car driver but as a pilot in the navy during the last war i wanted to give two examples following my noble friends account of his unfortunate son <e> <s> during those years i was unfortunate enough to have four total engine failures and in two of those one over land and one over water i suffered quite severe injury although as a pilot i was wearing a safety belt <e> <s> on the first occasion when i landed in the firth of forth despite the wearing of the belt i was struck by the instrument panel and lost consciousness the plane began to sink and i only recovered consciousness as i disappeared under water <e> <s> it then took me over a minute to get out of my cockpit and a minute is rather a long time in those circumstances <e> <s> therefore i would advise all noble lords that if they do wear seat belts they should not drive into rivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene briefly for a few moments to take up two or three points that have been made by speakers during the debate and especially by my noble friend who has just sat down <e> <s> in particular i should like to confirm what he has expressed as his belief that the granting of political status is not a necessary condition of the ending of the hunger strike as i myself have been assured by leaders of the provisional sinn fein <e> <s> it is within the power of the government to end the hunger strike without granting that status by the improvement the further improvement of conditions in the prisons of northern ireland and i implore them not to go on reiterating no political status no political status when that is no reason for not taking the steps necessary to end all the opposing worldwide propaganda all the terrorism and all the suffering that is resulting from the hunger strikes at present <e>", "<cs> i was not going to sit down my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an intervention which could have been foreseen and i must say that it expresses a point of view different from my own because in my opinion religious education and church matters should be taken out of the schools and dealt with by the parents and by the churches <e> <s> i should welcome any move towards completely lay attitudes in schools both private and public in all parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course bow to what the minister has said but i would point out that i am merely answering a point that was made without interruption by the noble viscount sitting behind him <e> <s> therefore i do not think i strayed any more from relevance than he did <e> <s> however i had finished except to say that i believe that more credit should be given to the security forces in the republic <e> <s> i think we must remember that the prisons in the republic are bursting at the seams with ira prisoners and that they have been picked up by those forces the garda and the army who deserve credit for what they have done for the competence they have shown in a job which cannot by any means always be agreeable to them <e> <s> with those remarks i will gladly resume my seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself clear to my former noble friend <e> <s> the point i was trying to make is that as my noble friend lord brockway previously said the impossibility of granting politcal status has been given as a reason for not settling the hunger strike <e> <s> my point was that in the prisoners eyes or mine the granting of that status is not a necessary preliminary to their giving up the strike <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say what the position was prior to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene for just a moment on the subject of the diplock courts <e> <s> it is of course true that no jury courts exist in the republic of ireland but two blacks do not make white <e> <s> it is as much to be regretted there as it is in my opinion in the north <e> <s> to listen to the noble lord lord elton speaking about the operation of those courts one would almost feel that it was an advantage not to have a jury <e> <s> i do not believe that to be the case <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this question and could he preferably answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords are not all these or almost all matters purely for the government of zimbabwe and not for her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to rise for a moment to support my noble friend very strongly in his amendment and to draw attention to the fact that the number of birdwatchers is very much greater and their purpose so very much more laudable than that of wildfowlers <e> <s> i feel that the minister is likely to say that there is nothing to worry about because the secretary of state will prescribe large areas where shooting will not take place <e> <s> that is not enough and the provision which your lordships voted for should be restored to the bill <e> <s> i hope that will be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords again i should like to lend my support to what my noble friend has said and to his amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that he pointed out that the word urgently is necessary because in a case where it is not urgently necessary under <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps he could explain why the word urgently is necessary at all in other words why we should not simply disagree with the commons in their amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what questions the noble lord foresees being asked in the referendum to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only as a former wartime pilot in the fleet air arm that i presume to ask the noble viscount some questions <e> <s> are not the disasters of tuesday one more piece of evidence of the folly of sending the task force to the falklands with the protection of no more than fighter aircraft <e> <s> no more than i personally commanded on one small carrier in <e> <s> apparently those were the only aircraft available for the purpose in the fleet air arm and they have now had to be supplemented by raf planes <e> <s> is he aware of the extraordinary stresses <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly my lords largely as a result of some remarks made by the noble lord lord swansea <e> <s> it seems to me i believe it is more than just a committee point that the measure will be seriously weakened by cluase which says the bill will apply only if the imitation firearm can be converted without any special skill <e> <s> in other words if any special skill is needed no illegal act will have been committed <e> <s> i should have thought it impossible for anyone to convert an imitation into a real firearm without having any special skill <e> <s> it might not be necessary for him to have special equipment if he has enough special skill he might be able to do it with a screwdriver or some ordinary domestic tool <e> <s> surely special skill must always be necessary for such a conversion to be made and in that case the offence would not be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a point about the wording and punctuation of the second line in paragraph b of the proposed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the phrase by means of or on is really quite confusing <e> <s> i think it should read from or by means of or on <e> <s> the noble and learned lord might like the draftsman to have a look at that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl and my noble friend have both referred to the harrier and the sea harrier aircraft <e> <s> i cannot resist seizing this opportunity when i see the noble viscount on the front bench of referring to remarks i made two weeks ago that are not at all irrelevant to what we are talking about now <e> <s> i spoke then as a former pilot of the folly of sending so few aircraft with the task force to the falklands <e> <s> i gave certain figures which the noble viscount said were wrong <e> <s> he said that i had misled the house but he did not wish to correct me <e>", "<cs> i was referring my lords and said quite clearly i was referring to the number of aircraft and the number of pilots who sailed with the task force <e> <s> i specified that <e> <s> what the noble viscount has given are the figures for the total number of aircraft and total number of pilots who either sailed with it or joined it subsequently <e> <s> that is a completely different matter <e> <s> my figures are right <e> <s> they are no longer confidential and i can tell him that there were pilots to fly the harriers which sailed with the task force <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say how he reconciles all he has said with the fact that british soldiers serving in northern ireland are in almost all cases when convicted of offences there sent to this country to britain for imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says in this country is he suggesting that northern ireland is not part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government equally concerned about persecution by the iranians of the kurdish people and other minorities <e>", "<cs> my lords it is reasonably clear that the labour party is seriously divided on this important issue <e> <s> in another place a week ago it was announced as labour party policy that the order renewing this act should be opposed <e> <s> my honourable and right honourable friends there divided the house and there was unanimous support for the opposition although of course with very noticeable absentions <e> <s> in this house today we have had strong speeches in support of the order from my noble friend lord boston of faversham on the front bench from my noble friend lord shackleton below the gangway and from other noble lords <e> <s> i do not see any harm in such a difference of opinion <e> <s> this act is an extremely controversial indeed contentious act <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree that the majority were detained for fewer than hours but i do not see the significance of that remark because you start to interrogate somebody and if after or hours you feel that you are getting somewhere then you apply for the period of detention to be extended because the person is a suspicious character <e> <s> so it is among those who are interrogated for more than hours that you would expect to get a higher ratio of men charged <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> if this was taking place in an english county if it was not across that convenient little bit of sea if there was a move from a british county or an area in britain to cause terrorism to cause death and destruction in london the ordinary civil procedures would be used <e> <s> the people would be traced by the police arrested and charged under the law <e> <s> this is internal banishment telling people that they cannot stay in england where they may have lived for years <e> <s> if they have lived in england for years they are okay but if they have lived in england for or years they are told you cannot live in england any more you must move to

"<cs> it was per cent <e>", "<cs> i think the contents have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to express my support for what has been said by my noble friend on the front bench and i will just take up the point made by the noble lord lord hampton about the early renewal of these two orders one of which does not expire until the very end of july <e> <s> mine is a completely non-controversial question but i should like to know whether the period for which these orders are introduced months and six months respectively will run from today or from the day on which these orders would otherwise have expired <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the question be that the report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she and the government feel equal concern about the plight of the kurdish people in the same country in view of the fact that they are being subjected to even greater persecution and subjection and particularly in view of the major military offensive against them which was launched on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether most of the land being sold is carrying mature or nearly mature timber or whether it is carrying young plantations <e> <s> can he give any indication of the number of acres or the number of hectares that have been sold to raise the sums that he has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords my interest in slot machines originated from countless visits to the palace pier in brighton when i was a young person well under the age of and when i could win d for a stake of a penny at a game called the little stockbroker <e> <s> my interests were maintained through my membership of your lordships standing committee on the gaming bill of as it then was in conjunction with which of

not as good as it might be and that the simple way out is to use the same definition as that which appears at the beginning of part iii of the gaming act <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him to confirm that the republic of ireland is not part of the british islands and that therefore these arrangements will obtain between the united kingdom and the

the course of this debate and then legislate in such a way that such a statutory licensing body is established <e> <s> the acceptance of this amendment would not stop the practice of aid in the meantime <e> <s> it would simply mean that aid continues to be used under exactly the same conditions as it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for putting down this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords having occupied so much of your lordships time i shall speak for only a few seconds <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning said that nobody would thank him for his part in this debate <e> <s> i should like to thank him <e> <s> i should like to thank him for the amendments he put down and the

him <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation to my noble and learned friend lord silkin and to the noble and learned lord lord meston for their kind words <e> <s> i also thank the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for his patience and forbearance <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had two very memorable maiden speakers and i should like to begin by congratulating the noble baroness in particular because i remember how extremely kind her mother was to the young naval airmen of whom i was one at arbroath years ago <e> <s> the noble baroness would have been an extremely young girl a baby in arms i think <e> <s> her mother was so kind to us all and i am happy to see the noble baroness here in this house and to have had the opportunity too to hear her witty and thoughtful words

figures given both by the minister and now by the noble lord <e> <s> i feel sure that the figure which i was given was the figure for billiard halls which existed as such and did not include amusement arcades in which there was a pool table <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the delay in ireland has been due not to the wishes of the government both in the past and at present but arises from the private action taken by an individual namely mr crotty <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene for a very few moments first to express my complete support for what has been said by my noble friends on these benches and secondly to regret what has been expressed from the alliance front bench by the noble lord lord hampton in support of the order <e> <s> i also want to point out and put on the record that through-out this debate on a matter of extreme importance there has been for most of the time no other occupant of the benches opposite than the minister who will reply <e> <s> there have been no back-bench listeners or speakers let alone anyone from the two unionist parties in northern ireland and only half-a-dozen on this side of the house <e> <s> i believe that that adds to the evidence that there is a high degree of indifference towards extremely important northern ireland matters that is typical of this house and of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i crossed the border at half-past eight this morning and i should like to begin by confirming what has been said by both my noble friends that there is the most profound sense of shock and outrage in the republic at what has happened <e> <s> as i approached the border this morning in visibility of about yards i expected that coming so soon after these murders i should have some difficulty in crossing <e> <s> i have to report that the only sign of security <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he explain how the security forces in the republic of ireland could in any way be held responsible for the detonation of the car when that occurred at least half a mile north of the border to which they had escorted lord justice gibson <e>", "<cs> in rising to support my noble friend in this amendment i hope the committee will agree that the publication of guidelines along these lines would be extremely important and desirable <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend on this series of amendments <e> <s> the committee must be quite well acquainted with scrubs wood and will not need reminding of its importance as a habitat not only of insects and plants including trees but in particular of birds which are my interest <e> <s> some species are recorded as having been found there many of them breeding species <e> <s> but many more are migrating birds using the land on their way to and from warmer climates <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord say whether the figure he mentioned of is intended to include the purchase of the land or merely the planting care and maintenance of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a question to the minister about the british naval vessels in the gulf <e> <s> it was announced yesterday that these ships had been authorised to defend themselves if attacked <e> <s> as a former naval officer i find that a most extraordinary thing to say <e> <s> surely the royal navy does not need any such authority to defend itself if attacked <e> <s> can the noble lord give any further indication of the instructions to the captains of these vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords like every noble lord who has spoken so far in the debate i must start by declaring an interest having earned my living almost exclusively for exactly years by creating to use the language of the bill literary and artistic works which in my case mean books articles and photographs whether as a freelance or less often as a staff reporter <e> <s> the employer who owned the first copyright in everything that i wrote when i was a staff reporter for some years was the grandfather of the minister who will reply to the debate <e> <s> i confine my attention to part i which to a great extent restates the existing law of copyright but with certain significant changes and in particular to its impact on writers and photographers <e>", "<cs> my lords i want only to ask the noble lord if he can tell us whether a word has been left out at the end of the first line of subsection <e> <s> i believe that the word unless should be inserted there <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friends in this amendment largely because in the course of the bill we realise that copyright does not subsist if a work is a copy <e> <s> therefore the word original here is certainly unnecessary and possibly otiose <e> <s> i do not see why it should be thought necessary to include the word original in paragraph a but not at the beginning of paragraphs b and c <e> <s> it appears to me that if it stays in then it should be included in those other paragraphs <e>", "<cs> perhaps it also means spoken or intended to be spoken <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> of course <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however can the noble lord give me an inkling of what the word should be if not but <e> <s> is it likely to be and <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has made the point perhaps i may add that i too feel accordingly is unnecessary here <e> <s> it is much better that the word should be omitted <e> <s> perhaps the minister will look at that point <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i turn first to the noble lord lord somers and his comment on the spelling in my amendment as in the bill of the word program <e> <s> i raised this matter some months ago in your lordships house <e> <s> i said on that occasion that it was wrongly spelt and that it should have me at the end <e> <s> it was pointed out to me that a computer program in contrast to a theatre programme is spelt that way <e> <s> that is the usage that has arisen in this country following its usage in the united states <e> <s> i accepted that that was the case <e> <s> i therefore used the spelling that has been handed down and that is found in other bills <e>", "<cs> i am well accustomed to ministers defending their draftsmen <e> <s> i do not for a moment expect to be able to budge the minister in that opinion or indeed to muster overwhelmining support although i have received one or two encouraging nods and winks from different parts of the chamber <e> <s> i suppose that i shall have to withdraw the amendment although i feel more inclined to sit down and say content rather softly <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said however i do not intend to take it any further <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise a couple of points <e> <s> the first was mentioned earlier in the debate <e> <s> for some strange reason there is no definition of dramatic work <e> <s> both literary work and musical work are defined <e> <s> in the case of a dramatic work we are told merely that it <e>", "<cs> i cannot see any reason at all for including those words <e> <s> the committee has just been told that literary work means any work and does not have to be told further irrespective of its literary merit <e> <s> if it were said as could be said of a second-rate literary work that it is a mere scribble that would not stop it from being a literary work because it is so irrespective of literary merit <e> <s> similarly one does not have to be told that a dramatic or musical work is irrespective of merit <e>", "<cs> i have been worried about the points raised by the noble lord lord broxbourne and i am glad that once again we have an expert in the committee who can tell us exactly what is meant by engravings etchings and so on <e>", "<cs> can the minister explain why paragraph b is necessary at all <e> <s> we read in paragraph a that a sound recording means a recording of sounds <e> <s> the subsection continues <e>", "<cs> i raised this point on second reading <e> <s> i do not like at all this reference to something being merely semantic <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord is not being anti-semantic <e> <s> i happen to believe that there is no particular reason why a bill should not be written in reasonably good english <e> <s> i wish other noble lords would sometimes join me in putting down semantic amendments <e>

said mere semantics <e>", "<cs> i had no idea that i was breaking the law by listening to the world service which i do quite frequently <e> <s> i am not sure why that should be illegal <e>", "<cs> this is not a context in which the verb to access would be used <e> <s> it is used when working with computers <e> <s> the minister has been extremely good in dealing with all the points that arose from members of the committee <e> <s> however it seemed to me that he did not give a proper reply to amendments nos <e> <s> and put forward by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i must point out that accessible by is the passive term and accessible to is active <e>", "<cs> is the reason the draftsmans words are better that they are the draftsmans words <e>", "<cs> i must say that i cannot understand the noble lords argument <e> <s> i began by pointing out that under the definition at the beginning of clause broadcast means the transmission <e> <s> that is the definition <e> <s> they are the same thing <e> <s> broadcast means the transmission <e> <s> therefore there cannot be a distinction between them <e>", "<cs> i am completely unconvinced but i do not think i shall divide the committee <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that drawings photographs and other illustrations are all part of the layout <e>", "<cs> there seem to be two separate stages involved according to whether it is words or illustrations <e> <s> if it is words the copyright in the words resides with the author <e> <s> this concerns the way in which the typeface and layout are used <e> <s> it is quite separate in regard to the typography <e> <s> a different copyright resides in the typography <e> <s> the same applies in the case of illustrations <e> <s> there is only one copyright in the illustration and it belongs to the person who makes the drawing <e> <s> that also forms part of the layout and as such comes under the copyright regarding the typography <e> <s> the two are separate <e>", "<cs> no that is not so <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted subsection would say <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down let me say that when i referred in my remarks to the exposure of the emulsion to light and so on <e> <s> i was giving what was probably an inaccurate or inadequate version of what happened <e> <s> those words would not appear on the bill <e> <s> all that appears in the bill is that the photographer creates the photograph <e>", "<cs> that is precisely the point that i was going to make <e> <s> my amendment does not say that the creator is the person who pressed the button as it seems to be thought <e> <s> it says that the creator is the photographer <e> <s> therefore it has to be decided if there is any doubt about it who in any particular case is the photographer <e> <s> in a case such as this where there is an assistant who exposes the film that does not affect the fact that the photographer is the creator <e>", "<cs> i do not agree <e> <s> i do not believe that it does apply to other authors <e> <s> for example in the case of a writer it is perfectly clear that the author is the person who produces that manuscript <e> <s> that is what the copyright is for <e> <s> with a photograph <e> <s> it is not per cent <e> <s> clear i believe it should be <e> <s> i appreciate the support i have received from other members of the committee <e> <s> i do not want meekly to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> therefore although i will not divide the committee i do not intend to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the same applies even when one is an old writer <e>", "<cs> we come to moral rights later in the bill <e> <s> it is right that the director should be given the moral right to be identified as the director and not to have his work unnecessarily adapted <e> <s> with that i agree <e> <s> i do not see that the director of a motion picture should have any automatic special right to the copyright in that motion picture <e> <s> he is hired to direct the movie <e> <s> of course his work is of immense importance <e> <s> everyone who has been on the set while a film is being made knows how important is the director <e> <s> i had the great privilege of working for two months with john houston when he was making moby dick <e> <s> i think that he made a total hash of the film but his work shone through the whole of it <e> <s> he influenced the entire making of the film <e>", "<cs> i completely support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> i cannot understand why the words <e>", "<cs> perhaps it might be of interest if i briefly gave an example from my personal experience <e> <s> for five happy years i had a contract with the london <e>", "<cs> surely the opposite of intensive is extensive <e> <s> therefore as it is now becoming fashionable i hope that we can in the future talk about extensification rather than de-intensification <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment put down by the two noble lords <e> <s> i have never understood why it should be the case that a certain length of time after an authors death other people who have had nothing to do with the creation of the work should be able to steal it <e> <s> i should like to see the time extended to years <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and am happy to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> it is the second time that he has said that he will take up one of my amendments and i am very grateful <e> <s> of course if i do not see a simple amendment on the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord brain referred to my amendment no <e> <s> when he was moving his own and my amendment cannot be moved if either of these other amendments succeeds <e> <s> that would suit me fine because i support either of them and they both seem to amount to the same thing <e> <s> my only reason for putting down amendment no <e> <s> was that in the event of neither of those amendments reaching the statute book and if the bill remains as it is it will reduce even further the period before the copyright in a photograph ends <e> <s> at present it is years from the time the photograph was published but the period from when the photograph was taken will be shorter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i was surprised to hear him say that there are many films that have not been completed <e> <s> i do not know in what sense he can say that <e> <s> if precious little work has been done on films for a number of years i should have thought it must be supposed that they were completed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i completely agree with what the noble and learned lord has said as regards serials <e> <s> however there is a point which worries me and which i mentioned in a letter i would be raising <e> <s> that is the case of a repeat broadcast <e> <s> that matter is mentioned in subsections and <e> <s> i cannot see any necessity for the two subsections <e> <s> surely there is no separate copyright in a repeat broadcast <e> <s> a broadcast has its own copyright and a repeat broadcast is covered by the same copyright <e> <s> there is no need to say that copyright expires at the same time as the copyright on the original broadcast <e> <s> it is the same copyright <e>", "<cs> i should like to study that <e> <s> i may come back to it <e>", "<cs> i was sorry when my noble friend lord williams once again announced that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> when he talks about his probing amendments we understand that he does not want them to be incorporated in the bill <e> <s> i should like to see his amendment accepted and the word substantial deleted because copyright should be infringed if far less than a substantial part of the work is published <e>", "<cs> i am normally glad to hear my noble friend lady phillips intervene in debates because i usually find myself in agreement with her <e> <s> however i was sorry that she intervened in the way she did on this occasion because i should like to assure her that the matters we are raising are matters that are of very great importance however small some of them may seem to those who are engaged in this committee <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is perhaps a little unfair in her remarks because although it may not seem important to her i think the fact that we are repeatedly raising these matters must mean that they are important to us <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for again giving me the formula to which we are becoming accustomed that he will consider the amendment improve its drafting and it is hoped see it into the statute <e> <s> of course i am perfectly happy to withdraw the amendment on that understanding <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord write similarly to other noble lords whom he has told in a rather unusual form that he is considering their amendments with sympathy <e> <s> when he said that before i suggested that it was a bit unusual <e> <s> i believe he has accepted one amendment but there have been many other occasions perhaps a dozen when he has said that an amendment was good but that he would like to look at it <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> it deals with the word recognisable <e> <s> that may well be the word we should have been using earlier when in another context we were talking about a substantial part of the work <e> <s> what really matters is whether the part that is used is extensive enough to be recognisable as a part of that other work <e> <s> i support my noble friend and suggest that this word should be used instead of substantial in earlier passages of the bill <e>", "<cs> does that mean that any form of abridgement or digest of a work is covered in the same way <e> <s> we all know that the <e>", "<cs> in what part of the clause is that shown to be included as an adaptation <e>",

noble friends apprehension particularly on the last part of paragraph b which states <e>", "<cs> i find some difficulty in understanding exactly what the wording would be <e> <s> if the word including is included the sentence would read <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those members of the committee who have supported me on this amendment <e> <s> of course i regret that the noble and learned lord lord denning has changed his mind <e>", "<cs> if as the minister indicated fair dealing should be confined to nothing more than using a part of a photograph taken some time ago then many of the objections to the present wording would be removed <e> <s> i have personally never seen a full definition of what is meant by fair dealing <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> a problem arises here because subsection applies only to musical works whereas subsection refers to copyright works of any description <e> <s> although one can perhaps imagine a musical work being included unintentionally it is hard to imagine a literary work being included unintentionally <e> <s> that would be included if the word unintentional was substituted in clause <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak now on the next amendment amendment no <e> <s> which cannot be called if my noble friends amendment is

amendment no <e> <s> at the same time but he has not yet done so <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i asked whether the noble earl could kindly repeat what he said

simpler but it is such a tiny point that i intend to withdraw the amendment immediately <e>", "<cs> i find myself standing between two angry men an academic and an author <e> <s> i wish to point out

opinion it is only on such land that the planting of trees is a profitable operation <e> <s> if trees are planted on arable or improved ground the loss of agricultural income from those areas during

<e> <s> on one word or on one line there may be points which one wishes to raise and other points on words which come immediately afterwards <e> <s> that is what both the noble lord <e> <s> lord henderson and my noble friends have done in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i must say that i am extremely disappointed by the reply from the noble earl <e> <s> to begin with we have been told that pretended here is used in some mediaeval sense to mean claimed <e> <s> why do we have to use a word in its mediaeval sense <e> <s> when we talk about pretending we do not mean claimed <e> <s> we all know what is meant by it as the noble lord lord airedale has indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords we have got on to family now <e> <s> we left pretended behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not dream of again dividing the house on this but i should like to point out one matter to the noble earl <e> <s> if two of my amendments are accepted then what a local authority shall not do is promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a relationship not as a pretended family relationship but as a relationship <e> <s> does the insistence of the minister that the words pretended and family should be included mean that the acceptability of homosexuality as a relationship can <e>", "<cs> my lords we all appreciate the amount of time that the minister gave to our amendments at committee stage <e> <s> however i regret that he has taken that point of view <e> <s> i should like to point out to him that in committee i tabled a number of drafting amendments intended to improve the language of the bill <e> <s> we need only look down to amendment no <e> <s> tabled in the ministers name to find that my point about bad wording and bad drafting has been taken up and that he has tabled an amendment accordingly <e> <s> we could go on to amendments nos <e> <s> and all of which relate to proposals which i put forward and which have been taken up by the noble lord <e> <s> amendments have now been tabled along the lines i suggested in order to improve the wording <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for the length at which he has dealt with the points that i raised <e> <s> i find it a complicated matter and i find it strange that it should be essential to <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was kind enough to say that i was at least partially responsible for his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he might have gone on to say that i was almost wholly responsible for amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree to a very great extent with what my noble friend lord willis has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that in the case of a motion picture there are a number of authors or there can be considered to be a number of authors <e> <s> as my noble friend said there is the original writer who would be herman melville in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that my amendments were apparently innocuous <e> <s> after listening to his speech i must say that they may have been apparently innocuous to him but they were not so to me <e> <s> he has now had to bring forward the long series of amendments to cope with the points which i made <e> <s> i believe that that is an example of the way in which a bill can be improved not only by my amendments but by all of the or amendments which were put down concerning points which we wished to raise <e> <s> that is an example of the way in which a bill can be improved as it passes through this revising chamber before going to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving this amendment my noble friend said that he spoke at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if we are now discussing amendment no <e> <s> it means that we have to do so without having heard from the minister his reasons for wishing to delete an extremely important subsection that completely changes the emphasis of this bill for a great many journalists whether they are writers or photographers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> i am sure that it was a completely authoritative statement <e> <s> i thought that that was the position but in view of what has appeared in the press i wanted to raise the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for finding out that what i said at the committee stage was right <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for my absence <e> <s> your lordships reached this amendment rather more quickly than i had anticipated <e> <s> i understand that we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry that i missed much of what the noble lord said in speaking to this amendment <e> <s> the point that i make in amendment no <e> <s> is that it is surely not correct to talk about making a photograph of when we are <e>", "<cs> then my lords i should like to make a point on that separately <e> <s> reverting to my earlier remarks that is precisely the way in which a still photograph of great value can be made from a film or a video tape and it therefore has to be seriously considered <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord has made a proposal as a result of the point that i raised at committee stage but i think that my own language is surely preferable <e>", "<cs> my lords i was reassured by what the minister said about the definition of substantial although of course his reassurance will not be available as evidence in a court of law at any future date <e> <s> i assume that he is right that that is the legal understanding of the word <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am entitled to speak <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for his remarks <e> <s> i had to disagree last week with his drafting of an amendment to the local government bill <e> <s> therefore it is all the more appreciated that he was able to say a few words in support of my efforts on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords although i intend to withdraw the amendment i am not satisfied with what the minister said <e> <s> clause begins by stating <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments seem to have been printed out of order <e> <s> the fact that we are taking amendment no <e> <s> before amendment no <e> <s> means that if amendment no <e> <s> is approved as we must assume it will be even if we were to agree to amendment no <e> <s> it would immediately fall because it is an amendment to a passage that will be deleted by amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i cannot understand why a similar provision is not already in the bill <e> <s> clause is full of gobbledegook and i think it will contain even more gobbledegook after it is amended <e> <s> subsection will begin <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am slightly disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage i put down an amendment which sought to define a photographer <e> <s> i did not take part in the debate on the amendment of the noble lord which put in the new definition of photograph <e> <s> however i considered carefully his revised version today and again read the debate that took place on that occasion <e> <s> i regret to say that i do not share the enthusiasm of the noble lord lord brain <e> <s> in my opinion the version in the bill at present is not acceptable although if anything it is slightly more so than the new version proposed by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he explain <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord explain how a print <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am asking him how it is possible for a negative to be a copy of a print when by definition what is black in a negative is white in a print and vice versa <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether it is perfectly safe to use the bars in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the noble lord lord thomas who drew attention to the fact that my noble friends motion calls attention to the continuing conflict in the singular in the middle east although as he pointed out there are many conflicts in that area <e> <s> neither he nor any of the subsequent speakers have referred to any of those conflicts although the fighting in the so-called gulf war the iraq-iran war is far more serious in terms of human suffering and loss of life than any other in the area <e>", "<cs> i generally welcome the thinking behind the amendment put down by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> however i should like to make one or two remarks about the wording <e> <s> first in paragraph a i do not know why we have to say that <e>", "<cs> i quite see the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps the details could be given further thought <e> <s> the wording refers to the child who has disconnected its own seat belt <e> <s> incidentally i think it should be his seat belt because the child is not neuter <e> <s> the usual well-worn clich is that the male embraces the female and that the word he includes the word she whatever the feminists may have to say about it <e> <s> however if that wording goes into the act it will mean that when little tommy says oh daddy i dont want to wear my seat belt daddy can say oh thats all right darling i will <e>", "<cs> this is precisely the matter to which i drew attention when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> certainly i cannot agree with this proposal <e> <s> the english langauge does not have a great many shortcomings but one deficiency is that there is no pronoun that can refer to a person whether male or female <e> <s> the only possible course is to use he or she or him or her every time or else as is the convention simply to use the masculine form and say him <e> <s> it is not very popular with some of our feminist friends but it is the general practice <e> <s> as i said earlier it is always understood that the male embraces the female and the use of the male pronoun includes the female <e> <s> therefore i oppose the proposal of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause i and despite the entry into the chamber of the two chief whips i should like to draw attention to two matters that have arisen in the course of the debate <e> <s> the first is that considerable doubt has been cast by the noble lord lord nugent and others upon allegations by the noble lord lord monson among others that seat belts can be a great danger to people who are trapped in cars and are burnt to death or drowned <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out that the noble lord lord brabazon foresaw the possibility of there being more children than seat belts <e> <s> he was asked what would happen if more children were in his own car than there were seat belts <e> <s> from memory he replied that whoever gets into the car first would wear the seat belts <e>", "<cs> in spite of what my noble friend has said to the committee i think we have to consider my amendment no <e> <s> at this stage because on my reading of it if amendment no <e> <s> were agreed i would not be able to move my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl aware that as i said the humble mule is also included in all reference to equine species in the act <e> <s> it should therefore surely be included in any future amending legislation <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend wants the bill to embrace the mule there is no palaver necessary at all <e> <s> the committee simply has to accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when we reach report i expect to be somewhere in the wilds of the middle east and unable to table an amendment <e> <s> however as it has been requested by my noble friend i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> this will make amendments nos <e> <s> and superfluous which i shall not move <e>", "<cs> on clause stand part i want to say that i share the feelings of sympathy towards travelling people which have been expressed by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> but i cannot see how there can be any feelings of apprehension that under this legislation the tethering of any horse would <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether any decision has been made on the proposals to give transport grants for taking the timber to markets in the north and west of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment if only for the reason that in the bill as at present drafted if any person does not want the children in the back to be using their seat belts all he has to do is to remove them from the back of the car <e>", "<cs> asses and mules <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad that my noble friend has agreed with the point i made in committee that the mule should be embraced by the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl lord arran was in fact playing the part of esau in drafting the wording of the amendment as was suggested by my noble friend because i should point out that the effect of the amendment is precisely the same as if my amendment had been accepted in committee <e> <s> so perhaps the mantle of esau should more properly fall upon myself <e> <s> however i am glad to see the mule included as he certainly should be and of course i support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount referred to british colonial africa <e> <s> does the noble earl know where that is <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a reference by the noble viscount lord buckmaster to british colonial africa <e> <s> i was just asking where that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the scheme and thank the noble baroness for her exposition of it <e> <s> the principles are absolutely right and the grants are reasonably generous <e> <s> however there are one or two details to which i should like to draw attention for a moment particularly in schedule which sets out the categories of the converted woodlands <e> <s> category is the most favoured of them <e> <s> those woodlands can receive up to per hectare for a maximum of years but they have to be almost pure pedunculate or sessile oak or european beech though there may be per cent <e> <s> of other species growing among them <e> <s> it is a pity that particular broadleaf trees have been specified <e> <s> although both the oaks and the european beech are noble and valuable trees which take a long time to reach maturity others are just as desirable in particular the ash which i think is not only very beautiful but is perhaps the most or possibly the only profitable broadleaf tree to grow the sycamore the spanish chestnut the southern beech and so on <e> <s> i do not know why these other broadleaf species should be discriminated against particularly when the land in question is a little wet or has the wrong characteristics and may not be at all suitable for the species listed in category <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord perhaps thought when he gets his grant of investing that himself for compound interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my noble friend meant to say without opening the jaws rather than without opening the mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend in his amendments and if he were to press them to a vote i would gladly follow him into the division lobby <e> <s> there are two matters one of which has been alluded to already on which i feel that some clarification is necessary and i hope it may be possible for the minister or for my noble friend to give it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> he said that dna analysis is possible on the basis of perhaps a dozen hairs particularly if they are removed by the roots <e> <s> under paragraph a of the proposed commons amendment a sample of hair other than pubic hair constitutes a non-intimate sample <e> <s> if that sample can identify a person genetically surely it should not be a non-intimate sample <e> <s> there is no need to take swabs from the mouth if one just has to take out a dozen hairs of the head <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned gas attacks by the iraqis on the iranian forces but he must be aware of the much more serious attacks on the kurdish people of iraq who are iraqi citizens <e> <s> have received an eye witness report from the refugee camps in turkey <e> <s> are the government taking serious note of the extremely bad conditions under which the kurdish refugees from iraq gas attacks are being held <e> <s> will they take every possible step to alleviate them by ensuring in this order of priority the supply of blankets medical equipment and food <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend looks at the top of page i think that he will see there the definition of dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords the exclusion of photographs in this clause was a point that i raised during the passage of the bill through your lordships house <e> <s> i am glad to see that the commons has seen the wisdom of my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for having initiated this debate <e> <s> i am not going to try to match the tour <e>", "<cs> this raises an important question upon which i should like to speak for a moment or two <e> <s> i remember when i was a ward of court not so long ago as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale mentioned namely at the beginning of the century but to years ago when i was or <e> <s> the judge on any important occasion wanted to know what i wanted <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge on every occasion he made an order in accordance with what i had asked <e> <s> i found that an admirable arrangement <e> <s> i must say that neither of my parents ever tried to influence me in any way <e> <s> i was brought straight from school to the judges chambers <e> <s> however that situation does not always apply in the case of every parent <e>", "<cs> i profoundly agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in view of that perhaps i may again draw from my personal experience and say that throughout my childhood from the age of about six or seven what i wanted most in life was that my parents should be together again <e> <s> that was not possible <e> <s> instead i and my siblings there were three of us spent exactly equal periods of time each and every holiday from our boarding schools with each parent calculated down to the last day or half child day <e> <s> our parents each had their own home which we regarded as our own <e> <s> we loved them equally <e> <s> i often feel that it would be so much better if children of ruined marriages today could have similar arrangements <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may look ahead for a moment to the amendments tabled in my name namely amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i put the amendments forward because i had not fully realised <e>", "<cs> i wish to express agreement if i may with much of what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has just said <e> <s> i too was not at all happy about the word paramount being used simply on its own <e> <s> i wonder whether i might also draw the attention of the committee to the word upbringing in clause a <e> <s> i am not at all certain that that word includes many of the matters that the court will have to consider <e> <s> i do not think that the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> it is the case that the welfare of each child must be considered separately <e> <s> the children may be different and what is best for one child may not be best for the other <e> <s> therefore the wording of clause is correct in that the welfare of each child in turn shall be the courts paramount consideration for that child <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord and other noble lords who rather broadened my little amendment beyond the area that i expected it to cover <e> <s> of course i shall withdraw the amendment but before doing so i should like to refer to what the noble lord lord renton said about the definition of the word parent <e> <s> i agree that it is far from clear what that word means <e> <s> he spoke of some previous statute in which the word father was defined or he thought it was <e> <s> i wonder whether by any chance he is thinking of the definition of that word which i put down as an amendment to the family law reform bill <e> <s> i thought that it was necessary on that occasion as i do now to say what is meant by the word father or mother because it seems to be used to mean something quite different in one section as opposed to another section <e>", "<cs> my lords it had not occurred to me that nanny nursemaids baby sitters and child minders should have parental responsibility <e> <s> all these people who take over work which parents are unable or unwilling to do are very useful if either parent or both want to go to a pub for a drink <e> <s> however they can never be said to have parental responsibility and i do not think that any reference to them is intended here <e>", "<cs> i should like to refer to what was said by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> she spoke <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that if i were to put my child under the care of someone i would say you are responsible for him while i am away <e> <s> i would make that person responsible and that person would assume responsibility <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his consideration <e> <s> i accept entirely what he says and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the advice given to me by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it comes to me from an eminent source without my having to pay any legal fees <e> <s> of course before that could happen i would have to obtain a residence order <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am glad that he is going to consider this again <e> <s> i feel that it is a matter that needs further consideration because it is very difficult to draft a subsection which is applicable to both subsections and <e> <s> the suggestion has been made both by the noble lady lady saltoun of abernethy and the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for putting the words at the death of <e>", "<cs> if i may avail myself of this opportunity i should like to say that during the dinner break i saw a solution to my personal problem which i mentioned on the previous amendment <e> <s> that is that i should die before royal assent <e>", "<cs> in subsection we are told that <e>", "<cs> i must say that i completely agree with the noble lord lord meston and do not see the necessity for my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the clause states that <e>", "<cs> the necessity for the amendment seems to depend upon the meaning of the word visit <e> <s> the word means different things to different people <e> <s> our american cousins when they talk about visiting someone or abominably visiting with someone mean little <e> <s> for instance a lady will come to ones table and say may i visit with you for a few <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to know that that will be on the record although of course what is said in your lordships committees on the record is in fact never remembered and never brought up again in any court <e> <s> but all the same i am satisfied by the noble and learned lords assurance that the singular includes the plural <e> <s> therefore i wish to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> in any case i feel that the categories included by paragraphs a and b are not wide enough <e> <s> i think that any parent who has parental responsibility for a child should be entitled to apply to the court for an order under clause <e> <s> that is not automatically possible at present it is only a parent a guardian or a person in whose favour a residence order has been made <e> <s> whether or not it is made as wide as the noble lord lord meston would like i think that it should he widened <e>", "<cs> in that case i suggest it would be far easier if subsections and were transposed <e>", "<cs> despite his criticism i appreciate the words of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> perhaps i may say that he is mistaken in thinking that it is the sole duty of the sub-editor to shorten copy <e> <s> on the contrary quite often it is <e>", "<cs> i cannot possibly agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the bill as it stands refers to the application disrupting the childs life <e>", "<cs> making an application for leave does not disrupt a childs life <e> <s> it cannot possibly do so <e> <s> how can making an application disrupt a childs life <e> <s> it is not that <e> <s> it is what happens if the application is granted <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we are talking about the application itself resulting in disruption of the childs life <e> <s> an application cannot so result <e>", "<cs> if the application is successful and the order is given it may result in disruption of the childs life <e>", "<cs> it causes disruption to other people and to the parents but it does not cause disruption to the childs life <e> <s> i sense that i do not have the committee behind me on this amendment and i say that with great perspicacity <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord meston was kind enough to refer to the remarks which i made yesterday <e> <s> i accept that in the great majority of cases the arrangement in a failed marriage is that one parent usually the mother has care and control and the other parent has access <e> <s> the non-custodial parent just turns up from time to time according to what he wants and according to what the custodial parent will allow <e>", "<cs> i said father <e> <s> at present there is a residence order in favour of the father and i am saying it should be in favour of the parent of the child <e> <s> it seems to me that although in most cases the residence order will be made in the case of the mother surely when that happens and it is made in favour of the mother it is equally necessary that if she would not otherwise have parental responsibility a similar order should be made <e> <s> in subsection there is mention of <e>", "<cs> yes i am quite relieved to withdraw this amendment and not to move the next two amendments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the present definition is faulty and the amendment does not cure that <e> <s> it sates that disabled means a child who is blind <e> <s> that is not what disabled means <e> <s> the wording is therefore mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that it is easy to tell the sex of a pelican because either the male is bigger than the female or the female is bigger than the male <e> <s> i cannot remember which <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the recruitment of young fishers of almost equal importance <e>", "<cs> i remember the discussions that i had with the noble and learned lord on this subject when we were dealing with the family law reform bill and even more the discussions that i had with his noble and learned predecessor the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> nonetheless i find it remarkable that it is necessary in the same bill to have two subsections that say exactly the same thing <e> <s> if something is important does that mean that we have to say it twice or perhaps three times <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand why and am sorry that amendment no <e> <s> has not been moved because from the purely grammatical point of view it would have been better than amendments nos <e> <s> and as the word only should always govern the word or phrase which appears immediately after it <e> <s> but if it has been withdrawn this is certainly an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for tabling these three amendments that deal very successfully with the points that i raised at the committee stage <e> <s> there is one little exception <e> <s> it seems that a further drafting amendment is necessary in the form of the amendment standing in my name as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be for the convenience

although lawyers and members of the legal profession know all about the interpretation act and know at once that singular will include plural that is far from being the case for laymen <e> <s> i have discussed the bill with a number of such laymen and they had the definite impression from reading the definition that because of the wording it would be possible to give a residence order only in respect of one parent <e> <s> i had to explain the interpretation act and so on <e> <s> although i withdraw the amendment i am glad to have drawn attention to i he point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell us what constitutes a racial group and in particular whether the irish constitute a racial group <e> <s> i ask that on the eve of st patricks day <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree completely with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i also feel that if it was thought necessary to say that a child was in need and the parent or parents happened to be disabled the social worker could simply say yes that is true but the fact that he or she is disabled has nothing to do with this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggested that at this stage i would speak to amendment no <e> <s> and then come to nos <e> <s> and separately <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord resumes his seat may i ask whether

another place <e> <s> since this is the only opportunity that he will have to reply may i further ask him whether he cannot at this stage deal with amendment no <e> <s> which is simply a drafting matter without dealing with the others that i have not yet moved <e>", "<cs> my lords there are important points that arise on amendments nos <e> <s> and which i shall raise and which may be of interest to other noble lords <e> <s> i should like to refer to them briefly when the time comes <e> <s> on the question of amendment no <e> <s> i should first like to say how much i appreciate the support that was expressed from all parts of the house for what i said <e> <s> i really do not believe that my proposal can be opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lady lady kinloss for her support <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble and learned lord for saying that he will reconsider the definition and that later presumably in another place the matter will come up again <e> <s> in view of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as amendment no <e> <s> has been accepted it does not seem sense to agree to amendment no <e> <s> in fact it will rot be possible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is not too much of an intrusion for one who is not a welshman to intervene on this occasion <e> <s> however my noble friend has so often risen from that bench a couple of rows in front of me to plead eloquently in the interests of my own country ireland that i wish to rise briefly to support him when for once he is raising a matter of such importance to his own country wales which is also part of the celtic fringe <e> <s> this is perhaps the more appropriate because the question of a national language is much involved and the languages of our two countries though quite distinct and not at all as similar as those of ireland and scotland are related <e> <s> both spring from the same fount although i had better not go into that now <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the present threat to qala diza and rania is no more than a continuation of a systematic policy involving the movement of kurds to other areas the south of the country is not mentioned in the question and their transfer into what are no more than concentration camps <e> <s> has that not been happening for at least the past seven or eight years <e> <s> i can confirm that having seen it myself when i was in the area in <e> <s> is this not all part of a systematic programme of genocide under the definition provided by the united nations of the kurdish people and should it not be raised by the government in the united nations <e> <s> should we not take every action to bring it to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords the ambassador said that journalists would be welcome to visit the south of the country to see that nothing of this kind is going on <e> <s> is it not a fact that the south of the country is nowhere specified in the question <e> <s> it is now believed that this is going on not in the south of the country but in other parts of kurdistan <e> <s> will the ambassador agree to me or to other journalists going to the qala diza and rania areas <e> <s> if so i should be delighted to take him up on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> will he agree that under the treaty to which the british empire as it then existed france and italy were principal signatories turkey agreed that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the earlier sentence is to which the minister referred in the treaty of lausanne but could i direct his attention to another earlier sentence in article <e> <s> it states that turkey undertakes that the stipulations contained in the article that i quoted shall be recognised as fundamental laws and that no law regulation or official action shall conflict or interfere with those stipulations <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that the sufferings of the kurdish people especially in iraq and turkey are among those to which the government are giving particular attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> does he agree that the definition of genocide in the convention is extremely wide <e> <s> it is the killing <e>", "<cs> my lords can it be the case and apparently it is that the foreign office did not receive a copy of the fax sent to <e>", "<cs> my lords the fax was received from the iraqi embassy in london <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord so completely out of touch with reality that he imagines having to pay for a sight test will not discourage millions of ordinary men and women from having their eyes looked at <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend or the noble lord lord mottistone speak again perhaps i may be allowed to voice my objection to the use of the word community to which the minister referred when speaking to the last amendment <e> <s> the word community is contained in clause <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting that the minister is in any way disparaging any people in the community <e> <s> i am saying that he is calling them different communities <e> <s> i say that they are members of the same community and should be recognised as being members of the same community <e> <s> there is no question of disparagement about it <e> <s> to use the word community in that sense is most unfortunate <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to the noble lord lord mottistone with the very greatest respect that it really is not the case that it is possible to tell somebodys religion either by their name or by their address <e> <s> of course in general terms catholics do tend to have irish or celtic names but that is very far from being a rule <e> <s> one finds the most ardent catholics the most ardent nationalists with names like nixon or young or walker simply because at some stage their grandfather or their grandmother married a catholic <e> <s> they may have been brought up as catholics but they still have completely english names <e> <s> that is the position so far as the names are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot understand the noble lords argument <e> <s> he seems to have completely missed the point of what i said <e> <s> as a matter of fact i do not care at all what is in the act and i do not see its relevance <e> <s> i used the word pleonastic to which the noble lord drew attention which simply means that this is a pleonasm in other words that the phrase is completely unnecessary because it has already been stated <e> <s> for some reason or other the draftsman has decided to define equality of opportunity twice over once in clause and again in clause <e> <s> both are identical <e> <s> i do not see any reason for repeating the definition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to say that i mentioned at committee stage that it is not possible to tell a persons persuasion from their address <e> <s> in many cases it will be possible but in many others it will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his words <e> <s> he always shows a great understanding of the problems involved <e> <s> the irony always strikes me of him being a minister in belfast when he is himself a member of the roman catholic faith <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for his words about regulations <e> <s> i am glad to know that those regulations will be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to be having some difficulty in getting my thoughts across to the minister <e> <s> of course that is entirely my fault <e> <s> i have found the reference for which i was looking <e> <s> it comes in clause ai where we talk about <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that a great many landowners and environmentalists including myself do not find that conifers constitute a blot on the landscape especially if they are imaginatively planted so as to avoid monoculture <e> <s> will he also agree that conifers are probably the only species which in the end are economically profitable apart from unusual hard woods such as cricket bat willows <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that there are no endangered species on the list in schedule of the act which could possibly be considered as pests <e> <s> does he further accept that much concern is felt not only for species on that list but for all other species protected under the act because the act is not being enforced as rigorously as it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join both noble lords in expressing the appreciation we all felt for the great consideration and courtesy which was always shown to us by the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> i should also like to welcome the noble lord lord skelmersdale to what may be described as a hot seat <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may take the question of the saliva test a little further as it is not unimportant <e> <s> if i am wrong in thinking that saliva could be used for the purposes of dna analysis perhaps i may ask for what purposes the saliva samples will be used <e> <s> surely they could be compared only with other samples of saliva <e> <s> surely it must seldom happen that someone leaves a sample of saliva at the scene of a crime which would then have to be taken and compared with the saliva taken in the course of a test <e> <s> the noble lord said that he had looked up the question of dna analysis yesterday but if he does not have the answer and there is not sufficient time to obtain it i hope that he will write to me because i am rather mystified as to what the samples will be used for <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the persecution of the kurdish people including the use of poison gas certainly constitutes genocide as defined by the united nations <e> <s> therefore would it not be preferable for the government to impose trade sanctions upon iraq instead of extending credits to that bankrupt dictatorship <e>", "<cs> i am glad to know that the noble and learned lord does not believe that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> i know that if any member of the committee other than a minister tables an amendment he is often told that it is deficient because although it is clear what he means it is not absolutely exact down to the last sentence and syllable <e> <s> it seems to me that the wording on this occasion is not exact because in clause it simply is not stated as it has to be in clause that the embryo is a non-human embryo <e> <s> however in view of what the noble and learned lord said i do not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i shall also be very interested to here what the noble baroness lady elles will say on the next amendment <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord could tell me when he comes to reply exactly what he sees as being covered by the phrase carrying children because it does not normally include either conception or childbirth although we have been talking as though bearing children is included in the phrase <e> <s> surely that is something quite different <e>", "<cs> for my part i never imagined that anyone would even consider the possibility of putting a dead embryo or gamete into a womans <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will comment on the important point raised by the noble earl lord cork and orrery <e> <s> surely in <e>", "<cs> an unmarried couple would still be able to make use of aid or aih <e>", "<cs> no not aih <e>", "<cs> as i read this bill i see that it says that <e>", "<cs> i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> however i am not convinced by what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> he pointed out that the appearance of the primitive streak may occur earlier than days <e> <s> indeed that may be so <e> <s> but the point is that it does not matter whether it occurs earlier than days <e> <s> it does not matter if it occurs after or days <e> <s> i say that because for the purposes of the bill if we look at subsection it simply states <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i completely agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that the wording she has proposed is greatly preferable <e> <s> however there is another point which i should like to draw to the noble and learned lords attention <e> <s> regardless of whether the noble baronesss amendment is accepted or the present text remains it is not possible to place an embryo in a species <e> <s> that applies to both drafts <e> <s> so far as i am aware the embryo is placed in the womb of a member of a species <e> <s> therefore to talk about placing an embryo in a species is if i may say so nonsensical <e>", "<cs> my noble kinsman lord halsbury is almost always right <e> <s> however if he is right on this occasion i wonder whether he can explain paragraph of schedule which reads <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble and learned lord found that my proposal was only superficially attractive <e> <s> i thought that it was perfectly attractive <e> <s> any other cell clearly includes all the cells already enumerated in the bill <e> <s> however if for those obscure legal reasons the wording that he already has is indispensable i shall of course beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there seems to be this extraordinary opinion that if a child is born to a married couple he will automatically be brought up in conditions of perfect stability and happiness <e> <s> that is an absolute fantasy <e> <s> life is simply not like that at all <e> <s> it was not like that for me in my childhood and unfortunately it was not like that for my children in their childhood <e> <s> if it was suggested that couples must enter into a contract that the children should be brought up against a stable background i wonder how many married parents would be prepared to sign a contract of that kind <e>", "<cs> quite independently of the noble earl and the noble duke i reached the conclusion that it was completely wrong that the gametes of humans and animals should be mixed under any circumstances under licence <e> <s> i too therefore put down an identical amendment to amendment no <e> <s> and proposed instead the prohibition set out in amendment no <e> <s> which in the case of the noble earl and the noble duke is contained in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the word only is one that frequently becomes misplaced under strict grammatical rules <e> <s> the amendment of the noble and learned lord goes some way towards placing it in the right position <e> <s> it is certainly an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is putting the word only after proceedings in line <e> <s> i am suggesting that it should come after the word cases at the end of line <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the treatment of the kurds in iraq has amounted to an extremely serious case of genocide and in turkey is a blatant violation of the lausanne treaty to which britain was a principal signatory <e> <s> if so will the government initiate appropriate action <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord comment on the situation in turkey to which i referred <e> <s> the treatment of the kurds there violates the lausanne treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord said that he was going to speak to amendment no <e> <s> when speaking to the amendment now under discussion <e> <s> i have a couple of queries to which the noble and learned lord may wish to give his attention <e> <s> i wonder how this amendment will affect the meaning of mother and father referred to on page of the bill in clauses and <e> <s> in clause there is reference to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will allow me to ask him again if it is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord lord walton two questions <e> <s> is an oocyte exactly the same thing as an egg and if so why should he not say so <e> <s> if it is inserted in the womb as i suppose it is should it not be <e>", "<cs> my lords i had therefore better speak now <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord about the desirability of the amendment <e> <s> i am concerned with a different point but if my amendment were accepted it would have the effect of deleting the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> at a later stage i should like to see a further amendment which would embody the amendment that he has moved and what i would have moved in amendment no <e> <s> which is on a different point <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly wish to study what the noble and learned lord said and i am grateful for the way in which he has as always considered the matter <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to my use of the latin tag <e> <s> i began by expressing it in english and i thought that a latin phrase might be familiar to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to the amendment i should like to refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and standing in my name although those are not officially grouped with amendment no <e> <s> b while reserving the right to mention them again if the amendment is not approved and they can be called <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment but perhaps the noble and learned lord will explain exactly why paragraph b is necessary <e> <s> it seems to me that if the mans own sperm is used that is all the more reason to treat him as the father instead of his being disqualified by that paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i realise that he may not have completed consideration of the amendment i tabled on report <e> <s> however this is the last opportunity i have of suggesting this development <e> <s> therefore while i have no intention of pressing the amendment in any way i hope that this additional point will receive consideration for inclusion perhaps in another place <e> <s> in the light of the undertaking that the noble and learned lord has so kindly given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> or girl <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a couple of points about which i am afraid i have not warned the noble baroness because i have only just noticed them <e> <s> first i am not sure whether she means to leave out the word any in line which she is doing <e> <s> she did not refer to that change in her remarks <e> <s> as proposed the passage would read horse includes pony mule which is not the usual wording of such a clause <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot the weed be eliminated just as competently without using any chemicals by cutting it two or three times every year for two or three years <e>"]
