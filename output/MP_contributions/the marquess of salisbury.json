["<cs> my lords may i first add my congratulations to the noble lord lord carver on what we all agree was a notable contribution to our discussion and add my hopes to those of previous speakers that we shall have the opportunity of hearing him on numerous occasions in the future <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord who has just spoken will allow me not to follow what he has said <e> <s> i want to speak exclusively on the proposition put forward by the noble lord lord paget of northampton <e> <s> in view of the number of speakers i shall try to be as brief as i can and i will not follow up the detail of the noble lords argument and his very impressive report on the conduct of the elections in rhodesia <e> <s> he and others who have also been there will be covering this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is perfectly correct but i do not see that is any cause for concern with a majority of africans in control and i would not have thought that any minority would wish to have a confrontation but the noble lord may have a different view and i am not in a position to look that far into the future <e> <s> so far as white representation is concerned there are these two reasons first the one i have mentioned the need for support for the emergent administration <e> <s> they are new to these responsibilities they have to cover a very sophisticated economy and they have to provide food not only for themselves at the moment but for some of their less fortunate neighbours <e> <s> at the present time if my figures are correct i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the situation is governed by the act of dealing with it <e> <s> presumably what parliament has done it can undo <e> <s> it is perfectly possible to give immunity <e> <s> it has been done in the past and in fact i believe there is a case going on at the moment where this has happened <e> <s> surely it is perfectly open to parliament to take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard the position and to guarantee the future of those concerned if it should be necessary <e> <s> i hope in conclusion that we shall be able to take urgent steps to try to resolve this situation which has bedevilled us for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble lord lord chitnis i should like to refer to one or two aspects of the remarks that he has just made <e> <s> first he has suggested that the constitution is an unreasonable one <e> <s> i do not want to go into the matter at great length because i spoke about it when we last had a discussion on this subject <e> <s> however as both he and the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts have raised this issue i should like to point out the other side of the egalitarian aspect that they have put forward <e> <s> it is based on the assumption that when one starts taking over authority one needs to gain experience <e> <s> that is the principle which has governed all our attempts to hand over quietly our colonial countries to rulers of their own choice <e> <s> i see no reason why rhodesia should be any exception to it <e> <s> indeed the noble viscount lord boyd of merton has already pointed out that the bishop himself has said that they have seen the mistakes made by other countries and do not intend to make them themselves <e>", "<cs> i think everyone has had their say and it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester supported by the noble earl lord gowrie suggested that it would be a mistake to drive the closed shop underground <e> <s> there may be a very good case for it as it seems to me that this is a matter of tactics <e> <s> at the same time i think one should bear in mind that there is a danger in strengthening the position of the closed shop by giving it the full support of the law <e> <s> it is a matter of which method is likely to achieve the result that both he and i are agreed we desire to obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to begin by offering my most sincere and hearty congratulations to the two maiden speakers who have addressed us for the first time tonight <e> <s> we all very much enjoyed what they had to say the robust common sense of the noble duke and the historical information that was afforded us by the noble lord lord dacre of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel qualified to follow the noble lord lord soper on the moral issues involved in pacifism and armaments races but i must say that i would feel much <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord paget on that distinguished speech which was delivered with his customary skill <e> <s> i agreed very much with the general tenor of his remarks <e> <s> it has been a well worthwhile exercise on his part to raise this subject after the panorama programme which received such wide publicity had raised the points with which he dealt <e> <s> this subject has been raised many times before <e> <s> there have been hints in various aspects of the media about it but there had been no definite contribution to prove what had been going on until the panorama programme was produced <e>", "<cs> my lords before i say anything more i must declare an interest in a matter connected with this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans has suggested that this is a fairly modest bill regularising some of the anomalies of the act and that it really does not go very far beyond that <e> <s> the question is whether one agrees with the act and whether one agrees with his proposals <e> <s> with some of the proposals i have a great deal of sympathy <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned that people want to own their own houses <e> <s> that is something which i entirely go along with as a general principle although a little later i should like to draw attention to some problems connected with it <e> <s> the noble lord also said that he thought that people needed this protection <e> <s> i am sure they did but i was under the impression as i think was the noble earl lord kinnoull that the protection is now already there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord paget for raising this rather depressing matter and i would like to congratulate him on the way he has presented his case <e> <s> it is indeed a formidable one and one that deserves the widest possible publicity <e> <s> he has covered most of the aspects of the subject matter and i do not want to go over the same ground again but there are one or two points which he made that i would like to emphasise and one or two further questions i would like to ask <e> <s> first may i ask something about the formulation of the constitution <e> <s> i hope that just for information the minister will be able to tell me what the position is <e> <s> the noble lord lord carrington when he opened the lancaster house conference said <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment having had some experience of a similar case one already mentioned by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> in that instance a family was deliberately broken up as a result of administrative action although there appeared to be no real reason for assuming that the parents were incapable of looking after the children <e> <s> in fact the mother was a state registered nurse <e> <s> i think that they were misled as has been pointed out by the noble lord who has just spoken and did not understand the position <e> <s> the case was taken up by two local magistrates who told me that they considered that it was a gross miscarriage of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords before saying anything i think i should declare an interest in the matter under discussion <e> <s> the noble lord lord rugby started his speech by saying that the problem we faced was largely a question of balance <e> <s> this is very <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain your lordships for long at this late hour but there are one or two comments that i should like to make <e> <s> i put down my objection for two reasons first because i did not think that the bill would achieve the object that it set out to do that of creating more tenancies but rather the reverse <e> <s> secondly i did not like the proposals in this clause for the new rent formula <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble earl <e> <s> like him i must declare an interest in that i have a number of tenanted farms in my family <e> <s> i entirely agree with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the initiative of the noble lord lord paget in introducing this debate this afternoon and i entirely support his view over affairs in rhodesia or zimbabwe as it is now <e> <s> i cannot bring myself to agree with either of the two previous speakers <e> <s> in view of the grievous suffering that he experienced i should have thought that it would have been clear to my noble friend lord gridley that the only way in which to prevent a continuation of those conditions is by bringing that government or the military regime responsible for it to an end <e> <s> i do not think that the plea which the noble lord lord walston made will have any other effect than to encourage mr mugabe to continue on his present course <e> <s> if we support what mr mugabe is doing which is what i understood the noble lord to say he will think that he is perfectly entitled to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the noble lords contention that conditions in south africa are the same as they are in zimbabwe today <e> <s> quite apart from anything else the african population there have a higher standard of living than anywhere else in the world <e> <s> what i am criticising is the behaviour of the government in zimbabwe in attacking defenceless people <e> <s> i disagree entirely with him and with other speakers who have said that they were likely to cause trouble <e> <s> it seems to me that the difference in south africa is that there are dissidents who are trying to cause difficulties and disturbances against the government who are trying to maintain law and order <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy will not expect me to support his <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment i believe that the americans have sufficient nuclear power to act as a very strong deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord please repeat that <e> <s> i did not hear <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first point is concerned i thought i made my position clear <e> <s> i suggested that at this stage a two-tier system of government gave better security and ensured better treatment for the blacks than where there was complete so-called freedom to vote because that does not seem to exist <e> <s> however that does not mean to say that they are not entitled to full protection under the law in every sense of the word <e> <s> i do not have the comparable figures for education about which the noble lord lord hatch asked but when i last saw them the level of money spent was higher <e> <s> but i cannot answer for the figure of enrolments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> is she aware that there have been several previous appeals against detention but that they have all been turned down <e> <s> is she aware also that as yet there have been no charges made against the men in question although they were informed two years ago that they were about to be released <e> <s> can the noble baroness say what treatment they have received during their detention <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that these regulations were produced when there was an emergency and they have been continued when presumably no such emergency exists <e> <s> is it not an offence against human rights to continue in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune to be the first speaker to follow the noble lord lord davies on the occasion of his maiden speech <e> <s> i say this because he has given us a notable contribution to our considerations today <e> <s> he clearly has a very deep knowledge of the subjects we are discussing and he has made many useful comments which i have no doubt will be taken fully on board by the minister when he comes to reply <e> <s> i should like to add my personal congratulations to him and i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord hesketh whom i have known for a great many years <e> <s> i am delighted to see him here <e> <s> again he has made a considerable contribution to our discussions today and i hope that we shall have the pleasure of hearing many more contributions from both noble lords in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> i do not think that he will expect me to agree with everything that he has said <e> <s> my noble friend declared that an enormous number of buildings had been listed and that there had been very few objections <e> <s> however as i pointed out in moving the amendment very few people knew that there was a procedure for making an appeal <e> <s> i have no doubt that this will have had some effect <e> <s> of course my noble friend is right <e> <s> the vast majority of buildings will remain listed because there is no disagreement <e> <s> all that concerns me in respect of these amendments on listing is that the owners rights should be preserved <e> <s> i suggest that this is not the case at the moment <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the view expressed by the right reverend prelate about the problem of the faithful raising funds <e> <s> i have similar problems in my parish church which failed to secure a grant from english heritage although my noble friend lord montagu has kindly explained the reason for this <e> <s> however it is a matter that raises considerable problems <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> the fact remains that many redundant churches are on prime sites <e> <s> i can perhaps give one example of what i mean <e> <s> the church of st marys next to lambeth palace has great historical associations <e> <s> the church was made redundant and the plan was i understand to demolish it <e> <s> fortunately another use was found for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord dilhorne <e> <s> i speak also to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not intend to cover the ground covered by both noble lords who have just spoken or to repeat what i said on second reading and in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord sudeley for introducing this short debate <e> <s> if i may i should like to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle for so lucidly explaining the situation in the theological colleges and the reasons for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the terms of service in northern ireland would it not be desirable for the period of service to be reduced to what it was before <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not an excessively high figure <e> <s> does it not put an undue strain <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord cornwallis <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the last speaker said <e> <s> it seems to me that one of the reasons this procedure has been selected regardless of its impact on individuals is that it is an easy way of dealing with a complicated problem <e> <s> it enables the government to push through the legislation perhaps far quicker than under any other method of arbitration or purchase by agreement <e> <s> i do not know whether the government intend to lease the land to operators at concessionary rates or whether they are to ask the full market value but in either case it will be achieved at the expense of the original landowner <e> <s> it may be that because there are few landowners in this case her majestys government feel that they can ride roughshod over them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment <e> <s> i agree entirely with the points made by the noble lord lord cornwallis about obtaining land at a very low value for purely commercial purposes for someone elses benefit and the cause of justice which has been so ably put by the noble lord lord walston <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord shackleton and the noble earl lord longford for their kind remarks about my father <e>", "<cs> my lords much has been made in the speeches this evening of the exceptions and the benefits that will arise were those concerned given the opportunity to join the priesthood <e> <s> i wish to query whether we are advocating going down the right road <e> <s> i have always had doubts whether government by what i call exception is not in effect lowering the general standard <e> <s> i wish particularly to speak about the impact that it might have on the congregations under the ordinands <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make some comments on the results of the bill as it goes forward in its present state <e> <s> i start with an obvious remark <e> <s> without conception this bill would not have been necessary <e> <s> we spent the whole of the several days discussing it dealing with the results of conception <e> <s> indeed without conception noble lords would not be here <e>"]
