["<cs> my lords it is an honour to be here and i ask your lordships indulgence for my maiden speech <e> <s> were it not a maiden speech i should have enjoyed challenging some of the assumptions underlying the speech of the noble lord lord williams particularly the last part and i should have enjoyed crossing swords with the noble viscount lord chandos <e> <s> i am most grateful for the kind words of my noble friend lord young <e> <s> i strongly agree with the strategy both of his department and of the government that he has set out <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the endearing characteristics of the noble lord lord houghton is that whenever he exposes something that he thinks is wrong he does it very well he also generally explains that it will be very difficult if not impossible to put right <e> <s> he has put his finger on some problems and he has also very honourably shown us the difficulties of any chancellor in trying to deal with them at least summarily <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that we need many more entrepreneurs if we are to absorb the unemployed and in particular if we are to raise productivity as we hope <e>", "<cs> my lords as a newcomer i am diffident about interrupting a winding-up speech but i find it extraordinary that the noble lord imagines that the jungle is subject to competition and the law to which free enterprise is however subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is being unfair because where actions are against the law and a conviction is obtained against the perpetrators they will be sentenced accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with one comment made by the noble lord lord jenkins in his speech but not much else <e> <s> i agree sadly with him that governments in north-west europe seem to have been better governed than we have since the last war <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to intervene briefly <e> <s> is there no connection between the problems of inner cities and the previous policies of the local authorities concerned with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the noble baroness that pay price dividend and exchange controls are far more significant than those matters which she has mentioned <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord prior who of course we shall all want to hear again and again did not intend to speak when i came into the chamber today and i have not heard the whole of the debate <e> <s> however i want to pick up an assumption that the noble lord lord houghton implicitly laid before us <e> <s> he spoke as if an individual has to choose when joining a union whether his loyalty is to be to his union or to his employer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that considering the worst and the best that might have happened his statement at least gives a new chance to the management the workforce the suppliers and the dealers without future explicit risk to the taxpayer <e> <s> will he say whether output of cars per man year has improved since nationalisation <e> <s> is there scope for further improvement and among other possible results for a larger share of the market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble and gallant lord lord bramall although i naturally did not agree with all that he said <e> <s> i especially did not like being bracketed with the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> i hope that there will be ample time to discuss in committee some of the critical points that he made <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend the minister on her introduction of the bill and to say that i strongly support nearly all of its provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i have waited until the end of his philippic before noting that in the last sentence of his peroration he referred to higher education <e> <s> will he not before stigmatising the government so severely acknowledge that there are now more students in higher education than there were when the last labour government left office <e> <s> will he not acknowledge the charge of complacency that may be levelled against his whole speech a complacency that he shares with one of the opposition leaders in this house and a number of her colleagues <e> <s> let him acknowledge that even the universities in this country great though many of them are are worried by falling standards in our schools compared to what they should be <e> <s> let him acknowledge that he has been very complacent <e>", "<cs> i want with great enthusiasm what the government want in bringing forward this bill <e> <s> in fact i agree with virtually every part of the bill except that part now criticised by the noble baroness who has just spoken <e> <s> my problem is this <e> <s> if it be necessary to achieve what i and i am sure many other people want i shall have to support the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> but i should far prefer to see the government accept the group of amendments standing in my name and the names of others that is nos <e> <s> and and those amendments which come a little later in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> i apologise for interrupting her especially as we are to some extent in sympathy <e> <s> is she not unconsciously misleading the committee <e> <s> while it is true that in theory many of the subjects listed by the noble baroness lady david could be taught the secretary of state is taking power to lay down programmes of study for each of the foundation subjects <e> <s> it is extremely doubtful whether he will by a by-wind allow in all the subjects mentioned by the noble baroness lady david under the heading of history or something else <e>", "<cs> i shall keep your lordships only very briefly <e> <s> i repeat that i support the aim of the bill and nearly every part of it <e> <s> i am amazed that the important subject of the national curriculum was not discussed in another place <e> <s> to my noble friend lord beloff and the noble lord lord annan i say that the national curriculum will not meet the needs of the non-academic <e> <s> there is not enough flexibility for that unless the school week and year are substantially and significantly extended <e> <s> i believe that dilute academic subjects do not work except to bore some of the non-academic <e> <s> the french offer their non-academic pupils a totally different curriculum from which they appear to benefit <e>", "<cs> is the committee willing that i should now speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> is it improper to ask how that can be when no warning was given that amendment no <e> <s> would carry with it the elimination of a later batch of amendments <e> <s> in an earlier speech i expressed my preference for amendments nos <e> <s> and over amendment no <e> <s> when the committee divided in large numbers <e> <s> i ask the committee whether the rules involve the elimination of a group of five amendments which some of us on both sides of the committee take intensely seriously <e> <s> of course if that is the ruling of the committee i shall abide by it <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that in clause as amended in line as it now is on page the words and other foundation subjects be omitted <e>", "<cs> i am moving a manuscript amendment which i have given to the clerk <e> <s> it amends amendment no <e> <s> which has just been accepted <e> <s> i am following precisely the excellent advice given by the right reverend prelate to amend the last words of his own accepted amendment which achieves the same purpose <e>", "<cs> on a point of order will the noble lord repeat what he just said about omitting certain amendments because i did not hear <e>", "<cs> i sympathise strongly with the governments impatience to raise standards and to broaden the education of our children <e> <s> i happen to think that they have gone the wrong way about it in relation to the national curriculum <e> <s> i eagerly support the noble lord lord peston in the amendment which in effect would retain the mandatory requirement in regard to the core subjects but make the foundation subjects discretionary <e> <s> i do not think any member of the committee doubts that the foundation subjects will be taught in nearly every school <e> <s> the problem is one of flexibility <e> <s> every child is different in his or her strengths and weaknesses <e> <s> as the previous debate showed the real problem we are discussing is the pressure on time <e> <s> if of course the government were to decide to lengthen the school week or the school year that would provide a different background <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness permit me to intervene <e> <s> i am grateful to her <e> <s> i do not think that she will ever find a quotation in <e>", "<cs> the committee will realise that the case has been put and it is not possible for me to be satisfied with the answer <e> <s> i do not believe that the government are justified in imposing a legal straitjacket outside the core and i shall therefore press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the motion has led us to so many thoughtful speeches <e> <s> i am very glad that the secretary of state has listened to every one of them <e> <s> i thank all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> every speech from first to last has been significant <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to say that i do not think any such ban came from the government <e> <s> it was from the governors <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> the committee may be surprised to find that as the person notoriously responsible for introducing the gcse i rise to support my noble <e>", "<cs> not having heard this debate and therefore not having heard any previous intervention by my noble friend the minister i am reassured to learn that the secretary of state will make exemptions for what i hope will be a considerable proportion of the experimental or development works proposed <e> <s> if i have missed some previous explanation by the minister of this matter i apologise <e> <s> if she has not told the committee whether the exemptions contemplated would account for quite a proportion of the workload expected i for one would be grateful if she could add a word to what she has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will move to a decision on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i suggest that one of the ways the government could meet the requirement of the universities and broaden a-levels would be to expand the number of hours per week or weeks per year in which schools operate their studies <e> <s> we have far fewer hours per year as a requirement in education than our main european competitors and i hope that my noble friend will take that possibility into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether i shall want to support this pair of amendments but i shall listen to the minister with great care <e> <s> on the immediate issue i am sure that the secretary of state will initiate a thorough review of how gcse is working <e> <s> i doubt whether it need take as long as the noble lord lord kilmarnock fears at least in respect of this area of worry <e> <s> i am puzzled why the governors apparently forbad the teachers recommending to parents a particular syllabus that was available from scotland <e> <s> i therefore share the anxiety about their decision expressed by the noble lord lord goodman <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the debate initiated by the noble baroness lady blackstone <e> <s> i agree with her and the other speakers that our future as a society and not only as an economy depends upon an ample supply of well-educated people in the humanities and in science medicine engineering and technology <e> <s> but those subjects will not be enough unless we also have the prime movers the entrepreneurs to identify pursue and satisfy markets at home and abroad <e> <s> any industrial society depends on such skills for its jobs and its prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to intervene <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble lords propositions or suggestions could be validated or otherwise by the noble baroness lady blackstone when she comes to reply <e> <s> my suspicion is that the labour party will not abolish the a level in favour of the as level <e> <s> they propose to phase it out altogether <e> <s> i hope that we shall be reassured on the point <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak against this new clause <e> <s> i recognise that i seem to be speaking against the tide of opinion as so far expressed <e> <s> i get the impression that the committee believes that if this new clause were adopted the poorest people of whom they have spoken would get child benefit and that the child benefit would as child benefit does get paid into the hands of the mothers <e> <s> but that is an illusion <e> <s> we know that any increase in child benefit would be deducted from family credit <e> <s> i think that that is correct <e> <s> therefore the condition of the people whom the committee is most eager to help would not be improved one jot by this particular new clause <e>", "<cs> my noble friend surely meant child benefit not family benefit <e> <s> the better off are not entitled to family benefit <e> <s> i think that for once my noble friend made a mistake <e>", "<cs> my noble friend referred to another place if it so wished being able to withdraw the power of the more prosperous to draw family benefit <e> <s> however the more prosperous are not entitled to family credit <e> <s> my noble friend was surely referring to child benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will feel that in due course he will deserve the thanks of not only pub users pub tenants and pub managers but the brewers themselves large and small because they will be encouraged further to compete <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that the objections of the spokesman for her majestys opposition this afternoon to me at any rate seemed full of humbug since i ask my noble friend to remember the opposition spokesman in another place completely toed the line when seeking to protect the dock labour scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> i am grateful for the answers he has given thus far but it was not clear to me whether he was able to say when he hopes that the technique will shift to criterion-referencing <e> <s> granted that the system will always be imperfect is there a date as regards records of achievement or are we as would be understandable simply to expect that this will be introduced as soon as is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in his speech the noble lord makes so many relevant points that i ask him to withdraw one point which he made <e> <s> the deficits under the labour government reflected massive government overspending <e> <s> it is totally different now where we are running a massive government repayment of debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree warmly with much that has been said by every speaker <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend lord de la warr upon surviving so effectively the ordeal of his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> that is probably true my lords but it is very difficult to measure the productivity of hairdressers for example <e> <s> there are statistical difficulties in measuring service productivity <e> <s> nevertheless our neighbours have the same problem <e> <s> in terms of the gap that is reflected between our own and overseas markets and of the impact of overseas manufactures coming into our shops it is manufacturing productivity as well as service productivity that matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that entrepreneurship which is not a gift that i have is motivated to some extent by money <e> <s> however i believe that it is also motivated by a search for fulfilment for satisfaction or for power <e> <s> in answer to the right reverend prelate i should say that no limit should be laid down in law <e> <s> taxation has an effect upon different earning levels <e> <s> competition the satisfaction of markets and the law are the disciplines upon entrepreneurs <e> <s> the answer to that question in my view is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene particularly after the noble lord has been so kind to me but that is unfair to the noble lord lord harris of high cross who is absent <e> <s> he simply believes that we would be effective in the things that we want to do for all our citizens if we let business run better <e>", "<cs> my lords but there would be a bigger cake too more if you like <e>", "<cs> my lords at six oclock i have a long standing meeting arranged in this palace with a very busy minister <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will excuse me if i absent myself briefly from the debate at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is not only the quantity of investment which matters but it is the use to which it is put <e> <s> in this country thanks largely to union problems we have the lowest output per unit of investment of any of our competitors <e> <s> that has been improving in the past years but it has been a great clog on our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i must point out to him that he is wrong <e> <s> one of the achievements of the labour government from onwards was to build up a manufacturing surplus to replace a then invisible deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the problem we have met recently has been that the government have failed to restrain the boom <e> <s> the party of the noble lord was urging us to adopt an even more relaxed monetary policy than <e>", "<cs> that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord spoke as he said he did but the impression given by the party to which he belongs was that monetarism was restraining spending when it should be expanded <e>", "<cs> my lords it is tantalising to have only eight minutes in which to reply to that packed speech <e> <s> i should like to quarrel with very nearly all its components <e> <s> to answer the noble lords main question yes as someone who takes responsibility to some extent for the strategy which the incoming conservative government of adopted i should have gone ahead with that strategy <e> <s> i do not regret it <e> <s> of course i accept that individual components of that policy need constant refinement in order to get them right <e> <s> however in general as i shall seek to explain in the limited time available to me i do not regret the general drift of the governments intentions and efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recognise that at the end of those years we were the poor man of north-west europe <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friends speech which contains assurances that the amendment could do no harm and will do good will be seriously considered by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships that because of a commitment made before the business of this week was known i may have to leave before the conclusion of the debate <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in paying tribute to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord soulsby of swaffham prior <e> <s> the noble lord was too modest to tell us the truth namely that he is the first veterinarian or veterinary surgeon or more simply vet to have sat in either house of parliament <e> <s> we can congratulate him and ourselves on that as well as on the content and delivery of his speech <e>"]
