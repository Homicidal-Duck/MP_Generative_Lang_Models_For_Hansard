["<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord plowden for providing the opportunity for this debate and for the way in which he has presented the conclusion of the committee on which i was privileged to sit <e> <s> like others i must declare my interest as a merchant banker though not one involved with any member of the accepting houses committee <e> <s> but i should like to emphasise that the views which i express and they may be fairly forceful are my own and are not necessarily those of my employers <e> <s> i should also very much like to congratulate the noble earl lord airlie and the noble viscount lord chandos on their maiden speeches <e> <s> i admire them very much for having chosen a contentious subject and they have shown great courage in doing so <e> <s> i also admire them for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am fortunate or unfortunate in following the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> certainly what he says has persuaded me to alter to some extent the argument that i was going to make <e> <s> it seems to me obvious that the noble lord totally misunderstands one of the main purposes of the governments policy which is to increase the chances for really productive investment in this country <e> <s> this obviously escapes the noble lords attention <e> <s> indeed unless there are good projects capital will not be invested and we have seen that for years past <e> <s> it certainly will not be invested in productive projects <e>", "<cs> capital has to be attracted my lords and unless there is direction of investment which perhaps the noble lord would prefer it is inconceivable that capital will go into companies which are about to become bankrupt <e> <s> that is the whole problem <e> <s> what the government it seems to me are trying to do is to make industry more healthy and attractive for capital to invest in and if it does so then no doubt more capital will remain in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord lever of manchester for bringing to your lordships house the opportunity to debate the very important question of how the government should help solve the current very serious deficit financing problems <e> <s> before setting out my own personal views i should declare a personal interest in the subject as a director of an international bank <e> <s> therefore i suppose that i should have to admit that i am one of those stupid chaps to whom the noble lord referred earlier but i shall try to prove otherwise <e> <s> the opinions that i set out will be my own <e>", "<cs> my lords of course one has studied the position of the american banks and one has also studied the position of many other banks <e> <s> there are some american banks which are more extended in this matter than others <e> <s> i should like to come on to the question of how a bank defends itself which is through its profits <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord is more happy about the british banks <e> <s> i shall come on to the point now <e>", "<cs> my lords well intentioned as i believe that suggestion is i can only speak personally <e> <s> there is hardly anything that would frighten one more as a banker than the prospect of trying to obtain timely decisions from such a body <e> <s> rather i believe that the government should be encouraged to use the existing institutions already established <e> <s> the imf has as last been dragged to the centre of the stage and at the summit conference held at versailles in june it was allotted the task of helping the major powers coordinate their policies to the best advantage of the world economy <e> <s> in my humble opinion governments should follow that resolve through urgently and with more resources <e> <s> that is where i agree with the noble lord so much <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am sufficiently experienced to give a totally educated view on that point <e> <s> i think that a sovereign borrower could go bankrupt and this is the great fear in the present situation <e> <s> the present situation is one that requires very careful handling if only to encourage sovereign borrowers who are already in difficulties not to default <e> <s> anybody can in a sense go bankrupt <e> <s> people might be very unwise to take that course <e> <s> they have to be encouraged by further help not to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have to agree with that <e> <s> in fact one of the problems of commercial banks who have been lending is that they have been unable effectively to impose conditions which the imf might have done <e> <s> that makes the whole situation more serious <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the general tone of what has been said before is that the problem is that the international monetary institutions have not become involved <e> <s> it is not a question of competition among the commercial banks it is a question of the lack of the right type of finance becoming available <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i think that ignores the very considerable general provisions which have been built up over many years to deal with just this fairly thank god <e> <s> unusual situation <e> <s> for the noble lord to make that statement without taking that into account is i think rather irresponsible <e>", "<cs> but my lords the principal banks involved in this in this country are the clearing banks and they declare their general provisions totally without any secrecy whatever <e> <s> so i am not sure what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the present high level of unemployment and in particular of long-term unemployment is a matter of very great concern and as has been evidenced in this debate there is no monopoly on this concern <e> <s> as we have seen it is shared by all political parties indeed by all human beings <e> <s> i am sure that not only all members of your lordships house but many outside will be very grateful for the opportunity which the noble lord lord beswick has given us to debate these various issues <e> <s> personally i have seen the hardships and the demoralisation which affects friends and relations who are or have been unemployed <e> <s> again personally and i hope your lordships do not mind my being so personal i have four children all of whom will be seeking employment in the next years so i can honestly say that my concern is very deep just as deep as that so compassionately illustrated by the maiden speech of the noble lord lord monkswell <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to agree with the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls on this point <e> <s> first as i understand it the date on which we were going to be televised was agreed remarkably later than when the starred questions were put down <e> <s> secondly i think that the subject which has been proposed in the motion is so important that it deserves further consideration <e> <s> i am sorry but i totally disagree with the noble lords point <e>"]
