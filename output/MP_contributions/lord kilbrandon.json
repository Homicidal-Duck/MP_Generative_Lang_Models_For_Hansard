["<cs> my lords with some diffidence but without any doubts i shall ask your lordships to reject this order <e> <s> i can put the fundamental reasons very shortly and perhaps too simply <e> <s> parliament after a long detailed and i am afraid controversial examination decided that the act would be for the better government of scotland <e> <s> that is why it was passed <e> <s> i shall mention later the section providing for a referendum <e> <s> but at this moment i should like to emphasise that in past years over and over again the people of scotland have been asked and have asked themselves whether they wish some form of self-government through their own elected representatives and they have always answered yes i am not much impressed by the assertion that in these polls the question must have been misunderstood but always subject to the continuing political unity of the united kingdom <e> <s> indeed influential and experienced supporters of the present administration have maintained while expressing their dislike of the act that some radical change of a devolutionary character is called for not even excluding a federal system embracing as members the other sub-divisions of great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is in a better position to answer for the people he is quoting than i am myself but i deliberately left all this part out of the speech with which i detained your lordships for too long because i said that it was something in which your lordships were probably no longer interested <e> <s> however another reason for leaving it out is that it is a kind of barren semantic exercise <e> <s> the other way of looking at it is that if every single man and woman who voted no had stayed at home in bed this order would have been before the house just the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to ask the house to divide <e> <s> i have not changed my mind in any way at all but i am not going to ask the house to divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad indeed that the noble lord lord underhill has raised the question for this reason <e> <s> i think that the report of the new ireland forum has in a sense brought us face to face with an emergency <e> <s> what i mean by that is that my experience on the independent inquiry leads me to believe that we are at a juncture right now <e> <s> what we do may have a tremendous and decisive effect on the peace and security of northern ireland <e> <s> that is even more true of what we do not do <e> <s> if we do not do something now at this juncture we may be throwing away an opportunity and the consequences of that may be irreparable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should correct that what the noble lord said is not true <e>"]
