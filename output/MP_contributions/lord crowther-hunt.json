["<cs> my lords as a very new member of your lordships eec committee and also of its sub-committee on food and agriculture i feel very hesitant indeed about venturing any opinion on the highly complex problem of the reform of the common market agricultural policy and indeed on the <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us must be most indebted to the noble lord lord alport for introducing this bill because in my view there are two major reasons why the bill is so important that it should as i hope it will get on to the statute book in the very near future <e> <s> first i see the bill as important in itself in these difficult political and constitutional times <e> <s> secondly and perhaps even more importantly in my view it is the only way of preventing a possible head-on clash between her majesty the queen and a future labour government committed to the abolition of your lordships house and to a unicameral system of government <e> <s> that could be a clash in which her majesty was in direct personal conflict with a labour government as she sought to carry out her constitutional duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that intervention <e> <s> this is not yet the official policy of the labour party it was made by a member of another place off the cuff as it were at the last labour party conference <e> <s> one of the things which tends to happen is that what the same gentleman says one day often becomes the policy of the national executive the next day <e> <s> but more seriously the point that i want to emphasise is that if there is such an official proposal eventually from the labour party itself and if such a proposal finds its way into the election manifesto the one thing that is certain is that the government themselves cannot create peers even if they commit themselves to the mass creation of peers in an election manifesto <e> <s> only the queen can create peers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond to that it is the official policy of the labour party <e> <s> i was very careful to say that it was the policy of the labour party <e> <s> anything passed by the annual conference with a more than two-thirds majority as this was is the official policy of the party <e> <s> it is true that it is not yet in the labour party election manifesto and the former leader of the labour party got into enor <e>", "<cs> my lords this has really been a most interesting and valuable debate marked of course by that distinguished maiden speech from the noble baroness lady platt <e> <s> i should like to say <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of priorities i should like to ask the noble lord the foreign secretary how seriously he considered as an alternative priority cutting the costs in our diplomatic service overseas <e> <s> as i understand it and is this a fact <e> <s> the savings for example by cutting the spanish service of the bbc will amount to a year whereas the staff costs of the british embassy in madrid i am referring to pay and allowances amount to between million and million a year <e> <s> so a per cent <e> <s> saving there would make it unnecessary to cut the spanish service at all <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord perhaps to be kind enough to look at this question of priorities on a cost-effective basis <e>", "<cs> my lords when following a noble lords maiden speech it is the tradition of this house an extraordinarily valuable tradition to congratulate the noble lord for also following the traditions of this house in making a non-controversial maiden speech <e> <s> well may i on this occasion congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for behaving with such skill and reminding me so much of the irish judge who always strove to follow the narrow path between partiality and impartiality and in that spirit may i offer the noble lord lord campbell of alloway the congratulations and hope that he will <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer the precise question i put and not just try to brush us off with the figures which were introduced by the noble lord lord carrington when i asked a supplementary question some weeks ago <e> <s> if the noble lord is not able to do so now then perhaps he <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord byers for putting down this unstarred question and like him and other noble lords who have spoken in this debate so far i am disappointed at the governments response to the clear majority view expressed in your lordships house in that debate on th july <e> <s> however quickly and briefly i want just to make two points <e> <s> the first of these is about the spanish service <e> <s> it is at least something that the government are ready to maintain a recorded tape service <e> <s> but of course as the noble lord lord kilmarnock has pointed out this does not get us very far <e> <s> at most as i understand it this might produce some three hours of material a week <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord kilmarnock also pointed out whether any of it ever gets broadcast in spain will depend entirely on the decisions of the two main broadcasting services in spain the state-controlled radio service and spains main private commercial network <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the noble lord lord pennock that he could not stay on long enough to make his speech so he indicated that i should follow the noble lord lord fulton <e>", "<cs> at the risk of taking it just beyond midnight may i congratulate the noble lord lord wilson of riveaulx on his maiden speech <e> <s> no doubt that is a rather presumptious thing to do for someone who gave me the privilege of a junior post in one of his governments but not to have referred to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord wilson might have been misinterpreted in some way or other and i prefer to he presumptious rather than to be misinterpreted <e>"]
