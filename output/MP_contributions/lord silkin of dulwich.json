["<cs> my lord may i begin by thanking the noble baroness lady trumpington for her general welcome to maiden speakers and if i am allowed to do so at the same time express my gratitude to individual members from all parts of your lordships house for their very generous welcome to this particular rather elderly maiden <e> <s> i do so with the thought in mind that there is of course a tradition of generosity from your lordships to fellow members of the house i hope not to take too great an advantage of that and certainly not today and because i believe that that welcome owes something at least to the respect which members of this house felt for my father who in the last two decades of his life devoted his time to this house for which he developed a very great affection <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord irving of dartford in his amendment <e> <s> i do so for two reasons first of all because the words which he seeks to remove in my view are totally unnecessary in that the duty upon the authorities must involve a duty upon the appropriate officers to carry out the authoritys duty secondly because it seems to me to create a nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether on the basis of the argument that has been put forward the noble lord would wish to add and their councillors <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise on this matter to support my noble friend lord mishcon and i regretfully find myself in disagreement with the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> if i may say so i supported him on the last amendment which we lost <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he will explain the point that he is making in reply to my comment <e> <s> i am afraid that i have not followed it <e> <s> that i am sure is my fault <e> <s> in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would agree that the reason those words are necessary is that the bill is about kerb crawling and nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill is about kerb crawling and about nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the words that are used are much worse than the words that were avoided <e> <s> at least one had to show some evidence of annoyance <e> <s> now all that one has to do is show something which is likely to cause it <e> <s> that is a totally subjective view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister is thinking about that as he was good enough to say that he would respond to a later intervention by myself can he answer this point <e> <s> i am seriously trying to follow what this is intended to achieve <e> <s> this is not a criticism but an attempt to understand <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying how much i agree with my noble friend lord houghton <e> <s> it really is unfortunate that a bill which could be confined to a very simple short point to avoid as far as possible the nuisance of kerb crawling should have tacked onto it something as fundamental as that which we are now discussing <e> <s> i say that it is fundamental because it is right that one should consider this carefully as a general concept if one is <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view and i think it is a view which would commend itself to all noble lords the criminal law should be used only in circumstances in which it is absolutely vital that an offence should be recorded as committed and secondly it should be expressed only in terms which are of the utmost clarity so that people know whether they are committing an offence or not <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder at the beginning of his remarks drew attention to the lack of clarity in this bill and indeed expressed his regret as we all do that it should be coming at this stage to this house to try to clear up what my noble friend lord mishcon has described as a mess <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move this amendment <e> <s> this is not i hope quite such an explosive proposal as the last amendment to which the house gave its attention but it is not a purely semantic proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his assurance that there is nothing between us on the meaning and effect that we desire to produce by this clause <e> <s> i hope that i am correct in taking him to mean by that that in the circumstances that i posited of a conflict of interest then the councils duty would be to seek to avoid such a conflict unless that conflict was unlikely to do any harm to the purchaser <e> <s> if that be so and i hope that i have understood the noble and learned lord correctly then what has been said in this short debate will have been noted and heard <e> <s> in those circumstances it is i think sufficient for me to ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in reply to my noble friend on the front bench explained the job start scheme as an inducement to employers to take on the long-term unemployed <e> <s> if that is the function of the job start scheme does it not necessarily follow that employers will be induced by paying less than the going rate for the job <e> <s> is that the intention of the job start scheme <e> <s> is it not odd that that should be put into effect at the very time when the government are proposing to castrate the powers of the wages councils <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my great privilege and on this occasion my very great pleasure to be able to congratulate the noble earl on his first speech in this house <e> <s> he has made his points persuasively with wit and briefly and we certainly look forward to hearing him on many future occasions <e> <s> the fact that i agree very strongly with much of what the noble earl says perhaps influences me even more to award him those congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for the useful contribution to discussions on the complex subject of limitation <e> <s> the problem which he has highlighted is fundamental to the area of consideration of the law reform committee <e> <s> as i see it that problem is to achieve a fair balance between the desirability of certainty in the law and the need to do justice to the person who is damaged by somebody elses default <e>", "<cs> i agree very much with what was said by the noble lord lord winstanley and by the noble and learned lord lord denning and i disagree with the remarks which have just been made <e> <s> as it appears to me it is not i agree a question of what ultimately the courts are likely to find in a particular case what in practice happens we are talking now i hope about sensible local authorities and not about extremist local authorities is that if they want to do something if they want to issue some document which is what we are concerned with they will be advised by their officers whether they can do so within the law <e> <s> in a case that may be a borderline one their officers are probably going to take legal advice <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has clearly explained this paragraph to his own satisfaction but with all respect to him he has not explained it to my satisfaction <e> <s> i still do not understand the purpose of it or what it will achieve <e>", "<cs> what i am saying is that this paragraph is totally unnecessary and that it is extremely difficult to follow precisely what it is intended to do <e> <s> the example that i have given indicates that on many occasions the campaign will have a dual effect <e> <s> it will have the effect of enhancing the view relating to the issue and it will also have the effect of affecting public support for the political party whose measures are being opposed and the political party opposing those measures <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i wonder whether he can tell the committee the position the other way round <e> <s> if a local authority were minded to use its agendas or reports to it for the purpose of political propaganda knowing that under the provisions of the act the public will have access to that material would the bill bite upon it <e>", "<cs> i rise partly to support what was said by my noble friend with regard to political parties and by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> when i read the words in question i immediately turned to the various definitions to learn what is a political party but i did not find any such definition <e> <s> i remain ignorant and the noble lord who has just spoken increases my ignorance when he refers quite rightly to the mounting of campaigns <e> <s> i ask myself this question when does a campaign or those who conduct it become a political party <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i find myself very much in agreement <e>", "<cs> as i was saying before giving way to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway not for the first time i find myself very much <e>", "<cs> i am accustomed to the honeyed words of the noble lord lord broxbourne both here and in other tribunals where i have had sometimes the misfortune sometimes the good fortune to oppose him <e> <s> on this occasion i am afraid that i have to exclude myself from the category of right-thinking members of the committee as defined by the noble lord and also possibly by the noble lord lord chalfont whose amendment this is and who is doubtless encouraging our representatives in another sphere a more sporting sphere than that covered by this legislation at the moment <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i do so for this reason <e> <s> there has been a <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by congratulating the noble lord lord perry of walton on the clarity care and perhaps i might say courage with which he from the back benches has presented this bill <e> <s> both he and the noble lord lord airedale supported it on the basis that the events that it is intended to deal with are very unlikely to happen and very improbable <e> <s> i rather wondered on hearing that what sort of scenario they were suggesting might be the scenario following the next general election <e> <s> to some extent my anxieties were assuaged by listening to my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby whose speeches are always so very entertaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i always have a dislike for unnecessary words in a statute <e> <s> when i see in two parts of a subsection the words particular regard and regard then i assume that the word particular is an unncessary word unless there is something to indicate the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his clear exposition of a bill on a highly complex subject <e> <s> in doing so perhaps i may also be permitted to express my thanks and i am sure those of the house for the clear and interesting report of the law reform committee upon which the bill is based <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this discussion <e> <s> to quite a large extent they have perfectly properly and not unexpectedly regarded this amendment as an aunt sally <e> <s> i do not object to that at all because i think that putting forward the amendment has helped a great deal in finding what common ground there is <e> <s> i was particularly gratified by the opening words of the speech of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in which he set out very clearly the areas where he and i find ourselves in agreement <e> <s> no doubt there will be other noble lords who echo what he has said <e> <s> i think it has probably also been of value in disclosing clearly at a very early stage the position of the government through the remarks of the noble viscount so that future amendments will no doubt be viewed against the background of the policy which the government have announced <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment very strongly and i do so for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that i find it quite extraordinary that an amendment can be moved the purpose of which is to give effect to the bill in making the convention part of the law of the united kingdom while at the same time that same amendment is removing from the law of the united kingdom a major part of that very convention <e> <s> it is an inherent part of the convention to provide the remedies which are referred to in subsection and to follow the procedures in subsection <e> <s> one cannot possibly profess to be bringing the convention within our law while at the same time removing the remedies which it contains <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> i agree with the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord lloyd of <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one word to what has been said so forcefully <e> <s> it is to draw attention to what one might call the guidance given to the secretary of state by the subsection in his decision as to the regulations being made <e> <s> that guidance is by reference to such considerations as appear to him to be appropriate <e> <s> in other words he has no guidance at all <e> <s> parliament is not telling him what he should give consideration to or what matters ought to affect his mind <e> <s> it is entirely open to the decision of the secretary of state himself <e> <s> that surely cannot be right <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by assuring the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that i am not moving this amendment as a result of the circumstances that affected me personally because notwithstanding the lapse of years since the construction of the building i was in the fortunate position of being able to obtain recompense through my insurer <e> <s> however i could not help feeling when that mishap occurred that there would be other people who were not so fortunate <e> <s> i had them in mind particularly if the circumstance were such and i do not suggest that this was the case of my own house that the serious defect which arose was the result of negligence whether negligence of the original builder the architect or somebody else associated with the development <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with both the speeches which the house has just heard <e> <s> i would not wish to take up the time of the house by elaborating upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a little difficulty over this matter because it seems to me having heard the debate today and also the earlier one at the committee stage that the existing subsection the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord lloyd of hampstead and that put forward by the noble lord lord broxbourne are all intended to have precisely the same effect which is to declare what the existing constitutional law is <e> <s> i listened only a few moments ago to the noble lord lord broxbourne saying and i wholly agreed with him that declaratory provisions are better avoided in our law and should not be needed in properly drafted legislation <e> <s> however in this case i think that there should be a firm affirmation which nobody can doubt that the purpose of this bill is not to affect in any way our constitutional law <e> <s> the question really is which of these alternatives best gives effect to that <e>", "<cs> but my lords if one is looking at the two words i think unavoidable is a better word <e> <s> also i personally prefer the word and in the context to the substituted word or which is in the amendment of the noble lord lord broxbourne where it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am smiling simply because it seems to leave the court of appeal admittedly in the minority but nonetheless with the decision in the majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that i was extremely pleased to listen to the moderate and persuasive speech of the noble lord lord foot which if i may say so with all respect to two old friends of mine came between two speeches that tended to go to extremes in opposite directions <e> <s> i do not think that the valid case which my noble friend lord paget had was made better by going to extremes <e> <s> as put by the noble lord lord foot it was much more persuasive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> one point that puzzles me which perhaps he can explain is that in relation to an earlier amendment when we were considering whether there should be something in the bill to provide for consultation by the secretary of state the reply was that of course the secretary of state would consult without anything appearing about it in the bill <e> <s> why does not the same apply here <e> <s> surely the board will have regard to guidance and the secretary of state will be able to give guidance even if it does not appear in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment and i do so only to deal if i can with one point which might conceivably be raised <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by expressing sympathy at least from this side of the house with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the hope that no latent defect results from the unhappy events that took place on waterloo bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend sections and of the criminal justice act and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords if one is permitted to define what is the intention of the amendment even though the printed word does not seem to follow that intention precisely then certainly the opposition supports it <e> <s> it is in our view a valuable clarifying amendment <e> <s> however before it becomes clarifying it seems plain from the remarks of the noble and learned lords lord denning and lord wilber-force that some adjustment will have to be made to the printed word <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord renton will not feel aggrieved if i say that i agree entirely with all that he has said <e> <s> it seems to me that where the draftsman has fallen into pardonable error is that he has tried to bring everything into the clause that he could think of to cover all possible events that could conceivably happen <e> <s> in doing so it is entirely praiseworthy he has made the clause extremely difficult either to construe or to operate in practice <e> <s> although noble lords from this side of the committee spoke as usual with great clarity and lucidity they made me feel that if i was a member of a bench of magistrates seeking in a particular case to dissect the facts in the light of the views that they have expressed as to the meaning of the clause as it now stands i would have very great difficulty <e>", "<cs> i want to add only one word <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for agreeing to look at this again with a view to shortening it as the noble lord said <e> <s> i would sooner say that it be with a view to clarifying it <e>", "<cs> nobody in this chamber would in any way wish to condone the type of conduct about which the noble lord lord plant has been speaking or to water it down in any way <e> <s> the doubt which i have about these clauses is not related to the need for condign punishment for those who make use of the practice described here <e> <s> it is simply a question of whether this is the proper place to deal with it and whether it is necessary to deal with it or whether it is already in the offences dealt with in the explosive substances legislation <e> <s> that is legislation which my memory tells me is always subject to the necessity to obtain the consent of the attorney-general for prosecution because some instances of this kind of conduct that i remember coming across were not worthy of imprisonment for life or indeed in some cases any imprisonment at all whereas others were extraordinarily serious <e> <s> there is therefore that safeguard in the explosive substances legislation <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that every member of the committee will have great sympathy with the problems that affect the farmer in particular and landowners generally whether from hippies those who frequent pop festivals or anybody else <e> <s> the committee will want the government to continue i hope that i may say to continue to look at the matter and come to a helpful view bearing in mind that the problems are not on one side only as one noble lord reminded us <e> <s> there are the problems of walkers and of those who own a piece of land and the problems that will afflict magistrates if they have to go into such questions in the criminal courts <e> <s> one must not assume that the problems are all on one side and that they can be dealt with simply by a new provision in the criminal law <e>", "<cs> i do not know enough about the law of scotland to answer in regard to an interdict but for england and wales the civil remedy by way of injunction could take as long to get as it took the landlord or his representative to find and to give the facts to a judge <e> <s> it takes no longer than that <e> <s> if i am asked whether that remedy will be as effective as the remedies that we are invited to agree to in these amendments i should put this to the committee if an injunction is disobeyed one can go to the judge and say to him there has been a contempt of court <e> <s> if the judge so wishes he can have the people concerned brought before him and can imprison them <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord can help me <e> <s> i appreciate that this is still very much a matter under consideration <e> <s> at present is it proposed that the power of the police should be in the air and left to their own decision or a back-up power to a provision of the civil courts <e> <s> in other words will they be left to take the risk that they may be wrong or are they going to act only when a civil court has said yes you can go ahead <e>", "<cs> the minister indicated clearly that wherever the boundary line is drawn there will be anomalies <e> <s> i understand the point that he makes <e> <s> it relates more to a foreign element invading a persons dwelling area than to what the person does within his dwelling area <e> <s> if one is thinking solely of what the person does within his dwelling area it seems to me that the amendment is perfectly proper <e> <s> but i can see the force of the argument directed to somebody from outside who comes in <e>", "<cs> there are useful definitions in planning law for example as to what a dwelling includes <e> <s> i welcome that help but i am not sure that it gets over the difficulty which the minister has put forward and which arises only where someone comes in from outside <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the minister <e> <s> with that undertaking i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the last observation of the minister put a new complexion on the existing definition within the interpretation clause that i must confess i had not been aware of <e> <s> i had thought that the example was put there because it meant throwing at or towards a person a missile of a kind capable of causing injury that was intended to cause injury but that did not hit or fell short <e> <s> i gather now from the minister that that is riot intended that is to say that the example given is intended to be within the mischief of violence even if there was never any intention that it should hit or that it should arrive at its target or apparent target <e> <s> that seems to me to widen considerably the definition of violence <e> <s> it is something that i would want to consider further <e>", "<cs> if the government rest their case on the words engages in it seems to me that they are resting it on sand <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord hacking that to say that one engages in an activity cannot reasonably be construed as a continuous activity in the sense that the noble lord the minister has suggested <e> <s> at the same time i do not myself think that the plural which the noble lord lord hacking seeks to insert cures the difficulty to which he has drawn attention quite apart from anything else because of the provisions of the interpretation act <e>", "<cs> i find that reply a little disappointing <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord morton that the form of the amendment is not satisfactory <e> <s> nonetheless the difficulty to which it draws attention is a very real one <e> <s> i speak from experience as a member of the governing body of <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that the noble and learned lord would give a more detailed explanation of the wording of amendment no <e> <s> than merely to say that there had been representations and it has been drafted to meet them <e> <s> unfortunately not having been a party to those representations i am not wholly clear as to what they were and what the amendment seeks to do in relation to them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and on that point i should like to ask him whether this is not relevant to the whole question of continuity which we were discussing on an earlier amendment <e> <s> is it not the case that the difference between the situation here and the earlier situation is precisely the holding out to which the minister <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat puzzled by what the noble lord said about the certificate <e> <s> as i understand the position a certificate is a complete protection but if one does not have a certificate that does not mean that one is unprotected <e> <s> as understand paragraph as a newspaper one can still show that one falls within the exception under paragraph <e> <s> what is the point of this certificate procedure <e> <s> why not leave it to the newspaper to be able to establish one way or the other <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and the minister will correct me if i am wrong if the secretary of state does not do so and complaint is made the newspaper can still show to the appropriate person whoever it may be whether it be the court or anyone else that it falls within the provisions of clause and that it is excepted <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate began his remarks by saying that he would wish to be cautious about removal of the phrase ought to have known <e> <s> i hope that he will be very cautious indeed about that <e> <s> it seems to me that that would very much reduce the effectiveness of this provision <e> <s> while there may well be a good case for amendment no <e> <s> or something on the lines of the principle of amendment no <e> <s> giving the court powers which reflect the justice of the situation it does not seem to me at any rate that that should be confined to the region to which amendment no <e> <s> would confine it the situation where there was knowledge but not imputed knowledge <e>", "<cs> if i may leave the area of semantics and come to the area of practicalities i wonder why this is confined to that which in any form is legible <e> <s> why not any guidance whether it be legible or not <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it is right that the intention is quite clear <e> <s> with respect it certainly is not clear to me <e> <s> as it stands whatever word you use it would seem to be intended to rule out guidance that is given verbally <e> <s> is that what is intended and if so why <e>", "<cs> the minister has clearly and admirably defined what is meant by sufficient <e> <s> might not words similar to those which he has used be inserted into the schedule at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> he has explained i am not sure whether wholly satisfactorily i shall need to read what he has said in the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for that helpful explanation <e> <s> at the same time the dispute between the secretary of state or the sib as the case may be and the sro may precisely be whether the rule that has been made brings the sro into compliance with the requirements <e> <s> the sro says yes the sib says no and the sro says we shall adhere to our rule <e> <s> we do not agree with you <e> <s> they may be right <e> <s> they are then taken to court by way of <e>", "<cs> the more i listen to the noble lord the minister the more i feel that this clause as it stands is full of holes and anomalies <e> <s> the minister has kindly said that he will think about wedding receptions and i hope he will also think about sponsored walks and events of that kind which may fall within clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for promising to think about this again even within the limits that he has indicated <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that at the end of the day we may find that a numerical limit of some kind is the only practical solution <e> <s> however by all means let the government think about other possibilities <e> <s> we for our part will also think about the very real problem and no doubt we shall return to it at the next stage <e>", "<cs> it is my intention in not more than seconds from now to ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may first say one word in support of what my noble friend lord mishcon said with regard to subsection <e> <s> the provision there is that the exemption applies <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have contributed to this debate particularly those who have brought a great deal of knowledge of the city <e>", "<cs> i begin by apologising to the minister for the short notice of this amendment <e> <s> he will understand that it is not only the government who have been put under great pressure by this legislation <e> <s> it is not easy to absorb a very large number of amendments and new clauses emanating from the government and at the same time to give careful scrutiny to the existing clauses in the bill so as to bring forward amendments in good time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for making that point which i do not suggest is an invalid one but the fact is that investigations under the provisions of the companies act are a very different type of investigation from the majority of other investigations of this kind <e> <s> they produce an entirely different result <e> <s> what happens is that at the end of the day there is a report to a minister <e> <s> the minister may or may not act upon it <e> <s> that report may or may not be published <e> <s> however enormous harm can be done to people if reports containing a great deal of criticism are published <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to take up any more of the time of the committee because i think that the issues are very clear <e> <s> we are dealing here with a special procedure which ends in a report which may never be seen by the person criticised <e> <s> that is the vital difference between this and many other cases where there is no specific provision <e> <s> in those circumstances it seems to me to be right to test the feeling of the committee and i shall do so <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might ask the minister one or two questions about the clause <e> <s> can he tell the committee whether there is any precedent for <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has told us about this bill <e> <s> we shall obviously need to look at it again <e> <s> it is an important principle <e> <s> the noble lord tells us that it is not completely novel <e> <s> he has cited one semi-precedent that we shall want to look at <e> <s> apart from that we shall certainly want to look at the extra-territorial aspect of the clause <e> <s> on the face of what the minister has said it would appear that if a prohibition were made then if information were given by say one us citizen to <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i wonder whether he would be kind enough to say how it is intended to make the choice as to which institution or institutions from the particular country concerned will be the unfortunate recipient of a notice under any of these clauses <e>", "<cs> i do not altogether follow that point <e> <s> what we are dealing with here is the revision of a clause which excludes a claim for damages in any case other than a bad faith case <e> <s> i do not see how in those circumstances that would include the wording that the noble viscount has just referred to <e>", "<cs> we are of course grateful and the committee will be grateful to the minister for that extremely detailed explanation of the governments position <e> <s> on the first amendment and the first part of the second amendment the noble lord referred to the views expressed by the noble viscount <e> <s> it seemed to me and i shall have to read carefully in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will not be thought in any way impertinent of me if i congrat-ulate those noble lords who have stayed the course on this long debate on their stamina which i hope not to impose on too greatly <e> <s> in particular may i congratulate the noble baroness lady young who has certainly had an extremely hard day today <e> <s> she shows no sign of strain as yet but who knows what may happen in the next ten minutes or so <e>", "<cs> on this side of the committee we have a good deal of sympathy with the objective behind the amendment moved by the noble viscount <e> <s> it will be seen from the second part of amendment no <e> <s> a and a subsequent amendment to another clause that my noble friends and myself have put down proposals very much along the lines of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however the amendment to which i wish to address myself contains two separate parts <e> <s> it looks back to the provisions of the act of <e> <s> it seeks to introduce into the present bill wording that is in line with the provisions of the act <e> <s> the first paragraph deals with the display of flags and banners <e> <s> this is not a point with which the noble viscount deals in his amendment <e> <s> we feel however that it would be logical to put these matters into an amendment that deals with disguise <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord has in his mind the point that is being made <e> <s> it is that nobody is suggesting that the mere use of disguise is a bad thing <e> <s> all that the amendment does is to give the police power to impose a condition in circumstances where they think it necessary to do so where there is a real belief that disguise will be used in order to conceal the identity of people taking part in the procession <e> <s> that is surely something that he would regard as being improper <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl would be kind enough to explain the point which arises from what my noble friend lord mishcon said <e> <s> the noble earl seems to be saying not that there is already inherent in the clause a power to make such a condition but rather it would not be necessary anyhow and therefore not be put in the bill for that reason <e> <s> is my interpretation of his view correct <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> we regard this as a matter of very great importance as i am quite sure judging by the discussion in the white paper the government do <e> <s> but we do not arrive at the same conclusion as the government have arrived at very much for the reasons which the noble lord has given <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept the new clause <e> <s> we on these benches believe that it is undesirable in principle and probably impracticable to enforce <e> <s> before coming to the main objection may i take up a point referred to about the drafting <e> <s> i am not myself clear as to what in practice the penalty would refer <e> <s> the words are <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i am not totally satisfied with the reply given <e> <s> indeed the very fact that one can come back after a year to apply for the termination of the order a fact to which the noble earl drew our attention seems to suggest that the intention at any rate is that the period should be a relatively small one not more than two or three years <e> <s> to leave it completely at large seems to be a means of encouraging the courts to impose absurdly large orders so that people have to come back on appeal <e> <s> i cannot see the need for that <e>", "<cs> the speeches of noble lords have raised a very important point <e> <s> i had not intended to speak in these debates at all <e> <s> but the point is so important that i think it desirable to do so <e>", "<cs> i do not want indeed i would not be allowed to anticipate any discussion on my amendment no <e> <s> which i still hope may be reached at some time <e> <s> however may i assure the noble lord lord tranmire that what we are discussing is precisely the reason for the amendment <e> <s> the amendment accepts that the bill has become law but defers the commencement date until the select committee has finished its task and this house and another place are in a position to give their attention to the recommendations of the select committee the european parliament and other interested authorities in order to see that the regulation referred to by the noble baroness is what we would like it to be <e>", "<cs> this amendment has been a vehicle for very wide-ranging discussion <e> <s> i do not propose to ask for a lift on that vehicle but rather to address a few remarks through a direct question arising out of the amendment and the clause upon which it is based in the hope that the government will give clear elucidation of what in law that clause achieves in particular paragraph <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies can he explain how one can be entitled to withdraw an unspecific and non-particular part of an investment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would take advice on the point and write to me <e> <s> i am genuinely puzzled <e>", "<cs> there is a difficulty of borderline definition <e> <s> that is where i wholly agree with the noble earl <e> <s> i do not find myself convinced by the earlier part of his remarks but i entirely accept the intention behind what he said when he drew attention to the fact that we do not want to criminalise friends talking to one another privately <e> <s> there is no doubt that we would all agree on that <e> <s> but i am bound to say that it is very difficult to see a situation in which friends are talking to one another privately in a friendly way and in the course of his remarks one of them says something which is intended to stir up racial hatred <e> <s> surely that is the very opposite of talking in a friendly way with friends <e> <s> if that were not enough to rule out the possibility of prosecution there is as i have just said the position of the attorney-general in sanctioning prosecution as a long-stop <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for making that promise <e> <s> i understand his difficulty in coming up with a solution within two days but i hope that we shall at least be progressing towards one <e> <s> with that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord hutchinson for not being here at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> what i heard of it was certainly very persuasive and excellent <e> <s> i want to add only one word to what was said particularly by my noble friend lord mishcon who pointed out that there is very little indeed it is difficult to think of anything which does not fall within the wording of the offence excluding the words disorderly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government are being unreasonable about this point <e> <s> it is a quite minor concession that is being requested and one which cannot really put the police in difficulty <e> <s> where the police are aware that somebody will commit an offence and will be likely to travel along a certain route for example i cannot imagine that they are not astute enough immediately to inform the police areas along that route <e> <s> why in the world that same astuteness should not apply in this case is beyond my comprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am sure that he wishes always to be reasonable and in that spirit i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my reaction to the noble earls explanation is that it is extremely unlikely that the effect of my words could be narrower than the words at the moment in the bill <e> <s> the words in the bill contain two elements first that there must be intimidation which is common to both of us and secondly that it must be a particular sort of intimidation <e> <s> if the noble earl is saying that that form of intimidation may not be unlawful i can understand his argument although it is difficult to see why if it is intimidation that would not be unlawful these powers should be available to the police <e> <s> however if he is accepting that the form of intimidation referred to in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that one has to try to put into the legislation that which is practical and practicable <e> <s> i certainly wish to have that in mind <e> <s> i am bound to say on this clause that the requirement is that the police officer should reasonably believe that the purpose of the persons organising it is first the intimidation of other people and secondly that the purpose of that intimidation is to compel those other people not to do an act which they have a right to do or to do an act that they have a right not to do <e> <s> he has therefore to work out in his mind all kinds of questions of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord in this amendment <e> <s> i have been puzzled by the first part of this clause for some time <e> <s> in certain <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the time and for no other reason i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am disappointed <e> <s> to rely on history when promulgating legislation which is designed to bring the law up to date in various fields and presumably to assimilate one part of the law into another in the process seems to me to be an unfortunate way of looking at a matter of this kind <e> <s> however it is a relatively small matter and we shall certainly not put it to the test <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is to be thanked for bringing to the attention of this house the question of accessibility of information which is of concern to members of the public and in particular the question of access to personal files <e> <s> it is a wide subject and both my noble friends speech which was extremely thoughtful and delivered with great feeling and the other contributions which the house has heard concentrated for the most part on the second part of the question with regard to access to personal files <e> <s> the notable exception was my noble friend lord jenkins of putney who as i think he will agree somewhat widened the area of discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the house will wish me to thank the noble and learned lord lord templeman for the clear explanation both of the problem and of the committees proposals <e> <s> i hope i shall not embarrass him if i mention that after three years he is ceasing to be chairman of sub-committee e and also if i thank him for the work he has done as such and the numerous cogent reports which have come from his chairmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords all who so far have taken part in this debate have extended a welcome to this bill <e> <s> i do so as well because it seems to me to do a measure of belated justice to a growing number of our fellow citizens who since time immemorial have suffered injustice <e> <s> i say a growing number and i echo the concern of the noble baroness lady macleod because there is no doubt at all that the growth in the illegitimate population both in absolute terms and as a proportion of births must give rise to concern <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the intention of the clause is clear enough <e> <s> it is to cover the present and past state of affairs <e> <s> i should have thought that that could be covered by are or were <e> <s> in other words it is combining the two amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord in the course of his reply courteous as i knew it would be has put forward several points which give me at any rate some comfort <e> <s> his own sympathy i had very little doubt about before he said what he said but i am extremely glad to hear him confirm it <e> <s> the sympathy of the government and the fact that there is no opposition in the government to the general principle of citizenship going through the father is again a very important gain which this debate has achieved <e>", "<cs> the arguments put forward by the noble and learned lord seem to me to go to the whole principle not so much of the amendment as of section of the act <e> <s> the law commissions second report said and the noble and learned lord was repeating its arguments that parliament was mistaken in passing that section <e> <s> i do not intend to go into the arguments at any length today but i would say that i think they took a little lightly the cost question <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word or two on clause and particularly in relation to the amendment which my noble friend lord mishcon put down <e> <s> i considered whether i should support him on it but i came to the conclusion that i should not <e> <s> at the risk of getting a wigging from him and possibly from the law society as well since i understand that it supported it i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will be able to tell me that my reason for that is a good one <e>", "<cs> for my benefit perhaps i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can say whether a brother or sister could be or would be a party to the proceedings <e> <s> if not or if there is any doubt about it it may be that that point also needs to be looked at further <e>", "<cs> i have very great respect for the noble and learned lord but i must say that i was saddened by the speech he made to the committee <e> <s> these are very private matters between husband and wife <e> <s> the purpose of this bill is to try to remove what is regarded as the stigma of illegitimacy <e> <s> whether it is rightly so regarded or not does not matter it is still so regarded <e> <s> the bill goes a long way to removing the stigma <e>", "<cs> i only want to add one word and that is to express my approval of what the scottish law commission said when it argued that <e>", "<cs> i need say only one word in agreement with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i agree with both parts of his speech in supporting the view of the law commission in the past and i hope that some day effect will be given to its report <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of correcting a question of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down in view of his reference to blunt which might have been misconstrued when he spoke about the prime minister having revealed to the public the facts about blunt will he be good enough to confirm that immunity was granted to blunt by the late sir john hobson in early and that that fact was known to all successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords my difficulty with the amendment of my noble friend is that while it may very well as has been suggested clarify a possible deficiency in the clause as it exists it seems to create another deficiency <e> <s> the existing clause provides that the power to order the taking of blood samples should apply to the person making the application or <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord longford said in the course of his remarks with absolute correctness that on this side of the house and i am sure in all quarters of the house there is no party line or party whip and though i speak from the front bench i speak in my personal capacity <e> <s> however on one matter i am quite certain that i can speak not only in that capacity but on behalf of my party that is in congratulating the noble baroness lady braye on her admirable maiden speech which was none the worse for indeed very much the better for its brevity and for the sincerity with which it was spoken to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords my attention has been drawn to standing order no <e> <s> of the house which says that no amendment other than a privilege amendment shall be moved upon third reading of a public bill unless notice of the amendment has been given to the clerk not later than the day preceding that on which the amendment is to be moved in sufficient time to enable the amendment to be printed and circulated in the form in which it is to be moved <e> <s> that seems to support the suggestion that a manuscript amendment as such is not permissible <e> <s> whether that applies to what the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack suggests might be a misprint in which case the amendment which was handed in was correct but unfortunately was not correctly transcribed i do not know <e> <s> i should have thought it would be a ridiculous situation if a misprint cannot be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords on the procedural point it seems to me that there is a matter which the house should look at <e> <s> undoubtedly the standing order can be read in more than one way <e> <s> we may be in a situation in which we do not have further consideration of this bill if it comes from another place <e> <s> it is fortunate that there is further consideration and therefore the sensible suggestion if i may say so <e>", "<cs> as at present advised i agree with the view but would go a little further and say that the insertion of the words is identified as being would suggest that the blood tests alone quite apart from any other evidence in the case can identify and that would be quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a certain atmosphere of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> it seems to me moreover that this amendment goes far beyond the purpose and scope of clause <e> <s> we already have aid <e> <s> i do not know whether the amendment is intended to stop aid until the statutory licensing body is set up or whether it is merely intended to have the result that the provisions of clause which are consequential upon the existence of aid now do not follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the last words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i think this is a much improved bill and certainly a good deal of the improvement flows from the persistence of my noble friend lord kilbracken in putting forward his amendments <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i describe them as semantic amendments i do not use the word semantic in any derogatory sense <e>", "<cs> my lords my justification for intervening in this debate on a very difficult subject with which i have never professed to be especially familiar is that like the noble and learned lord lord denning i find aspects of the bill worrying constitutionally and disturbing as possible precedents for the future <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has already said that view is shared by eminent academic lawyers who have written the letter to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not disputing the matters put forward by the noble baroness but would she not agree that the power to specify must be a power which is within the proper practices and not outside them <e> <s> therefore if there is any doubt about that that doubt ought to be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord undertaking on behalf of the government that the secretary of state will not specify except in relation to a matter which is a proper practice within subsection <e> <s> if he is saying that would he object to an amendment which makes that plain on the face of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the motion which has been moved by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> in doing so i too should like to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for the very good sense of his intervention in this matter <e> <s> he is always emollient and i hope more so than ever on this occasion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has given an explanation of the necessity for specification <e> <s> however there remain two points which seem to me to be of importance as regards the drafting of clause <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i have listened with a little surprise to the distinguished noble lord lord campbell of alloway deprecating the idea of asking the courts to decide those matters which customarily come before the courts that is to say matters which fall within the legislation and matters which fall outside the legislation <e> <s> i listened with growing amazement to the explanation given by the minister <e> <s> it seemed very much to turn on its head the basic principles which i thought the committee was considering <e>", "<cs> now we are going round in circles <e> <s> my argument and that of those noble and learned lords and noble lords who support my amendment is precisely the point that the minister is making <e> <s> there are many matters which are within the wording of the relevant provisions which are divorced from which are not calculations of or dependent upon relevant and total expenditure <e> <s> because they are separate and because it is only total or relevant expenditure with which this bill deals they should not be validated if there were errors made by the secretary of state relating to them <e> <s> the minister is saying that for that very reason they should be validated <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down he seems to he saying that the words or after are necessary <e> <s> perhaps he could confirm that the government are saying that <e> <s> why should they be necessary <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning said quite explicitly and in my view rightly that after the passing of the act it is the provisions of the act which will have effect <e> <s> you do not need to say a second time that they will have effect whether the litigation started before or after the passing of the act even if after the passing of the act the court makes a decision which conflicts with the law <e> <s> why does the minister say the words are necessary <e>", "<cs> as i said in my speech on the amendments this is an extremely important clause <e> <s> the provisions relating to validation are outstandingly important <e> <s> they are in particular in subsections and of the clause read together <e> <s> as a result of the other amendments that have been moved the minister has been good enough to agree to look again at some of the wording and so we are in the position that this clause generally will be yet again reviewed or crawled over to use the ministers own term <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister has now identified the legislation because i have more than once said that when i die that title will be found to be blazoned across my heart <e> <s> the distinction between that legislation and the present bill from the point of view of the amendment is that in relation to that legislation there was no advice by the government which caused the local authorities concerned to act illegally <e> <s> there is no analogy at all <e>", "<cs> there is only one point that i wish to raise arising from what the minister said <e> <s> it concerns the relevance or otherwise of clause which provides <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i was surprised to hear the noble baroness resting the departments case on the <e>", "<cs> since i am invited to construe amendment no <e> <s> i should have thought that it is reasonably simple <e> <s> i might possibly have altered the wording slightly in that instead of reading <e>", "<cs> would the minister be good enough to repeat perhaps a little more slowly than he <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> whether he is right or wrong really depends on what exactly he means <e> <s> i am still not very clear about that <e> <s> perhaps i can put it in my language <e> <s> if proceedings are brought seeking as in this case they would be the annulment of a decision and the plaintiff in this case a local authority relies on four grounds it is sufficient for him to succeed on one <e> <s> the fact that he has succeeded on one does not mean that he has either succeeded or failed on the other three <e>", "<cs> i do not intend at this hour to take up much of the time of the committee on clause stand part <e> <s> i rise to draw attention to the fact that although a number of amendments have not been moved on clause because of the narrow defeat on the major amendment of clause that is not to say that those amendments are considered to be wrong <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out a printing error in amendment no <e> <s> no doubt the minister has already had his attention drawn to it <e> <s> the formula set out in amendment no is not in line with the formula as set out in the relevant part of the schedule <e> <s> there is a t which ought not to be there <e> <s> does the minister wish to tell me that he has already observed that error <e>", "<cs> i certainly cannot answer at the moment but i am sure that my noble friends will be looking at that point in order to give an answer <e> <s> as regards amendment no the minister is aware of the error and i assume that nobody has been put in any difficulty as a result <e> <s> perhaps the amendment can be read as not having a t <e> <s> without weakening the force of the speeches of my noble friends and the noble lord lord kilmarnock which all go very much to the merits of these amendments i should like to talk about the extraordinary circumstance resulting from the two letters of rd february sent by the department to the chief executives to which my noble friend lord underhill has already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the probing amendment moved by the noble lord <e> <s> he has drawn attention to what appears to be an extremely important point and one which arises as a direct result of the bills provisions coupled with the fact as has been pointed out that we are not a party to the united nations convention <e>", "<cs> my lords as in the case of the first amendment which was moved by the noble lord lord campbell of croy i am happy to support amendments nos <e> <s> and as probing amendments as they were advanced by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i can particularly support the new clause amendment no <e> <s> because we on this side feel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this discussion and particularly to the noble and learned lords on the cross benches whose speeches have been extremely helpful <e> <s> so far as concerns the speech of the minister on behalf of the government i have to say with all respect to him that there were times when i wondered whether we had emerged from the jungle from which the noble lord lord renton has recently emerged <e> <s> i felt that if the case for this amendment had to be put in so complicated a way nothing that we could put forward to improve the bill could do other than simplify it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to look at one aspect of the matter <e> <s> supposing that we have decisions which are rendered null and void as a result of the validation provision in this bill who will pay for the litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about the costs of litigation which as the noble lord may know can be very heavy <e> <s> indeed in their arguments on amendment no <e> <s> his noble friends rested a good deal of their case on the desirability of not having litigation <e> <s> for all we know we may have had that litigation already and it is rendered of no effect <e> <s> whatever words the minister may wish to use that is the position <e> <s> the local authorities concerned on behalf of their ratepayers will have expended perhaps considerable sums of money <e> <s> i am asking whether or not they are to continue to bear the cost of the litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer one question that occurs to me in that context <e> <s> if a ratepayer of one of the affected authorities having to pay higher rates as a result of the additional expenditure that his authority has incurred because of the errors of the secretary of state or his department should think fit to complain against that situation to the parliamentary commissioner for administration on the grounds that the expenditure has been the result of maladministration not by the local authority but by the government would he not have a good claim <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might say a few words about the speeches of the noble lords lord campbell of alloway and lord renton <e> <s> there are parts of those speeches with which i would not disagree <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that if there are no proper practices then in those circumstances the power to specify would be a perfectly sensible one <e> <s> i would only add in relation to that that if a situation exists in which there are no proper practices then it is wholly unnecessary to put in the governments amendment the provision that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether we could put the question the other way round <e> <s> he is saying that those words are not necessary because they are already inherent in the bill <e> <s> if they are not necessary why does he want to put them in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> surely it must be the province of the secretary of state to inform parliament and local authorities of his view <e> <s> that view will dictate the question of whether in future he will oppose the decision of the court on the ground of no effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not intend to do that and i have no doubt that we shall want to test the matter <e> <s> i was asked what is the purpose of the report <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls made the process of a report by the secretary of state sound a little like passing legislation through all stages of parliament <e> <s> the secretary of state is perfectly well aware today which cases being heard in the courts he regards as being made ineffective or partly ineffective <e> <s> there may be a few more cases between now and the passing of the act but in all probability there will not be <e> <s> if a judge made more <e>", "<cs> my lords has the attention of the noble and learned lord been drawn in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said it is now some years since the labour government of implemented their promise to provide the citizen with a right of redress for injustice suffered in consequence of governmental maladministration <e> <s> at the second reading of the parliamentary commissioner bill on th october my right honourable friend the lord president as he then was made this remark <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for a clear exposition of the position of the government on that matter <e> <s> so far as the latter part of his remarks is concerned he was clearly seized of a point that the amendments do not force the government to include any body <e> <s> we should have to have an order in council that parliament supported <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i accept that <e> <s> but surely the minister would agree with me that the best practice at any rate in relation to a complaint against a government department or one of the new bodies which will be added to the list is for the complaint to go first of all in exactly the same way to that body for a reply <e> <s> it is only if the reply is unsatisfactory in the normal way that a complaint is then made to the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> in the same way as if the reply from the body complained about is unsatisfactory the complaint goes to the health service commissioner direct <e>", "<cs> i listened with very great care to the ministers remarks <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me when i say that of all the points that he made the last was the only one that i found had any great force in it and the question of whether we might be thought to be trespassing on the preserves of a chamber which at the moment has a monopoly rather

amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> let me say a word in support of what the noble lord lord renton has said <e> <s> i do not think it affects the specific point of the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for having indicated the governments acceptance of that which i believe to be right <e> <s> i agree that the court of appeal might very well wish not merely to read what is said in a transcipt but actually to see what the court saw <e> <s> it is something which it does not have the advantage of in the ordinary way but this is different from the ordinary way <e> <s> it seems to me that the government ought to give very careful consideration as to whether there should not be made available to the court of appeal if there should be an appeal what would truly be a video in that context that is a record of what was seen and heard through the closed circuit if this procedure is adopted <e>", "<cs> may i make clear as there has been some uncertainty raised in the debate that this procedure is intended to be ancillary to what has now been described as the closed-circuit television system <e> <s> other procedures which would be adopted in addition if some other system were adopted and i shall be moving an amendment in due course about that are quite different <e> <s> what is proposed here is <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that all noble lords who have been present during this <e>", "<cs> it sometimes felt like hours but i am prepared to accept that i should have said minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words following but not on the same lines as those placed before the house by the noble lord lord lloyd on a question of law to which the minister also referred <e> <s> however i do not think he gave the full explanation which certainly is required <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his undertakings and the way he has accepted the principle of the new clause <e> <s> in the light of those undertakings i am only too pleased to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> the argument about the number of people in prison has been raised and supported by several noble lords <e> <s> there is no need to dwell upon it <e> <s> i agree with what has been said <e> <s> but in addition i support the amendment on other grounds in particular that of consistency <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word or two on the point which has just been made by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the provisions of clause arose in this way <e> <s> it was felt by many that the existing restrictions which were imposed by parliament on sentencing of a custodial nature on young children were being operated in an extremely variable way <e>", "<cs> i have one point of doubt on this particular amendment and perhaps the minister can resolve it <e> <s> it arises partly from what the noble and learned lord lord havers has just said <e> <s> i am not clear as to whether the term weapon which is referrred to in the clause and which governs it includes the type of article which we have been dealing with under the clauses which we have just been discussing <e> <s> on the face of it looking at these clauses as a whole it rather looks as though it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i at least detect that the noble earl and those of us who have put these amendments forward are moving sensibly towards one another <e> <s> i am grateful for the view expressed by the minister that the proviso to subsection meets one of the major points that he put forward on the last occasion <e> <s> the second one is in his view fairly well balanced to the extent that if he were concerned with those two alone he might be prepared to accept the amendment as it stands <e> <s> i understood that to be what he was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one correction in what the minister said <e> <s> subsection of the amendment which i moved has nothing within it which requires a judge to make any decision as to whether the child is in fact truthful <e> <s> the requirement is that the judge should be satisfied that it appears to him that the child is capable of giving truthful evidence which is a very different thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister is right in insisting on the amendment <e> <s> all i want to add is that the argument between the minister and those on the alliance benches may suggest to him that the somewhat softer wording of the amendment which i have withdrawn may be better than the absolute wording of his clause <e> <s> however that is something which he can consider in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also express to the minister the gratitude of the opposition for having taken on board the many criticisms that were made of the original drafting and for coming forward with what i am sure is a very <e>", "<cs> my lords as long ago as it was reported that repeated but unsuccessful efforts had been made to establish public registration something which had been constantly recommended by the ablest lawyers and statesmen <e> <s> however five years later the noble and learned lord the lord

subsection as it will be read with subsection b with which we have just dealt <e> <s> subsection will provide that the inspection is to be available for <e>", "<cs> my lords i have long been of the view that a tenant who wishes to dispose in one way or another of his interest is at a disadvantage which cannot be justified even when the lease creates the form of protection by prohibiting unreasonable refusal to consent to the disposition <e> <s> if the tenant having applied for consent and not received it boldly goes ahead to carry out the disposition he is at risk of forfeiture as is the person to whom he disposes <e> <s> his alternative to seek a declaration is expensive productive of delay and risky <e> <s> the burden of proof of unreasonableness is on the tenant <e> <s> as the noble lord lord meston has pointed out <e> <s> reasonableness is viewed through the eye of the landlord <e> <s> the landlord is not obliged to give reasons in reply to the tenants application for consent or even i think to reply at all <e>", "<cs> and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the list suggests grouping amendments nos <e> <s> and with which i find myself in agreement <e> <s> indeed it is convenient that before amendments nos <e> <s> and are taken amendment no <e> <s> should be considered because they are essentially amendments to the clause and affect amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> of course there is a wide range of people who have experience of the procedure and practice of the courts in addition to barristers clerks and solicitors clerks <e> <s> there are those who have years of experience of working in them in one form or another <e>", "<cs> i found that to be an extremely helpful reply as have been the previous ones <e> <s> we must look at the lines on which the noble and learned lord proposed that the difficulty might be dealt with <e> <s> it may be that we on this side of the committee together with the noble and learned lord will be able to work out the most suitable wording <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would help if i read out the wording of the subsection if the amendment were made <e> <s> it would read <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for explaining in principle <e> <s> it would certainly help me if he could give some explanation of the kind of difference that he has in mind <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor might spend a little time considering this with his advisers <e> <s> if he has any example to give beyond what he has already said perhaps he could let me know <e> <s> i am grateful for his reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that reply and in the light of it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who seems to have understood the problem here a bit more clearly than i expressed it <e> <s> i agree with him that any form of words will not be easy to formulate to encompass what we both have in mind <e> <s> perhaps if we can both think about it we may be able to come up with something <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we certainly thought it quite appropriate to raise the issue under the duties of the board <e> <s> it will be for the board to decide whether in its opinion one of the conditions of precedent which are set out in paragraphs i to v arise <e> <s> that would be a function of the board entirely consistent with its general function of deciding whether there should be representation or advice in other cases <e>", "<cs> at this hour of the night i would not think of seeking to test the opinion of the committee <e> <s> however we may wish to return to this matter at a later stage perhaps with a better drafted amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lords objections seem to be largely devoted to the wording of the amendment and to particular parts of it although the white paper is much more robust in opposing the general concept of extension <e> <s> however we shall consider that issue <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation and in the light of it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the last point made by the noble and learned lord is correct because the phrase always eligible therefore has been inserted into the amendment in order to cover that point <e> <s> it may be that it does not do so and if so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken on this quite important amendment and particularly to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his speech in which he recognised that there are problems <e> <s> he wishes to go much further than my amendment in looking to possible solutions to those problems <e> <s> let me say to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham that whatever the historical basis of the first charge it does not seem to me to alter the position <e> <s> that makes it difficult for me at any rate <e> <s> to accept the validity of the distinction which provides that an assisted persons dwelling-house clothes household furniture and the tools of his trade are not to be taken into account in assessing his financial resources and are not to be subject to execution but that all of those items are to be taken into account when it comes to the payment of costs out of property which has been received recovered or preserved <e> <s> logically it seems to me that if you disallow one there is good ground for disallowing the other <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am disappointed by the reply given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on this matter <e> <s> i am not very sure whether the new provision which enables an unassisted person to make submissions to the legal aid committee affects the matter one way or the other or if it does whether it supports the view of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor or the view put forward by those of us who have proposed this amendment <e> <s> i am not sure what the effect will be <e> <s> it is clear from what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor himself said that there will still be cases in which the legal aid authorities will grant legal aid and indeed may adhere to the grant even in the face of representations from the other party if such representations can properly be made <e> <s> at the end of the day the assisted person will fail <e> <s> it is that sort of case that we have in mind <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that indication from the noble and learned lord and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps he could explain the reference in the bill to section <e> <s> is that simply what one might call a paving provision for this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation <e> <s> he will probably accept that that was a mouthful to assimilate at this late hour <e> <s> perhaps i may look at what has been said in <e>", "<cs> i am quite content to follow that advice <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
