["<cs> my lords as this is the first time that i have spoken from this side of the house i hope the house will forgive me if i take this opportunty to congratulate the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal on his appointment <e> <s> i envy him <e> <s> he has received his appointment within the best of departments <e> <s> i believe that the ministry of defence is the most dedicated and the most efficient of the great departments of state <e> <s> to be a defence minister is one of the sweetest of the sweets of office <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord newall for introducing this debate <e> <s> his speech was factual cogent and short and these are virtues in speaking which this house appreciates <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that the policy of deterrence has worked over the last thirty years and will continue to work if we are sufficiently resolute <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has already expressed its gratitude to the noble earl lord kimberley for initiating this debate <e> <s> i can only express the hope that many thousands of individuals may benefit from his initiative <e> <s> i suppose the government would argue that the statute of limitations should apply to this particular situation <e> <s> i know how troublesome ancient wrongs are to governments but the people who have been wronged are still alive <e> <s> they were young when they were released from imprisonment they faced life with enthusiasm and hope they are now getting old <e> <s> any assistance that they can be given at this stage in their life recognising the service that they have performed for their country even in servitude can only bring credit to the government of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i wish to congratulate the noble baroness lady white for having initiated this debate <e> <s> i should also like to say that i am not one of her conscripts i am only a volunteer and as such i hope that a volunteers contribution will be measured accordingly <e> <s> i was in touch with the general intellectual discussions and studies which took place up to about five years ago but from that time on i have lost touch <e> <s> but listening to todays debate i feel that all the questions we were asking then are being asked today and we are being given a chance to try to answer to those questions <e> <s> i have only two questions to put to the noble earl who is to reply and they relate to the cost of the project and to the cost of the studies <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak very shortly on this subject and i wish to make only three points <e> <s> first one of the areas of discussion which i find quite mystifying is the distinction that so many people make in that they consider the effects of nuclear weapons appalling while at the same time they accept conventional weapons as something with which we can all live <e> <s> that strikes me as one of the main fallacies behind the argument of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney who seems to have left the chamber for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only saying that lenin himself had a very clear view on this <e> <s> he talked about the army of useful fools who were to be used for this purpose <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord to the fact that the army of useful fools has been mobilised for this operation <e>", "<cs> my lords my russian is not very good but lenin said that he could depend upon the army of useful fools for operations which would serve the purposes of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house is most grateful to the noble earl lord kimberley for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue <e> <s> he and my noble friend lord mulley have put into the picture the basic arguments within the framework that we have to consider <e> <s> may i add a little point from my past experience when i was private secretary to the minister in the house of lords in <e> <s> i apologise for keeping your lordships at this unconscionably late hour and therefore i shall make only three points in relation to this debate <e> <s> the first point is this <e> <s> it is a british design that we are talking about <e> <s> anybody can make an aeroplane if they have a design for it there are no problems there <e> <s> after all we are talking about a brazilian designed aircraft and a swiss designed aircraft <e> <s> we know that a great many people throughout the world are designing aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to speak with the professional expertise of the noble lord lord pitt or from personal experience as did the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth but i want to make one point which i do not think has been stressed this evening and which i believe is of importance in simple terms of administration <e> <s> i have been encouraged to speak tonight by a friend of mine who is a doctor in a four-member group practice in a remote part of england <e> <s> it provides an admirable service looking after many people spread over a wide area even extending into wales <e> <s> because they work over a very large area they have their own dispensing facilities <e> <s> the medicine is provided in such a way that the patient drops in one day and gets his medicines the next <e>", "<cs> my lords let me declare an interest in that i am chairman of a small housing association <e> <s> the association is young small and innovative <e> <s> i should be grateful to your lordships if you would permit me to give a brief history of its first years which leads up to a question which i wish to put to the minister about the strength which the government are proposing to place behind sections and of the housing association act <e> <s> those two sections have the rubrics <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was preparing myself to speak today i was somewhat concerned by the number of maiden speakers <e> <s> i was not certain then in what order they would speak and whether or not i was to follow them <e> <s> fortunately whoever is responsible for deciding the batting order of speakers has enabled me to listen to all three maiden speakers and to congratulate all of them on the very interesting contributions they have made to this debate <e> <s> in particular this has enabled me on behalf of the whole house to congratulate the noble viscount lord oxfuird on his speech <e> <s> i have a special reason for saying that <e> <s> first it is probable that we shall become neighbours in the not too distant future <e> <s> secondly i think that what i have to say will be in harmony with the philosophy he has expressed this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest in this subject although it is not quite the obvious one <e> <s> in the month of march i was approached by a group of individuals from the far east who had substantial funds which they wished to invest in this country <e> <s> fortunately i did not have to use my brain for very long because the under-secretary of state at the department of energy mr michael spicer made the first indication of the governments immediate intention to privatise the electricity industry <e> <s> this preceded the white paper or the semi green paper by a week or two <e> <s> this prompted me to suggest to the gentlemen who came to see me that they should study the possibility of investing some of their funds in the privatisation of the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the chairman of a small housing association <e> <s> it is for that reason that i only recently took advice to speak today <e> <s> i have come today more to learn than to impart information <e> <s> i look forward to reading the wisdom and knowledge of my colleagues when the debate has finished <e> <s> however i have several points to make <e>"]
