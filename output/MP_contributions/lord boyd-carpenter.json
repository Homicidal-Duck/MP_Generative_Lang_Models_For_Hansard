["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend indicate what amount of the large total figure which he gave represents payment to compensate for the operating deficit of the industry and what proportion that amount is of the total earnings of the industry for that period <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend indicate how long a resident of hillingdon has to spend abroad before he can return through the airport and claim as an immigrant priority on the hillingdon housing list <e>", "<cs> may i take up the point that the noble lord opposite raised as to the drafting of the last but one line of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i assumed when i read it that there was a misprint and the word not had been left out <e> <s> we were told by the noble baroness in charge of the amendment that this was intended <e> <s> with respect this is a ludicrous provision to put into any legislation <e> <s> five minutes in-service training would it seems to me fully <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness who moved the amendment said with frankness that it was moved in the interests of the local authorities <e> <s> no doubt it isbut by the same token it is an amendment which if adopted would affect prejudicially the rights of parents inasmuch as it would limit the area in respect of which they can express a preference <e> <s> i therefore take the view that it would have an adverse effect on the rights of parents and i am therefore very much against an amendment which would have that effect <e>", "<cs> much as i would love it i think that to give the noble lord a lecture on many clauses of of the act would mean that the noble lord might find himself inclined towards taking his dinner before i had finished <e> <s> i am saying that the bill as it stands seems to me to be satisfactory to deal with the situation <e> <s> i would bring the noble lord and the committee back to the point that it is the noble baroness on the front bench there who wishes to alter that which seems to me to be the satisfactory position of the law as it will be if the bill becomes an act in its present form <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has challenged me in his usual agreeable way <e> <s> as he himself said earlier i certainly have no wish to lose my temper with him <e> <s> he referred to the perfectly accurate fact that i did not take part in the debates in this house on mrs shirley williams infamous bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is asking me to make a speech on selection he knows that he is dangling temptation in front of me <e> <s> from a wider point of view i rather suspect his motives because when is the snare set in sight of the bird <e> <s> may i remind him of a fact which he and mrs shirley williams were quite unable to rebutthat whatever the merits or demerits of selection we could go on about that all night but i do not propose to do so the fact remains that in certain parts of the country where selection was practised the local authorities responsible for that were consistently returned to office and power and responsibility at every local authority election <e> <s> the real argument which mrs shirley williams and he never faced was why education authority areas who wished to continue this system should be denied the right to do so by the legislative blunderbuss of a declining government <e>"]
