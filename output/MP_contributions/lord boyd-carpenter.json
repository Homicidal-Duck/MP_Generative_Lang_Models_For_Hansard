["<cs> my lords it is a pleasure as well as a privilege to be given by chance the first opportunity of congratulating the noble lord lord miles on a triumphant first night <e> <s> his speech was a fascinating one <e> <s> your lordships have been disagreeing this afternoon and will continue to disagree about a great many things but i would feel that we must be unanimous in saying what pleasure it gave to all of us to listen to that speech with the very wide scope that it had with the charm which exuded from it and the clarity of thought which illumined it <e> <s> it is most encouraging to think that after a triumphant first night a whole series of further performances is to be hoped for <e> <s> we have all had a great privilege this afternoon and i certainly for my part enjoyed it enormously <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must be a mind reader because that was precisely the point i was coming to with particular reference to the noble lord lord byers although he does not appear to be in the chamber at the moment <e> <s> i think the answer to the noble lords perfectly fair point is this first of all the high penal rates at the top end of the scale are wholly unjustifiable in themselves and the rectification of them does not necessarily involve justifying rectification of other less serious imposts at other levels <e> <s> secondly and this is far more important tax levels like that on key people damage the economy as a whole and therefore damage the interests of all <e> <s> if able men insist on working abroad because abroad they are entitled to keep a larger proportion of what they earn they do not suffer <e> <s> they may indeed benefit <e> <s> it is the community as a whole which suffers <e> <s> it is the people earning much smaller rates of pay lower down the scale who perhaps suffer the blow of unemployment and who certainly suffer from the reduced strength of the national economy <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend at least give an assurance that no aid is now being given to vietnam <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that lengthy reply and wish him well on his journey to tokyo <e> <s> may i ask whether he has reason to believe that the efforts which her majestys present advisers are making to relieve this really quite intolerable situation are likely to be more successful than those of the previous government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> first why in view of the long lapse of time since the acas appeal failed has taxation taken place so slowly <e> <s> secondly in the meanwhile will my noble friend and the government exercise their benign influence to restrain acas from plunging into further expensive and unsuccessful litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer can my noble friend say whether the installation in question is a safeguarded or an unsafe-guarded one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he able to reassure me that priority will be given to this issue in the review to which he referred first in the light of the clear expression of view by the responsible and senior committee in another place and secondly because at the end of the last parliament the sum of million was granted to this body to deal with by the last statute to get her majestys assent before the dissolution <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that the anxieties which have been widely expressed this afternoon are certainly not diminished by the published statement of the chairman of this body that responsibility to ministers is equivalent to responsibility to parliament <e> <s> is there not a very strong case that a body so headed should be subject to the most rigid parliamentary scrutiny on the money it has already spent whatever its future may be <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord also recall that that government of which he was a distinguished member which he so extols ended in a disastrous balance of payments <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> so were you <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think that what he is really trying to tell the house is that i did not deploy any of the points to which his office had <e>", "<cs> my lords the million alleged against the government was in respect of a whole year <e> <s> the million for this year is in respect for four months <e>", "<cs> my lords those of your lordships who were present at the beginning of this debate may recall that i indicated that when we reached this stage i would seek your lordships permission to withdraw the motion <e> <s> in a moment i shall seek to do that <e> <s> however before doing so i hope that i may be allowed to say that i very much hope that the house as a whole feels as i do that we have had a debate of very considerable value <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to interrupt <e> <s> it is important <e> <s> this is the same question as was asked by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that point i wonder whether he would consider this <e> <s> personally i have sympathy with his doubts about another body but will my noble friend give consideration to selecting an experienced individual such as sir peter masefield who given a small staff could take a quick and independent view of this system <e> <s> my noble friend knows as well as i do that when one is running a system everybody becomes wedded to it and a little conservative <e> <s> sometimes the wholly independent judgment of somebody with experience and i have suggested off-the-cuff sir peter masefield can throw up possible improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer and for the courteous and helpful letter which he sent me may i ask him whether none the less he would accept that there are many people who feel it is quite wrong despite the difficulty caused by the commitment of the previous government to continue putting the money of the british taxpayer into the hands of this gang of genocidal murderers <e> <s> would it not be better to stop the flow to that government and use what resources are available to help their victims the refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be prepared to answer my last supplementary question as to whether the government have considered diverting the remaining payments from the government of vietnam notwithstanding the latters undertaking not to murder its fellow subjects for a few weeks to the refugees <e> <s> could not for example these ships be sold and the funds made available for that humanitarian purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask another question <e> <s> as my noble friend knows hovercraft are treated in law partly as ships and partly as aircraft <e> <s> is it the intention of the railways board in making these by-laws to consult in advance the civil aviation authority so as to secure that there is no clash between the two jurisdictions <e>", "<cs> it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very great knowledge of the noble lord lord mccarthy on these subjects it is a little surprising that he made a most strenuous attempt to blow up the debate on the modest adjustments involved in these two orders into great issues of principle <e> <s> as i see it no question of principle arises <e> <s> let us take first the qualifying period <e> <s> if one listened to some parts of the noble lords speech the logical conclusion one would draw is that there should be no qualifying period at all <e> <s> but under the government which he supported the -week period operated and there was no suggestion at that time that there should be no qualifying period the -week period was accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord cannot duck the issue quite so blatantly as that <e> <s> there was nothing to prevent the government which he supported if they thought all qualifying periods were wrong legislating in their habitual happy way generally under the guillotine to put through an amendment to the law <e> <s> they very wisely did not do so because in their day if the noble lord will allow me to say so they were wiser in this matter than the noble lord himself <e> <s> the same applies in the change from a - to -day period as i was saying when the noble lord sought to assist me <e> <s> that is a modest adjustment some may think it is too modest within the existing framework <e> <s> i believe that there is a very good reason at least for making these two adjustments at this stage although it may well be that experience will show that her majestys government ought to go further certainly in respect of the qualifying period <e>", "<cs> the axe of damocles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that wholly satisfactory reply <e> <s> may i ask him to confirm what i think is his implication namely that if either as a result of the current review of the london airports or for other reasons at any time during the subsequent years while the government will no doubt be in office they will regard themselves as wholly free to direct the british airports authority to construct a second runway if in the judgment of the government it is required <e>", "<cs> my noble friend i think misunderstood my question <e> <s> i did not ask him to confirm what the government would do i asked him to confirm that the government could if they so wished give such a direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether that legislation will deal with the current guidance issued by the previous government which as my noble friend knows had a large hole torn in it by the admirable decision of the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i then ask my noble friend in thanking him for that reply whether although the delay occasioned by this long and probably unnecessary inquiry is not the responsibility of the government the government are aware of the fact that the building of this terminal is grossly overdue and that in any event there will be very serious congestion indeed at heathrow next summer <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the terms of that answer however admirable in themselves do not indicate any feeling on the part of her majestys government that there is other than great urgency also to build this terminal as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by offering an apology to your lordships for the fact that a long-standing engagement involving persons a great deal more eminent than myself will mean that unless the debate proceeds to the length which on a pessimistic view the number of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i owe the noble baroness an apology <e> <s> i tried to explain a moment ago why i used that expression <e> <s> if i have failed to convey this clearly i will attempt to do so again <e> <s> i spelled out the fact that they will result in reduction of certain expenditures but that overall they will result in and i recall that i used the expression the stabilisation of expenditure at the level which the government which she supported carried on <e> <s> to describe such an overall financial operation as cuts without some qualifying adjective seems to me to be misleading and likely to confuse those people and there may be some outside who are not wholly aware of exactly what it is that is being done <e> <s> i hope that i have made that clear to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords my doubt is whether the cuts go far enough and whether there ought not to be real cuts <e> <s> the world economic situation is gloomy there is a real need for reductions in the tax burden and i wonder whether these cuts go as far as the economic situation justifies <e> <s> of course i know the governments problem <e> <s> as i have told the house i have been through this before <e> <s> no governments impose cuts if they can help it <e> <s> it is unpleasant and an unpopular thing to do and naturally governments seek to avoid it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> and declare what i am sorry to say is unhappily a minute interest in the company concerned <e> <s> in view of the fact that possession of the property has passed may i ask him why discussions on compensation are not even started after this interval of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the post office be better engaged at attempting to halt the decline in the standard of its services and the increasing charge for them rather than indulging in action of this kind which must cause quite a lot of alarm and despondency to all sorts of humble people who have not the faintest idea what it is all about <e>", "<cs> but can my noble friend explain my lords how the delivery of this leaflet at a house which does not have a telephone can allay rather than generate alarm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask him to confirm what i think is implicit in it namely that her majestys government appreciate the very real burden particularly on small firms involved in the compilation of elaborate statistical returns <e> <s> may i ask him further whether he will invite his right honourable friend the minister of agriculture to cease to demand from very small farmers or market gardeners the completion of immense forms demanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him why if it be necessary to produce in the community more butter than can be sold at an economic price it is necessary to sell this butter at subsidised prices to russia with the consequence that they have of course more resources available for guns <e> <s> would it not be better if this butter has to be disposed of that it should go to the victims of communist imperialism in kampuchea <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend add to that answer by telling the house what were the arguments which his right honourable friends european colleagues used for this quite extraordinary decision as to the disposal of the butter to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords does not what my noble friend so well said earlier about the organisational difficulties involved in interposing the board of the neb between the board of a large company and a department apply equally and perhaps indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend with equal succinctness tell me whether the boundary commission is free to consider and is considering the disparity at present between the size of constituencies in england and northern ireland on the one hand and scotland and wales on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that our noble friend is right in the suggestion that the public inquiry at gatwick is voluntary that is to say there is no legal necessity to hold it <e> <s> if that is so why is it being held and how much will it cost <e> <s> and is my noble friend aware <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend observed that in his question the noble lord opposite has bracketed tax evasion with tax avoidance <e> <s> will my noble friend make it clear that there is a great distinction between the one which is unlawful and the other which the courts have constantly ruled is wholly lawful <e> <s> if my noble friend prompted by the noble lord opposite is looking for examples of tax evasion will he look at some of the practices of the printing unions in fleet street <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that some months ago the government published a white paper a major feature of which was the policy decision to develop gatwick airport up to a level capable of handling million passengers a year <e> <s> on the basis of that policy is not at least a second terminal inevitably required and on that basis is not therefore a public inquiry a waste of time and public money and really no more than a work creation scheme for the planning bar <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend envisage carrying out the declared policy of the government which they are already pursuing by ordering foreign airlines to move to gatwick other than by deciding after all this inquiry is over that a second terminal has to be built <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> when he referred to mr christopher <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord forgotten also prisoners serving long-term sentences <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down to take part in the debate but i desire to speak very briefly simply to make three points <e> <s> first as the father of a serving soldier with a highly independent daughter-in-law i should like to thank the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for bringing the bill to us and for dealing with what he is quite right in saying is a grievance among those wives of serving personnel who take their civic duties seriously and there are many such people <e> <s> secondly i should like to congratulate the author of the bill in another place my old friend mr cranley onslow who suffered inadvertently from being misnamed <e> <s> he was responsible for taking the bill through another place and if i may say so most appropriately because in another place he represents a constituency inhabited probably by more members of the armed forces than is any other in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that very comprehensive reply may i ask him two questions <e> <s> the first is whether in view of the grave and deteriorating situation at heathrow he can explain why so long a time seven months if my mathematics are right has elapsed since the report was received without any public action being taken on it <e> <s> secondly in view of the urgency of the situation can my noble friend now give any indication of the earliest date by which this terminal could be completed in order to help cope with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm as i believe he can from his own experience that this is now a very urgent matter <e> <s> can he also indicate that seven months is not the normal time required to procure <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the unhappy as i think we all feel it to be outcome of this experiment has tended to confirm the anxieties which many of us in industry who are interested in forwarding employee participation have felt about this expedient of so-called worker-directors <e> <s> has it confirmed-which is our anxiety the suggestion that the trade union-nominated or employee-nominated worker-director is exposed to a very difficult clash of loyalties in deciding whether his first loyalty is to the union to the employees who nominated him or to the board of the company on which he is serving <e> <s> can the noble viscount say whether this experiment has thrown any light on that which many of us think is the basic difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friend and is not the foreign office a little concerned if this oil-rich country can help itself to british property and put forward no proposals for compensation for six months that this may be a considerable encouragement to other countries where there are british investments to behave similarly <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that he used this argument about the new government two and a half months ago <e> <s> is he therefore aware that it is now two and a half months older <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of my noble friends frequently demonstrated capacity to solve the insoluble is it not possible to persuade the present spanish government to abandon this last remaining relic of the policy of the late unlamented general franco and to persuade them to understand that no british government could conceivably trade away the rights and wishes of people who have stood up to blockade for years in their determination to be british <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> might it not assist consideration of this sensitive matter if it could also be indicated to the young athletes in question that while no one would advocate putting physical barriers in the way of their attending these games if they want even in moscow they might feel themselves in an unhappy position parading before and receiving the plaudits of a government whose troops are engaged in aggression in several parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact as history shows that whatever the position of the olympic committee to which my noble friends attention has been drawn by our noble friend the host country almost always treats the games as a major public relations exercise <e> <s> was this not particularly so when the games were last held in a dictatorship country in berlin in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to say so the quotation from winston churchill was from what he said in <e>", "<cs> my lords when a little more than seven hours ago i opened this debate i expressed the view that this house could muster on this subject a greater body of experience and knowledge than any other legislative chamber in the world <e> <s> whatever else this debate has demonstrated i think that it has established that and having heard virtually all the speeches made during this debate i am sure that it has been an exceedingly impressive one <e> <s> if as my noble friend suggests it is read in the kremlin i would not like to answer for the consequences <e> <s> indeed i found my noble friends suggestion that our debates are regularly read there somewhat alarming in view of the recent trends of russian foreign policy <e> <s> i hope that he was not suggesting that we had any responsibility for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply and expressing the hope that he will send me a copy may i have an assurance that no action will be taken by her majestys government to increase the permitted weight or size of road vehicles until there has been full opportunity to discuss the substance of this very important technical report <e>", "<cs> my lords without under-rating sir arthur armi <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the local insurance officer who determines these matters himself a quasi-judicial authority in this and other matters <e> <s> moreover does not the smallness of the numbers to which the noble lord referred confirm the experience of many of us who have been involved in matters of national insurance administration that local insurance officers are singularly unwilling to take action in these cases unless they are absolutely blatant <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the most effective method of reducing consumption to be found in the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very glad that my noble friend lord trefgarne when he opened this debate paid a tribute to our late noble friend lord thomas who as he said and lord thomas said this to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never in my life used that appalling description of a human being as an economic unit and i repudiate the suggestion with all the vigour of which i am capable <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a parody <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me to say so does it not follow that if the government in the light of the inspectors report or for any other reason dropped the proposed second terminal at gatwick the present policy of diversion of traffic from heathrow to gatwick would be in ruins <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves this runway question i asked him he is very conscientious in replying and no doubt he overlooked it why if the secretary of states statement sets out so clearly that if passenger movements at stansted go above million it is necessary to provide the possibility of a second runway it is still thought that you can operate up to million passengers a year at gatwick on only one <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that a number of local authorities have been far more zealous in reducing the services they give to the community than in reducing the numbers of their employees <e>", "<cs> the abolition of the price commission which i welcome raises two issues <e> <s> first there is the issue which the noble lord lord robbins raised as to whether any system of price control any instrument for seeking to regulate prices is likely to be either effective or beneficial <e> <s> i take the view i will not weary your lordships with it at any length that save in the most exceptional circumstances such as a war-time situation such a system on the whole is inefficient and does more harm than good creates a black market and damages the profitability of industry <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to tell the noble lord although it might perhaps almost rank as a commercial <e> <s> i manufacture cement <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that under the previous administration officials published recommendations without any authority from the relevant ministers so to publish <e>", "<cs> so it was with the authority of the minister <e>", "<cs> exactly <e>", "<cs> although as the noble lord lord airedale has rightly said the atmosphere has now cooled may i none the less put to the noble lord lord jacques because i think it is only courteous to him that he <e>", "<cs> i should not like my noble friend lord harmer-nicholls to think that the view he has expressed is unanimous on these benches <e> <s> it is one of the easiest things in the world for a minister and many of us have done it to avoid a division by saying we will think about it <e> <s> it means another amendment at the report stage <e> <s> but in truth the ministerial mind is almost certainly made up <e> <s> i differ from my noble friend in thinking that it is that which derogates from parliamentary procedure <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will allow me to say so my memory had gone back a year to a number of ministers and i will not name them in the previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend indicate what amount of the large total figure which he gave represents payment to compensate for the operating deficit of the industry and what proportion that amount is of the total earnings of the industry for that period <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend indicate how long a resident of hillingdon has to spend abroad before he can return through the airport and claim as an immigrant priority on the hillingdon housing list <e>", "<cs> may i take up the point that the noble lord opposite raised as to the drafting of the last but one line of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i assumed when i read it that there was a misprint and the word not had been left out <e> <s> we were told by the noble baroness in charge of the amendment that this was intended <e> <s> with respect this is a ludicrous provision to put into any legislation <e> <s> five minutes in-service training would it seems to me fully <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness who moved the amendment said with frankness that it was moved in the interests of the local authorities <e> <s> no doubt it isbut by the same token it is an amendment which if adopted would affect prejudicially the rights of parents inasmuch as it would limit the area in respect of which they can express a preference <e> <s> i therefore take the view that it would have an adverse effect on the rights of parents and i am therefore very much against an amendment which would have that effect <e>", "<cs> much as i would love it i think that to give the noble lord a lecture on many clauses of of the act would mean that the noble lord might find himself inclined towards taking his dinner before i had finished <e> <s> i am saying that the bill as it stands seems to me to be satisfactory to deal with the situation <e> <s> i would bring the noble lord and the committee back to the point that it is the noble baroness on the front bench there who wishes to alter that which seems to me to be the satisfactory position of the law as it will be if the bill becomes an act in its present form <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has challenged me in his usual agreeable way <e> <s> as he himself said earlier i certainly have no wish to lose my temper with him <e> <s> he referred to the perfectly accurate fact that i did not take part in the debates in this house on mrs shirley williams infamous bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is asking me to make a speech on selection he knows that he is dangling temptation in front of me <e> <s> from a wider point of view i rather suspect his motives because when is the snare set in sight of the bird <e> <s> may i remind him of a fact which he and mrs shirley williams were quite unable to rebutthat whatever the merits or demerits of selection we could go on about that all night but i do not propose to do so the fact remains that in certain parts of the country where selection was practised the local authorities responsible for that were consistently returned to office and power and responsibility at every local authority election <e> <s> the real argument which mrs shirley williams and he never faced was why education authority areas who wished to continue this system should be denied the right to do so by the legislative blunderbuss of a declining government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he does not feel that it is tragic that there should be this substantial number of vacancies in these important services at the same time as there is a substantial number unemployed particularly young people <e> <s> will he ask the department of employment and in particular their local offices who seem to be somewhat tepid in the matter to show more energy in inviting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that my noble friends right honourable friend has final and reserve powers in this matter <e> <s> on the merits of the case is my noble friend aware of the fact that these enormous vehicles many of them not coming to london but simply passing through between the midlands and the docks congest the traffic of central london to a quite unacceptable degree particularly during the rush hour <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend draw his right honourable friends attention to the fact that such progressively run cities as paris and rome have for some time operated restrictions of this kind <e> <s> if the glc are really not prepared to move will not the government do so <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have just seen an example of the advantages of legal representation in the admirable way in which a thoroughly bad case was argued by a distinguished member of that profession <e> <s> i would only like to say this in reply to the noble baroness on the front bench <e> <s> not every parent is capable of bringing out the merits of the case he may have <e> <s> not every parent is capable of giving a coherent statement or a statement that can be sufficiently succinct to command the attention of a committee <e> <s> i think to deny them as the amendment would the right to be represented would be a mistake which in certain circumstances could cause injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the exemplary conduct of the military personnel concerned from general ackland downwards are the government favourably considering the grant of a rhodesia medal to all who took part <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply and for the extremely courteous and informative letter that he sent me may i ask whether he can confirm that the per cent <e> <s> target can be claimed to have been achieved only if the base line taken is the planned level of expenditure during the preceding year rather than the actual outturn <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and its somewhat metaphysical nature <e> <s> however does it not follow that in terms of actually increasing the provision for national defence which is the spirit of our undertaking to nato there has not been the full per cent <e> <s> increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that extremely interesting reply may i ask him whether the consumer council has made representations to the government on the subject of consumer representation in respect of water authorities <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend answer the question that my noble friend lord drumalbyn has just put to him <e> <s> has he already taken legal advice as to whether the kind of escape clause which he outlined would be <e>", "<cs> my lords have her majestys government or the government of saudi arabia received any expression of regret from the television company concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell made such an agreeable personal reference to mehe is such an artist in doing that because it so disarms a counter-attackthat i am glad that i can begin by expressing agreement with at any rate one thing that he said <e> <s> at the beginning of his speech he said that this was not the type of bill which called for much discussion in detail on second reading <e> <s> i agree with him that as the bill contains a number of clauses important in themselves but not necessarily directly related to each other it is a bill that calls for more detailed discussion in committee and for fairly brief speeches on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the language of government <e> <s> the noble lord lord gordon-walker who of course was closer to the late aneurin bevan says the religion of socialism <e> <s> i thank him for that it makes it rather more telling <e> <s> i am infinitely obliged <e> <s> i shall not confess that i cast a line over him <e> <s> it is the language of government <e> <s> we must sort out the prioritiesabove all in a social security department <e> <s> even in the macmillan era the minister then responsible had to look at priorities concentrate on the most important and cut back on those less clamant in their demands <e> <s> as i see it that is what this bill does <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble lord to consult the con servative party manifesto my lords which unhappily i do not have on me at the moment i do not actually carry it about <e> <s> i think it made it abundantly clear as did the speeches of the prime minister <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord on the bench opposite whether he will clarify a little what he intends to be the effect of the amendment <e> <s> let us take the case touched upon by the noble lord who has just resumed his seat of a union that has no rules in respect of ballots <e> <s> the question i wish to ask the noble lord opposite is whether it is his intention and the intended effect of the amendment that in the case of such a union the clause simply would not operate but would be excluded <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> can he amplify that a little <e> <s> does that mean that where a ballot is not contrary to union rules but the subject is simply not <e>", "<cs> i found the speech of the noble lord who has just sat down much more reassuring in his attitude towards ballots than that of the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord mccarthy purports to be speaking for the trade union movement <e> <s> i think he does because on several occasions he observed that he knew much more about trade unions than anybody else <e> <s> no doubt therefore he claims to be speaking with some authority <e> <s> but if he is he might like to know what effect his speech had on at any rate one member of this committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how glad i was to hear the noble earls tribute to the noble lord lord robens <e> <s> i happen over many years to have seen some of the noble lords work quiet unostentatious enormously effective in the cause of good industrial relations in this country <e> <s> it is right that from that box at this stage of our proceedings my noble friend should put on record the great debt that this house and the country owe to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sure most of your lordships would be in warm agreement with the general spirit of the speech of the noble lord lord shinwell and if he will allow me to say so it must be a unique contribution coming from someone who was an active trade unionist before the act of <e> <s> i doubt whether we shall have any other contributions in this house and certainly not in another place based on so prolonged an experience and if he will allow me to say so on such a spirit of warm human generosity as the noble lord so often shows <e>", "<cs> will my noble and learned friend amplify that a little <e> <s> how would he apply that principle to the case where the man is not already in employment but is seeking employment in a closed shop industry and therefore membership of a union <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord give way <e> <s> on this point of the threat of unemployment if the matter proceeds in the case of a man already in work as he has outlined this certainly would be an alleviation <e> <s> but would he explain how this helps the man such as a former constituent of mine who was denied a job solely because the union in a closed shop situation would not admit him to membership <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> i must confess that i was less than happy over my noble and learned friends reply <e> <s> indeed if i may say so i had the impression that he was not happy about it either but i may have misjudged him <e> <s> it is an issue of great and growing importance with the fairly modern tendency of professional people to become enrolled in trade unions <e> <s> it was probably not a very serious problem at the time of the act and i wonder whether it has been looked at afresh in present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness for that interesting reply <e> <s> may i ask her for an assurance that her majestys government with their concern for the interests of the taxpayer and the ratepayer will take whatever steps are necessary to prevent those people from being mulcted to the extent of million simply because under the system bequeathed to the government an eminent academic was not very strong in mathematics <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the question of the noble lord opposite will my noble friend bear in mind that it would be very depressing if a profession responsible for the education of our children appeared willing to take advantage of a technical error in an assessment procedure and to seek to rely on that simply because an error had been made <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord mccarthy will feel able to reply to the very serious argument which has just been addressed to him from behind him because i think he will find that in most sections of the committee there is much sympathy for the view so characteristically courageously expressed by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord is good enough to ask me the question let me say that i have read it <e>", "<cs> i am glad i have the noble baroness with me <e> <s> to which the other lady present says you mean because they may one day lead the government <e> <s> to which the reply comes no because one day they may lead the opposition <e> <s> the clegg commission was set up in those last few weeks after the unhappy winter of discontent with terms of reference which seemed to indicate a desire as i think the composition of the commission itself indicated to take the heat out of a good many of the claims being made by deferring settlements to a later stage <e> <s> this is an expedient which governments have practised before and will probably practise again <e> <s> it has in fact worked very much in that way and certainly the present administration had as a result bequeathed to it a number of very substantial wage and salary increases in the public sector to the acceptance of which they had been committed by the acts of the previous administration both in setting up clegg and in referring these matters to it <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course <e>", "<cs> and my lords it supplies the material in the form that it thinks is most helpful to the negotiating bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords that was certainly my experience <e> <s> the noble lords experience is perhaps more recent than mine <e> <s> i would ask him to accept that i had two periods of dealing with this operation and it may be that under his benign rule the system developed <e> <s> however certainly at the time when i was involved the material was as he said supplied but supplied by people whose job it was to help the negotiators with a proper supply of information <e> <s> i am sorry if the system did not operate in that way when he was concerned <e> <s> indeed if it did not operate like that with him then perhaps that accounts for some of the rather unfortunate settlements which were made at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord address himself at this interesting point in his speech to the situation created by inflation with the enormous increase resulting from that in the value of the indexed pension payable at <e> <s> would he also address himself to the fact that at the time of the various royal commissions to which he referred that situation did not exist in any substantial degree and that her majestys government have now to deal with the situation as it is with that enormous difference in favour of the public service as against practically anybody in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will agree that this has been a significant debate of very great value if only for the most admirable speech admirable in its robust frankness of my noble friend the lord president <e> <s> equally if i may be allowed without presumption to say so the debate has been greatly distinguished by the speech of the noble lord lord vaizey and it was particularly agreeable to me to hear a speech by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby from the box opposite <e> <s> i was only sorry to hear him say that his tenure of that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply does he accept that the urgency of the matter is very much related to the onset of the holiday season and the fact that considerable numbers of our fellow countrymen will be likely to be attempting to use this airport <e> <s> is it not apparent from the statement which he himself repeated in this house that had there been surveillance radar to assist the air traffic controllers at this airport <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but will my noble friend from his own very considerable practical experience <e>", "<cs> my lords has it not been demonstrated not least by sir freddie laker that the best method of keeping air fares down is the introduction of more competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that moderately encouraging reply may i ask what are the practical steps necessary for opening a gate in some barbed wire <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to assure him that some of us think this is a most admirable provision in the bill <e> <s> one of the problems with recruiting for the armed forces is that service in the forces deprives the serviceman and sometimes his family of advantages which otherwise come in the ordinary way of life to those not so serving <e> <s> for my part i am delighted to see this provision in the bill and i hope the minister will keep it there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to protest against the suggestion made by the noble lord who has just resumed his seat that because expenditure falls on the national insurance fund rather than apart from per cent <e> <s> of it directly on the exchequer it is not for practical purposes public expenditure <e> <s> with great respect that is a fallacious argument and expenditure from the national insurance fund has always been treated as a matter of financial policy under all governments as public expenditure particularly from the point of view of its economic effects <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am most grateful to her <e> <s> i am sure that she does not want to misrepresent me <e> <s> the point of the noble lord lord banks that i took up was his suggestion that expenditure from the national insurance fund was not public expenditure and did not have the economic significance of public expenditure no more and no less <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not for a moment quarrel with the strong feelings expressed by the noble lord lord wells-pestell about unemployment <e> <s> indeed <e> <s> i share them and i agree with him very much that the worst aspect of it is the sense of futility and frustration of the man or the woman who wakes up in the morning and finds there is no job to do who has to hang about feeling unwanted <e>

wants me to tell the house and the government what i think can he done to deal with the economic situation i shall he out of order <e>", "<cs> with great respect to my noble friend i sought to

offensive if i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether it follows that the damage done by this extraordinary action was very much minimised by the refusal of the sensible british public to respond to it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord mccarthy will take the excellent advice which has just been given to him by his noble friend lord houghton of sowerby speaking with the advantage of immense experience and not press this amendment <e> <s> the clause may or may not be in perfect form <e> <s> we have had a good deal of argument which it would be a waste of time to recapitulate on precise aspects of it <e> <s> at committee stage apparently the noble lord lord mccarthy was sufficiently satisfied with the answers he got not to press his amendments and i hope he will follow that good habit here <e> <s> because there is really one simple justification for this clause and that is the continuance of a closed shop situation <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that even in a non-closed shop situation expulsion from a union with the personal and social problems that that can create is a very serious matter and i agree with him that it can raise matters of public as well as private importance <e> <s> but i concentrate on the closed shop situation because where you have a closed shop and if they are to continue expulsion from a union can and generally does mean the loss of your job and refusal of election to a union can mean the impossibility of obtaining a job you want <e> <s> that is a matter of major importance and when an individual is so placed i must confess it offends my sense of justice that anyone should seek to deny him access to an independent tribunal to argue his case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> in suggesting that my constituent should have gone to the high court would he just tell me how long that would have taken and what would have happened to him

perhaps should offer no increases at all <e>", "<cs> my <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us feel gratitude for this first manifestation of the success of the governments policy but that our gratitude is subject to the classical definition of that word a lively anticipation of favours to come <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word or two in support of what the noble lord lord byers said about the treatment of junior ministers in this house <e> <s> as he said they have been very badly treated indeed for some years and their position is really quite urgent <e> <s> all of us whatever our political views and wherever in the house we sit acknowledge that the junior ministers and particularly the lords-in-waiting do a remarkable and strenuous job <e> <s> when my noble friend replies i hope that he will give some indication that the government really do attach some urgency to dealing with this matter quickly and will give some indication as to when the proposals are likely to be brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> i moved back from the microphone because i had the impression that i might be blasting the house <e> <s> as the noble lord was kind enough to say i have quite a powerful voice so that if it was unduly amplified it might be extraordinarily disagreeable to noble lords <e> <s> but i hope that if in response to the noble lord i switch up the power he will equally indicate to me if i have overdone my response to his request <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the advantages which this house has in dealing with civil aviation matters is that the reply comes from a minister who not only speaks as he pointed out on behalf of his department but also with very great practical experience of civil aviation in which before his promotion to his present post he played a very prominent part <e> <s> indeed those of us who have just listened to his speech realise that it was a great deal more than just the kind of speech to which my noble friend lord bessborough referred in a quotation from a work which of course i am inhibited from referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that one of the lessons learned is the lesson not to pay too much attention to the opposition in another place when they object to the starting of say the local government bill in this house <e> <s> will her majestys government remember on a future occasion that their giving way to the opposition on that in another place merely resulted in the noble baroness here today twitting them with their failure to introduce any major bill first in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he can assure the house that the manpower services commission regards it as part of its duty to invite the attention of unemployed people particularly young unemployed people to the considerable number of vacancies for most excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords i will begin too if i may by expressing very sincere congratulations to my noble friend lord marshall of leeds on an exceedingly interesting and penetrating maiden speech <e> <s> leeds seems almost to be taking over this house what with my noble friend lord marshall and my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> i was almost reflecting this afternoon that if the department of the environment proves wholly incapable of repairing our chamber it may well be that we shall be hi-jacked off to the leeds city hall <e> <s> my lords my noble friend will be a very great asset to the house and it was a great pleasure to me particularly as at least by birth a fellow-yorkshireman to hear him have so great a success <e>", "<cs> of course with the greatest of pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts it that way but of course it was a criticism <e> <s> his criticism was that unemployment would rise i do not think he quoted that in his speech but he quotes it now to a figure of million <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will just think this out <e> <s> it is not proven i hope and pray it may not be the case that unemployment in any event will rise to that figure although i think it will go over the million mark <e> <s> but suppose the government were to alter course for that reason <e> <s> has my noble friend thought out where that would end <e> <s> if the government abandon their battle against inflation if inflation resumes in full fury and moves into hyper-inflation what is unemployment going to do then <e> <s> my noble friends proposals and i will come to them if he wishes in a moment would undoubtedly check it for a little for a period of a few months perhaps but if we are to go into hyper-inflation as a result of abandonment of the only policies so far put forward and pursued to deal with inflation what would that hyperinflation itself do to the levels of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords yes he was <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether it amounts to any more than saying to the office of manpower economics please do not do it again <e> <s> is he aware that in local government the district auditor would hold personally responsible officials who committed errors costing even a small fraction of the amount involved by the error in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always been a great admirer of the noble lord lord wells-pestell and it is therefore agreeable to be able to begin by saying how wholeheartedly i agree with one of the things which he said in his speech <e> <s> that was when he said that those who had had the good fortune to serve in the department of health and social security or its predecessors had inevitably a very high regard for the calibre and quality of the staff of that department <e> <s> i should like very strongly to endorse that <e> <s> i have always held the private view that with the possible exception of the treasury the staff of the social security departments are of the highest level of ability in the whole of whitehall <e> <s> with that quality i hope that they will be able as the noble lord lord wells-pestell suggested to produce a clear understandable handbook about these highly complex regulations <e> <s> i have always regarded it as the mark of the real expert to be able to set out complex facts in clear and simple english <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will set her departmental staffs that task because it is important that those involved should have a reasonable chance of understanding what their rights are <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me is the house to understand that it will be only negative procedure orders which will be laid in the group referred to by his noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he accepts that to maintain expenditure in real terms cannot be described as a cut <e> <s> at a time when departments of great importance such as those dealing with education and housing are being subjected to real cuts why is this particular organisation exempted from them <e> <s> is that not carrying my noble friends chivalry a little too far <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend arguing that his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer would accept from other departments that there were cuts where the cuts were only in planned expenditure <e> <s> if that doctrine is accepted is it not an incitement deliberately to plan for substantial increases in expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether the government appreciate that the introduction of anything on these lines through community legislation into the company law of this country would have drastic and difficult consequences including <e>", "<cs> my lords a major civil aviation bill comes before parliament generally only about once in a decade <e> <s> when it does it is a matter of very great public importance for it involves the regulation and control of a major and a highly successful british industry <e> <s> it is not always fully appreciated that we in this country have the second largest civil aviation industry in the free world <e> <s> i have to use that qualification the free world since the cloud of military security hangs over the civil aviation activities as it often hangs over the accident records of the communist world <e> <s> but after the united states though a long way after of course british civil aviation is the second in the free world <e> <s> it is a major industry <e> <s> in connection and in partnership with our tourist industry the two are the biggest earners of foreign exchange <e> <s> it is also an industry in which we are highly efficient <e> <s> indeed it is an industry that includes the only british nationalised industry which is at the same time fully exposed to world competition and makes a profit <e>", "<cs> i know what my noble friend has in mind <e> <s> he has in mind the industry over which he presided with such great distinction but he will also recall the limitations of the competition to which it was exposed with its built-in purchaser in the shape of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do recall those provisions <e> <s> i do not of course know how the secretary of state acted or what information he had <e> <s> it was certainly indicated in hong kong that strong representations were being made to her majestys government and i cannot believe that the secretary of state was wholly unaware of those <e> <s> but i am obliged to my noble friend for touching on a point i was going to make <e> <s> were a secretary of state in considering an appeal to take into account anything other than what was on the shorthand note of evidence it would mean that he was hearing views sound or unsound which had not been given as the evidence at the hearing had before the other parties and was liable to be cross-examined but which had come to him direct <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to say so at this early stage i agree with very much of what he has said <e> <s> indeed i can claim the credential that i was a member of the british cabinet which in the early s over-ruled the determination of british airways to cancel their order for the vc and made them take the vc and therefore was entitled to great credit not only for the good that did the british aircraft industry but for the good that did british airways to have what was then the most comfortable aeroplane in the world <e>", "<cs> i fear so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before leaving the point can my noble friend tell the house what was so exceptional about this case <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has said and i have read the statement of my right honourable friend and his right honourable friend that what was exceptional was the difference in the traffic forecasts <e> <s> surely there has hardly ever been a licensing case before the authority where there has not been a dispute over traffic forecasts <e> <s> that is what all these cases are about <e> <s> what his right honourable friend did not explain was what in this case in relation to the traffic forecasts was so unusual that it could not be said to arise in any other case whatever <e> <s> the problem is that his right honourable friend was putting his judgment which in the nature of things is less instructed against that of the professional authority who are weighing traffic forecasts every day of their working life <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend whom i thank for that reply recall that in his report sir alan marre says that a main cause of the loss of this million was inexcusable confusion within the office on the question of checking <e> <s> if that finding is accurate is it not at least possible that the senior officer responsible for the administrative arrangements of the office carries a degree of personal responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this office has been operating for nine years and that an administrative set-up in which there can be confusion on this quite elementary point surely reflects remarkably little credit on those responsible for its organisation <e>", "<cs> if i had had any doubt in my mind that i should be opposed to this amendment it would have been removed by some of the concluding observations of the noble baroness lady denington <e> <s> she said that to a private builder continuity of work did not matter he could just dispose of his men whereas a direct labour organisation was in a different position <e> <s> in the first place i think that that is a very unjust approach to the private builder <e> <s> to suggest that private builders should quite lightheartedly have to dispose of a large number of their men because the work was going to a direct labour organisation i think is very unfair to them and all the more unfair when it is remembered that the organisation to which their work apparently is to be diverted is an organisation maintained by the very body which they have to finance through the payment of rates <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord be good enough to answer the point which i put and which he did not answer whether it is a proper and essential function of local government to use revenue raised from the ratepayers including among those ratepayers people in the building industry in order to maintain an activity which is not a basic part of local government in competition with some of its own ratepayers <e>", "<cs> i am deeply touched and flattered by the noble lords concern with my particular views on the intricacies of scottish housing but might it not be more economical of the time of the committee if he were to address his inquiries to her majestys governments ministers who are responsible <e>", "<cs> i do not always feel subject to an irresistible urge to support the noble lord lord mishcon but on this occasion it seems to me that he is on to a reasonable point <e> <s> i recall as he does the occasion when he moved a prayer to annul a negative resolution and was i think very properly advised that though it would be legally open to this house so to proceed it was contrary to long-established practice <e>", "<cs> my lords would not any competently and commercially-minded business seek to spread the load in the way suggested by the noble baroness and also maximise earnings in this way <e> <s> as it is the taxpayer who has to make up the deficits on the postal side of the post office has not parliament some right to urge this rather strongly on the management of that corporation <e>", "<cs> it is undoubtedly the case as was said by the noble lord lord greenwood of rossen-dale who speaks in this house with the great experience of a former minister in charge of the department that the powers under the whole of this part of the bill are drastic <e> <s> but i am bound to say and i hope that i shall cause no offence to any other noble lord or noble lady that for that reason i welcome them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that very helpful reply may i ask him what is the mechanism for securing that these bodies are aware of the governments view of what would be the acceptable level of awards <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that historically the wages councils were introduced in industries where wages were felt to be reasonably low do i take it that my noble friends indication of a government review includes reconsideration of their position in industries in which that situation no longer continues <e>", "<cs> more than enough <e>", "<cs> i too share the regret of the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale that apparently the very helpful suggestion of the noble lord lord mishcon does not appear to have been accepted by the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord greenwood is absolutely right in that the clause itself introduces a new principle about which people on both sides of the committee i think have very real doubts <e> <s> it would seem to me to have been much better to explore the whole issue as to whether there should be charges before proceeding in detail to consider whether any particular body should be excepted or included or varied within it <e> <s> indeed if we do not do that it may well put some of us in a difficulty <e>", "<cs> as chairman of a company that manufactures a necessary material for the building industry i think that i should declare an interest at this stage <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that the proposal to charge for planning permissions imposes an additional charge on building and construction and therefore there is certainly a marginal significance in all this as regards my company <e> <s> therefore in accordance with our normal custom i declare that interest <e> <s> but equally having so declared that interest as i understand our procedure i am free to express my own views <e> <s> i feel considerable apprehension about this <e>", "<cs> right in the middle <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend confirm my reading of the clause <e> <s> although he has given the committee the figures of charges now contemplated should the clause become law the secretary of state could by regulation increase it almost indefinitely <e>", "<cs> following the point which i myself was about to make but which was made much better by the noble lord lord ross of marnock about the ministers comment on the regulations may i ask him this if he wishes seriously to rest on that point will he give an assurance now that when the regulations are brought forward if they are ever brought forward under these proposals they will exclude these small properties as suggested in this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord has said this is the last opportunity perhaps it will be the report stage for your lordships to assert yourselves on this matter because we cannot amend regulations <e> <s> if i may take that point one degree further we are entitled to reject an affirmative resolution and this house has done it but in a matter of this sort which in a way is a measure for raising taxation it might well be argued and i myself would have some hesitations as to whether this house was really morally justified in resisting the regulation <e> <s> so we come back to this <e> <s> if the minister is to have this power can he give an assurance as to how it is going to be exercised <e>", "<cs> a good many hours ago i made a speech in which i sought to suggest to your lordships certain aspects of principle <e> <s> i promise your lordships that i shall not indulge in tedious repetition by repeating it <e> <s> but if i may i should like to comment on one or two points that have been made in the course of this extremely interesting debate <e>", "<cs> not if it is refused <e>", "<cs> and if it is refused your cheque is returned <e>", "<cs> if my noble friends authority does not return those cheques i suggest that it very urgently consults its legal advisers <e> <s> no analogy helps us as i am sure he would agree <e> <s> it is a change of a quite important nature <e> <s> in his reply on the earlier amendment my noble friend and this is the only reason i return to it did not answer the question he answered so many that i fully sympathise with him as to how much of the million that he sought to raise would be offset by administrative expenses <e>", "<cs> on the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he say whether her majestys government are not deeply disappointed at this delay <e> <s> also is he able to give any indication as to when in particular the restriction on air navigation is going to be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also say that it seems a very sensible decision to do this despite the dislocation that it no doubt will cause in administrative arrangements and that it indicates the proper seriousness with which the government are treating the scrutiny activities of this house on government legislation <e> <s> for that reason i welcome it a great deal <e>", "<cs> as we are having a general debate on the first few clauses of the bill i wonder whether my noble friend could take this opportunity to clear up a point which was not wholly clear to me in his statement the other day <e> <s> he was perfectly clear that for very obvious reasons the flotation of the shares would have to be deferred but i was less clear as to whether the governments intention in the light of that is that the transformation of the present airways corporation into a companies act company is also going to be deferred <e> <s> i am wondering whether he can give any indication as to when that transition is likely to take place <e> <s> it would be helpful to know and i should be most grateful if my noble friend could clear up that point <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend a question as to the operation of these borrowing powers as it is proposed by his amendment to extend them <e> <s> it is my recollection that in the past when british airways or boac and bea before that wished to purchase particular aircraft well within the capital limits laid down in respect of their borrowing powers they none the less had to get the agreement of the department of trade to the particular purchases which they contemplated <e> <s> does that somewhat restrictive inhibition still continue <e>", "<cs> and of course once the british airways board has become a company then presumably detailed control over its investment will go <e>", "<cs> as i understand the noble lord lord beswick this amendment is basically more of a probing character than one intended as a major amendment to the bill <e> <s> the noble lord in his speech was good enough to refer to the fact that at second reading i had indicated a degree of puzzlement as to what my noble friend had meant as to the intentions of the government over the appointment of the new board <e> <s> as i understand it there are three phases we are concerned with the phase during which the present set-up of a state corporation continues the stage at which it is transformed into a companies act company but the government retaining all the shares and the final phase in which the government retains some shares perhaps a majority but there is a substantial private shareholding <e> <s> obviously all those three situations are different and i think it would be very helpful to the committee and indeed to people outside if my noble friend could share with us a little the governments ideas on how they propose to man the board during those three phases <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not accept this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me almost a paradoxical argument to that advanced by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that by insisting on retaining a per cent <e> <s> share at least the government would be showing confidence in british airways <e> <s> it seems to me that the argument falls the other way that it would show a lack of confidence in the management of the new company if the government wished to insist for all time and in all circumstances on retaining control <e>", "<cs> would <e>", "<cs> as there is no occupant at present of the bishops bench i can i think with impunity refer to this amendment as being something of a curates egg good in parts <e> <s> with the first part that which suggests that action should be taken to forward employee shareholding in the new british airways set-up i am wholly in agreement <e> <s> the noble lord was good enough to point out that as chairman of a company which has i think one of the best employee shareholding schemes in the country i have some direct experience of its operation <e> <s> while i wholly agree with him that such a system is not a specific against all the ills which can afflict any company it contributes very strongly to the feeling of comradeship of all being on the same side which is so valuable inside an industrial organisation today <e> <s> therefore i yield to no-one not even to the occupants of the liberal benches in my enthusiasm for employee shareholding <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me if the word <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord look at his own amendment <e> <s> there is nothing in it to say work in or be part of a company <e> <s> the designation is that he is a trustee of the employee-held shares who may be anybody whom they may have appointed and a perfectly suitable person for that purpose <e> <s> regarding where a large block of shares is bought and discussion about the appointment of a director that is done on its merits <e> <s> the difference is that it is proposed to make this statutory and <e>", "<cs> if the committee were to adopt it my noble friends amendment would remove a very substantial part of the bill which <e>", "<cs> a cabotage route as i understand it is a route between this country and a territory which this country controls <e> <s> it is therefore a route where it is for the aviation authorities of this country to license and lay down who may operate it <e> <s> the classic example of a cabotage route about which i hope to have a certain amount to say on a later amendment is the route between london and hong kong <e>", "<cs> i have heard my noble friend speak on many occasions and i hope he will not mind my saying that rarely have i heard him being less persuasive than he has just been <e> <s> to say as he did that one cannot put a duty on the authority to stimulate competition on international routes because foreign governments would only permit one airline to operate is a dangerous half-truth <e> <s> i invite my noble friends attention to the provisions of the bermuda ii agreement which was made only last year and under which at least two british as well as two american airlines are able to operate on a number of north atlantic routes <e>", "<cs> of course it was not because under the act that is the prerogative of the government but and here my noble friend really has missed the point bermuda ii having been negotiated and being the framework it is then the duty of the civil aviation authority to licence the airlines who apply to operate on it <e> <s> that is precisely the point <e> <s> therefore my noble friend is really not right when he tries to lay down the universal proposition that foreign governments and the negotiations with them which the british government undertake forbid in all cases the putting of a second british operator on the route because bermuda ii does the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend because now we have succeeded in establishing that there are some international routes on which it is perfectly possible to license more than one british carrier <e> <s> the question is what should be the authoritys duty in that respect <e> <s> as the bill now stands the authority may well read it that none the less it shall license only one british operator on that route whereas it is free under the arrangements made with a foreign government to license two operators <e> <s> if my amendment or something like it is accepted it will clearly be the duty of the civil aviation authority to license two or as many british operators as wish to apply and are acceptable to the foreign government <e>", "<cs> i know the civil aviation authority well enough to know that it could not be tamed either by the noble lord or by my noble friend lord trefgarne <e> <s> on the contrary what i am seeking to do is to give it a guidance guidance itself being technically abolished by an earlier section that what parliament wishes to see is the promotion of competition and i have little doubt that it would welcome that with open arms <e> <s> i will give way to the noble lord in a moment but i do not want to get my noble friend lord trefgarne out of my sights for too long <e> <s> my noble friend referred to section <e>", "<cs> it had the direct effect of promoting dual designation as my noble friend knows perfectly well <e> <s> it provided dual designation on new york he cannot dispute that and san francisco those are examples that leap immediately to mind <e> <s> it is perfectly plain that the purpose of this was to promote competition between british airlines on foreign routes <e> <s> let me put this to my noble friend <e> <s> if he thinks my amendment is wrong and section <e>", "<cs> on the contrary british airways did not regard section <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will perhaps preserve his soul in patience until we come to the amendment on which the hong kong route arises <e> <s> he may find that the criticism i make of it is not of the substance of that but on the contrary as to the particular method which his right honourable friend the secretary of state saw fit to adopt and all the repercussions which will follow from that <e> <s> but we shall both be wasting the time of the committee if we anticipate that amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will look at the provisions of the bill he will see that it is not giving the authority that kind of freedom of discretion <e> <s> if it left the matter absolutely to their discretion i have the greatest confidence in them and i would be perfectly happy <e> <s> but the trouble is as the noble lord will see if he looks at the section that it lays down with a certain measure of precision the new section a for example it shall be the duty of the authority to do this and that <e> <s> having reached that point the government are seeing fit to lay down these rules <e> <s> whether the government should do so is another question on which i take the noble lords point but having done so it is <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord thinks that then i can only say that in his reading of the statutes he and i must agree in the most friendly way to differ <e> <s> in my view it is less conducive to the stimulation of competition on international routes and i am not talking about cabotage or domestic than is the current act of <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord trefgarne challenges that <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will permit me i referred to that in my speech some little time ago <e> <s> i pointed out and he has not dealt with the point that that which was of course the amendment put in on report in another place tells the authority only <e>", "<cs> i cannot pretend to be satisfied with my noble friends reply and i say to him with great respect that when he reads it himself tomorrow morning he may share a measure of that dissatisfaction <e> <s> but if the government are obdurate on this and if the government wish to go back to some extent on their past attitude to the promotion of competition on these routes i do not think it is any use my continuing to press the amendment <e> <s> for even if the committee were as it might to decide to support my amendment i suppose that the government would go back to another place and waste everybodys time by having it taken out of the bill <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment was intended to make abundantly clear the importance of the position of the consumer <e> <s> if my noble friends speech means as i think it does that in the governments view that is already fully and adequately provided for then i would certainly not wish to waste the time of the committee in pressing him further <e> <s> therefore unless any other noble lord or baroness wishes to speak i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on the second part of the amendment concerning the time limit i think that my noble friend has given a perfectly adequate answer <e> <s> i put down that arbitrarily short period with the intention of probing this and eliciting some statement <e> <s> on the other hand my noble friend knows that sometimes when appeals have been made to secretaries of state they have taken a very long time indeed to give their decisions and such delay causes the greatest inconvenience and indeed loss to the airlines themselves <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i think that that goes a good way <e> <s> the indication is that the secretary of state hopes to do better in the future and i hope that he will <e>", "<cs> it is a curious argument that because that is how he always acts he cannot accept the restriction <e> <s> it might have been an argument put the other way <e> <s> i hope that this amendment has served to show the concern to which a further decision by the secretary of state to allow an appeal would give rise <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick indicated that he wanted to ride a division on my amendment <e> <s> i suppose he can therefore suggest that the committee refuse permission to me to withdraw it <e> <s> of course he cannot compel me to vote for it in those circumstances <e> <s> i should have thought that from his own point of view and his own high standing in this house he would do well not to object to an application to withdraw by me but would move his own amendment and let it stand on its own merits <e> <s> i am sure he would be the last man to say that my draftmanship is better than his <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances without further ado i ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is that it is not the next amendment <e> <s> the next amendment is my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> while considering that suggestion may i ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first in using the argument that it would be wrong to put the caa in the position of controlling these limitations has he in mind that they provide the air traffic controller at all the baa airports and therefore are in fact as it were the executive arm in deciding whether or not aircraft should take off <e> <s> surely it would be convenient that they should also have the power and particularly the discretion to waive limitations in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> i should have found my noble friends response a little more convincing if with his habitual chivalry he had not attempted to defend the decision in the specific case in july of last year when the three british airways s were involved <e> <s> it is impossible to study that case without coming to the clear conclusion that those responsible i think in this instance the british airports authority were guilty of a rather brutal error of judgment <e> <s> regardless of whether british airways were or were not at fault in the previous arrangements that they had made to have people who could have been well on their way by aircraft either sleeping on the floor of the lounge or accommodated in hotels some of them a long way away was really an extraordinary error of judgment <e> <s> had my noble friend been able to acknowledge that one would have had a little more confidence in the direct handling by the british airports authority or the ultimate responsibility of his secretary of state <e> <s> having had some experience of these matters i should have thought that when an error of this kind has been made it is not only pleasant but also expedient to acknowledge it <e>", "<cs> well i am always ready to be convinced by my noble friend who is persuasiveness itself <e> <s> i should be very grateful if he would write to me perhaps before the report stage otherwise i might consider taking this matter further <e> <s> perhaps he will undertake to do that and i shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i follow up that point <e> <s> if there should be the kind of minor matters to which my noble friend has referred there is of course a procedure which he could follow which would avoid any difficulty even if this amendment were inserted in the bill <e> <s> it is that the secretary of state instead of allowing an appeal which is a rather ponderous thing to do could simply refer the matter back to the authority with a request that they consider that aspect of it <e> <s> there is little doubt that in those circumstances the authority would revise their decision in the light of that request <e> <s> that gets out of all the difficulties in regard both to laying the report before parliament and the undermining of the caas authority by allowing an appeal <e> <s> it is a procedure that has in fact been followed on occasions <e>", "<cs> does not that answer confirm what was said on early amendments as to the undesirability save in the rarest cases of the secretary of state exercising these powers of appeal and does it not perhaps suggest that his powers so to do should be very restricted <e> <s> we have as the noble lord lord beswick has said a situation in which there has been a full hearing in public witnesses cross-examined giving their evidence in public and all the procedures of a quasi-judicial hearing <e> <s> if the conclusion is to be upset as a result of a decision made in private by a minister of the crown without directly hearing any witnesses it does seem as the noble lord has said that it is a very unfortunate and rather indecorous conclusion to the proceedings <e> <s> i would not mind if the power went altogether but if it is to remain i would suggest it should be very much restricted <e>", "<cs> and a jolly good one <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord george-brown is indebted to my noble friend for that answer but it is not the complete answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord george-brown suggested that it be circulated in <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go much further into this except to say that it was my noble friend himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that extremely interesting reply can he carry it a little further and indicate when the substantial reforms which were advocated in this house in the recent debate on the pru system are likely to be put into operation and whether he is aware of the urgency of this in view of the excessive settlements which it has produced in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware i am sure he is that it is the percentage rise in a particular year in civil service pay which tends to be the trend-setter throughout the public sector and to some extent in the private sector and is he therefore aware of the very heavy responsibility which lies on him to secure that whatever system is used in place of the old pru settlements produced are moderate in percentage terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that somewhat austere reply <e> <s> i should like to ask whether he is not aware of the fact that we have already reached a situation in which an elector in buckingham for example has only one-quarter or one-fifth of the voting power of an elector in some of the city centres <e> <s> that surely brings discredit upon representative democracy and will not my noble friend confirm that the government are at least on speaking terms with the boundary commissions and could pass on this novel idea to them <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships are aware of the fact that from to i was the first chairman of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> i mention that now only in case any of your lordships should think that in what i say this afternoon i am affected by unconscious bias arising from that experience <e> <s> i try to address myself to this objectively but none of us can be a hundred per cent <e> <s> sure that we succeed in such a task <e> <s> i thought it right to mention that fact so that if your lordships feel that what i say this afternoon should not be taken as seriously as it otherwise might be because of a possible bias then your lordships are free to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to speak by way of intervention in his speech <e> <s> i do not think i need the leave of the house <e> <s> may i tell him that during my own tenure of office as chairman and i do not think there has been any change in cases of substance we generally sat three to a tribunal perhaps on occasion two <e> <s> there is under the regulations power for one member of the authority to exercise the jurisdiction <e> <s> it is very convenient when some minor correction of a licence arises a technical point to do it <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear that acceptance of my noble friends amendments would involve some saving in the home office staff <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend on the front bench is going to accept the amendments but in any event it would be helpful if he could quantify this <e> <s> incidentally it would appear that technical and professional staff are involved <e> <s> as it is the declared policy of the government wherever possible to reduce governmental staffs surely this is a point which should commend itself to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> perhaps also he would satisfy at least my curiosity by telling me when is the next occasion that the so-called working party is going to stir in its sleep <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word on amendment no <e> <s> and before i do so to express a regret that the enthusiastic speech of the noble lord lord avebury in favour of pedal cycling was not listened to by the noble and learned lord who normally occupies the woolsack and who is perhaps the most eminent of all our pedal cyclists with the possible exception of the noble lord lord avebury himself <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that when the post-war government nationalised these industries they did so on the grounds that they alleged that they were failing the nation <e> <s> do not the figures which my noble friend has just given to the house suggest that applying that logic they had better be very speedily de-nationalised <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully support my noble friend lord renton in this part of his tireless crusade for the better drafting of legislation <e> <s> i yield to no one in my admiration for him over that <e> <s> but certainly i could not support this amendment as it stands as although he indicated that he did not care one way or the other whether its effect would be to restrict the powers of the secretary of state to cases in which the return on capital was below the prescribed rate i am bound to confess that i do <e> <s> i should be very disappointed if at this stage we sought to limit the secretary of state solely to acting on that consideration <e> <s> there may well be other cases in which it would be right for the secretary of state so to act <e> <s> one obviously would be if a direct labour organisation was <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house negatives the amendment i think noble lords will want to note the quite extraordinary argument used a moment or two ago by the noble baroness <e> <s> she said that at present dlos were doing jobs which required legalisation <e> <s> if that is true it seems to me the worst possible argument for extending their powers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how much i welcome the indication my noble and learned friend has given that the government are reviewing the rating system because the rating system is <e> <s> i think rightly extraordinarily unpopular very unjust in its incidence and if a better system can be evolved as personally i believe it can be this will be a very great improvement indeed <e> <s> may i add one further thing <e> <s> if another system is evolved i hope it will take into account the impact of the rating system on industry and business <e>

party conference would my noble friend institute the necessary proceedings under the mental health act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to think that i am apparently the answer to the prayer of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> some time ago if he will not mind my reminding the house he began by indicating that it was his prayer that no one should vote for the government on this amendment

"<cs> my lords i fully understand that <e> <s> i am capable of understanding the words of the section <e> <s> they are as the noble baroness says perfectly clear <e> <s> but what i think she has failed to apprehend is that if the facts are not such as to enable the secretary of state so to satisfy himself he would be liable to be stopped in the courts presumably by the procedure of injunction and prevented from proceeding <e> <s> the words which are sought to be taken out of the clause compel him where the facts are such that the orderly development of the new town may be hampered to be deprived of the power and if he sought to exercise it he would be restrained by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord ridley knows i have differed from him and from my noble friend lord bellwin throughout on this question of introducing charges for planning applications <e> <s> i still think that they are wrong in principle and harmful in practice <e> <s> but your lordships have decided otherwise and we must as my noble friend lord ridley has said therefore accept them <e> <s> i wholly join with him on that basis in being very critical of the governments attempt to exempt themselves and the nationalised industries from this imposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

something like that looks like it may have many merits but simplicity is not among its more conspicuous ones <e> <s> indeed if one takes the two most complex aspects of government social security on the one hand and taxation on the other and mixes them up together i can assure the noble lord that though the result may be palatable it is not very easily comprehensible save by people who have

this is a simple solution <e> <s> it may be a solution but simplicity i beg him to believe he will not find <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving the figure of million did my noble friend make any offsetting

recital of the woes of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would wait just a moment i would be only too happy to give way but it might save the time of the house if i just put the point fully so that he could then deal with it as i am sure he will <e> <s> the point i wish to put to him is this <e> <s> that acceptable figure was per cent <e> <s> that was precisely what mr

fact to repay to the consumer the money unnecessarily exacted from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while

incentives in my submission to the house it would be a retrograde step to increase the quite substantial burden of income tax now carried by such relatively high earners and in contempory terms they

paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and in particular for contradicting the statement in <e>", "<cs> my lords under the new arrangement how will the appointment of the

necessity for change that it is worth while imposing this additional burden on the management of companies <e>", "<cs> would my noble and learned friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think that he

the ministers in the department concerned and not the responsibility of the house authorities who are responsible for printing <e> <s> secondly i hope that he will confirm that in the light of the experiences particularly as regards measures from the department of trade something is being done in that department to ensure that this does not happen again at least on this scale <e>", "<cs> it

steadily every year out of the product of lowering rates of taxation because the general growth in the economy meant that lower rates of taxation produced a higher yield <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene as the noble lord put a question to me obviously if what is involved is not a cut but what i may call an anti-cut then my question does not apply <e> <s> my question applies only to what is the really difficult issue to which i hope the noble lord will address himself as to where savings can be made although painfully and what to do about it if you do not make the savings <e>", "<cs> my

second reading turned <e>", "<cs> is there not such a thing as the universal church <e>", "<cs> may i take up a point because if it was in order for the noble duke i am sure it is in order for me which was made by the noble duke in his reference to our committee stage debate with respect to the attitude of church leaders <e> <s> i would say at once that i should be extremely unhappy if any misunderstanding on my part of what the noble duke the duke of norfolk reported as being the attitude of his eminence cardinal hume a man for whom i have very great admiration caused any misunderstanding at all <e> <s> i should very much regret that <e> <s> the episode as the noble duke will remember was one in which we were fellow-workers in the same <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful having listened to my noble and learned friend if he could clarify a little at least to my mind what the reason is for the prescription of this two-year figure at all <e> <s> i take note that he has said that it is not always to be insisted upon <e> <s> however what exactly is the point <e> <s> what is the justification for it <e> <s> is it not just one of these further barriers which the clause puts up and which on an earlier amendment a good many of us thought amounted to a good deal of discouragement to people going abroad at all <e>", "<cs> does that mean that a young married man whose wife is well on in pregnancy simply cannot accept an overseas appointment <e>", "<cs> surely the noble and learned lord will agree that what he is trying to deal with is indiscretion <e> <s> is it not bordering on the verge of the fantastic to suggest that a couple the wife being pregnant will hastily apply for a job overseas in order to get british citizenship for the unborn child <e> <s> on how many occasions in the real world will this happen <e> <s> on the other hand by keeping this two-year provision in the clause and i do not want to be a bore about this because i spoke at some length on it earlier he will add to the general apprehensions of those who the government want to have to rely on clause for the citizenship of their child when they go to work abroad for this country <e> <s> surely the sensible thing for the government to do is to drop this silly provision <e> <s> if they do not i hope that my noble friend will press his amendment <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord renton was undoubtedly referring to an earlier observation of mine but was tactful enough not to <e>", "<cs> when considering this matter would my noble and learned friend examine in particular subsection <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make my point too clearly <e> <s> where days is laid down in the statute unless there is some explicit indication that the statutory days limit might be waived might it not be held that there was no discretion because the statute had very clearly laid down a days limit <e>", "<cs> i believe my noble friend realises what a very serious criticism he has just made of the bill and of the structure of the bill <e> <s> the self-employed overseas perform very important functions indeed <e> <s> at this hour i will not reiterate them because they have already been mentioned several times today <e> <s> the self-employed overseas perform major services for this country in connection with overseas developments professional services and the rest <e> <s> for the minister to come forward at this stage having taken the bill through one house and say that because of the general scheme of the bill it is not possible to make any provision for these people at all is really one of the most serious criticisms of the bill that i have heard during our debates <e> <s> i should like to have from my noble friend the minister a clear indication of his determination to do something for these people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend appreciate that the anxiety that has been expressed in a number of questions in this house will certainly not be dissipated by those figures <e> <s> are these not somewhat elderly aircraft <e> <s> and despite the admirable maintenance of the queens flight in view of the fact that there have been one or two somewhat disconcerting accidents to aircraft of this type and age are not ministers perhaps taking a very serious responsibility in not going forward with a replacement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> after the state occasions the dust-carts <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that very satisfactory reply can i infer from it that if he were to have his attention drawn to specific examples her majestys government would take the necessary action <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend lord belstead will not think it offensive if i say that in his speech he did not really even attempt to justify the retention in the bill of the expression full-time which my noble friends amendment seeks to delete <e> <s> he said that where employment was to be the link with the united kingdom it should be significant and i certainly would not want to argue with him about that <e> <s> i would agree with him about that <e> <s> but employment can be significant particularly in the cases of certain individuals without being full-time <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend indicates what he is going to do i should like to take up one personal reference made by my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> i welcome his emphasis on consistency and i hope that he will apply it himself <e> <s> his argument on this occasion was against leaving matters to the discretion of the secretary of state <e> <s> when we come to subsequent amendments he will no doubt find that quoted against him <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate referred again to an issue which arose the other day on the -day provision <e> <s> i should like to be a little clearer in my mind than i am as to what it is he has just said to us <e> <s> has he been telling the committee that even if this clause goes through as it stands there will be a statutory -day period of limitation <e> <s> and notwithstanding the fact that there does not appear to be any express power given to the secretary of state to modify that -day rule is there nonetheless somewhere to be found in the sub-section or in the bill a power in the secretary of state to override the -day statutory figure <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would clarify that <e>", "<cs> what would happen if the days came in the middle of a period and not conveniently at the beginning <e>", "<cs> yes add to it <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend lady elles why she has inserted in the amendment the word permanently <e> <s> is she not putting up a considerable obstacle in the way of the applicant <e> <s> the fact that the parents are living apart is easily demonstrable but who is to know after they have been living apart for some time that they may not come together <e> <s> therefore to include the word permanently must put a heavy onus on the applicant <e> <s> i wonder whether the amendment would not be much better without it <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble and learned lord will give a little more thought to this <e> <s> we are getting case after case in which the noble and learned lord or the noble lord beside him says oh yes this is a hard case it is an obvious case and therefore i think is probably one for discretion <e> <s> that is said in good faith but as has been pointed out it is an assurance which has no legal value whatsoever <e> <s> it cannot be quoted in any court and it is not binding in any sense <e> <s> as we are continually being reminded we are dealing with a clause which gives an entitlement <e> <s> if an amendment is put in there is the entitlement and there is something to argue about if a future secretary of state refuses a request <e> <s> but in the light of what has happened the alternative so agreeably offered from the front bench really amounts to very little at all and if we are not to have in some quotable form an assurance that these cases will be covered it may well be a temptation to some noble lords to press the matter to a division to try to put the provision into the bill so that there would be something which gives an entitlement <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm and this arises out of what the noble lord lord beswick said that the air traffic controllers are not in dispute with their own employers the civil aviation authority but have been called out by the union as part of their quarrel with the government <e>", "<cs> for my part i think that what my noble friend the minister has suggested by way of procedure is right we should first deal with and settle this amendment and then proceed to the amendment of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> i rise only to ask my noble friend a question and his answer may well be of help on quite a number of subsequent amendments in which the five-year limitation reappears <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend add to his reply to me by saying that before the report stage he is prepared to consider introducing in respect of subsection a discretionary relaxation parallel to that which as he has pointed out already exists in respect of subsection <e> <s> i am not asking him to commit himself but surely there is a certain logic in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead is taking a rather roundabout course to his objective <e> <s> on an earlier amendment i founded my argument for a little flexibility over the five-year limit on the basis that there was already in the bill some flexibility over the six-year limit <e> <s> if the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead should succeed in his amendment he would knock my argument out of the water <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that he will not press it <e> <s> if he does i shall with the greatest confidence vote against it <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend despite his somewhat grudging undertaking with respect to looking at the question of subsection is going to do what the government are sensibly and generously doing in subsection for the doing of which they have my warm support <e>", "<cs> we have really had two lines of defence by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in successive speeches <e> <s> the first as i understand it was an administrative argument that it would be untidy to continue indefinitely the system of consular registration alongside the provisions of the bill <e> <s> that is an argument that i can understand although i think many of your lordships may feel that in certain parts of this bill that is an aspect of the matter that is being given excessive importance as compared with the wellbeing and interests of the people outside who are concerned <e>", "<cs> we have now had the further argument that this is a cut-off after five years of what we call the grandchildren <e> <s> that then gives rise to a rather curious situation if i have understood it aright and it is more than likely that i have not and my noble and learned friend will correct me if i have not <e> <s> the grandchild case that is the son of a british citizen by descent will for five years get british citizenship by registration at the consulate though he would not get it if he were in a commonwealth country where that system apparently does not apply in the same respect <e> <s> if that is right is not the bill going to create an unfair and rather odd situation that someone will be a british subject only because he has been born outside the british commonwealth <e> <s> this really seems to me to be standing logic on its head <e>", "<cs> as my name appears to the amendment i will try to deal with what appears to be the substantive argument that has been adduced against it both by my noble friend the leader of the house and with his characteristic effectiveness my noble friend lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> their argument as i understand it which was summed up by lord home is that there must be no exception and my noble friend lord soames really argued the same point if he will allow me to say so at somewhat greater length <e> <s> that argument with respect is not tenable for the government because exceptions are being made <e>", "<cs> as my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> has been so characteristically kind as to mention me in despatches may i point out to him that so far from blurring the citizenship and migration argument i was simply pointing out that the general statement being made by members of the government that no exceptions can be made in <e>", "<cs> i do not find my noble friends explanation wholly satisfying and nor do i accept his argument that there is a relationship between renouncing british citizenship and the arrangements for holding dual nationality <e> <s> to me these seem to be quite different concepts <e> <s> with respect nor did my noble friend lord belstead deal with the argument made by my noble friend lord renton that british citizenship is a thing to be prized to be regarded as something of great value and not lightly to be discarded <e> <s> after all we spent a good deal of this afternoon dealing with the position of some people who desperately want british citizenship <e> <s> so to say that just because resumption is in the present law we must facilitate its continuation by those who for some reason like to shed british citizenship is not i think a complete answer <e>", "<cs> quite right too <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply does it mean that the government have no power to check this wholly unnecessary wasteful and provocative expenditure which will fall upon the already overburdened rate-payers of london <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend clear up the one point in this debate which troubles me <e> <s> on the merits of the matter i think i am with him but i am less than clear on the argument as to whether or not the carrying of this or any other amendment would prevent the achievement of the agreed independence date of st september because if that is so then as the noble lord lord stewart of fulham has said no amendment can be made without causing a degree of disruption at the initiation of an independent state which many of us would not wish to see <e> <s> but if that is so then surely this committee as the revising chamber is being put in a position of some difficulty <e> <s> if we are taking a committee stage at a time when we are told that though we may be right on merits to make this or any other amendment we cannot do it without doing considerable public mischief by delaying the date then this does not seem to me i say it with great diffidence the right way to treat your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is necessary at this stage to add anything on appeals in entitlement cases because my noble and learned friend himself on a much earlier amendment some days ago during a debate in which i took part gave the clearest possible undertaking that the government would be looking into this between now and report stage <e> <s> i am sure that he took on board the view then expressed which has been re-echoed this afternoon by the noble lord lord mishcon that the kind of appeal in those cases will not be the kind of appeal in which the onus falls on the appellant of establishing that no reasonable secretary of state could possibly have come to the view complained of but that it will rather be a case as the noble lord lord mishcon has said of the appellate body whatever it is having the right to look at the whole facts of the case and to see the case as the home secretary originally saw it in order to see whether they come to the same view <e> <s> as is it clear that the assurances we have been given cover that then it would be premature before the report stage to say anything more on that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that notwithstanding the comments of the noble baroness opposite many of us are very glad indeed to hear this announcement of the strengthening both of the quality and of the independence of local government audits <e> <s> in view of the enormous sums of money to which he referred and in view of one or two unhappy cases in local government of which noble lords are well aware is my noble friend aware that many of us feel that this action is well timed and of very great importance <e>", "<cs> i apparently jumped the gun on this point as regards the earlier amendment of my noble friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> i am bound to say that i found the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on that occasion though adroit and suave as ever somewhat unconvincing <e> <s> on this occasion i should simply like to ask him this question <e> <s> is it clear beyond peradventure that some person who rightly or wrongly has had the home secretarys discretion exercised against an application of his and who alleges that there is here an element of discrimination on grounds of colour race or religion could take this appeal to the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that comprehensive and informative reply and congratulating the government on yesterdays announcement as to the outcome of the quiet firmness with which they have handled this dispute may i ask him whether in the light of yesterdays announcement urgent steps will now be taken if necessary by giving priority in instructions to the staff returning to duty to pay those arrears which have been as he has told the house outstanding for some little time and which despite the efforts of the government have caused very considerable hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the very deep anxiety which the situation has given rise to among the beneficiaries concerned which will not be wholly mitigated by his indication that it will be some months before payments are normal will my noble friend arrange that periodic statements be made during the recess and on the resumption of the house of the progress made in restoring normal payments <e> <s> is he aware that this is a matter of almost life and death importance for a very large proportion of the least fortunate of our fellow citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i would join with the noble and learned lord opposite in welcoming the state of the marshalled list and the indication which it gives of the response of my noble friend the minister to a good many of our discussions at the committee stage <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has said it indicates that my noble friend has listened with great care to a great deal of the argumentat <e>", "<cs> at commencement in fact <e>", "<cs> it happens <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who took part in the debates at the committee stage i too should like to thank the government and my noble and learned friend for introducing the amendment <e> <s> if i may i should also like to congratulate what has been described as the unholy alliance of my noble friend lord colville of culross and the noble lord lord gifford on their success because at the committee stage they executed a somewhat effective pincer movement against the minister <e> <s> although in a way my noble and learned friend the lord advocate i thought tried to minimise the practical consequences of the amendment i am inclined to share the view <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank my noble friend for meeting so fully the request i made for the introduction into the bill of greater flexibility over this period <e> <s> may i also add in the presence of a home office minister that in the light of recent events i am delighted that one person had a little difficulty in getting out of one of her majestys prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i very much welcome this modest extension of the benefits of clause <e> <s> may i look a gift horse in the mouth in two respects <e> <s> one regarding a drafting point and the other on a point of moderate substance <e> <s> the drafting point which i am sure my noble and learned friend can answer off the cuff is this <e> <s> has the use of the word community without any adjective in front of it such as european and the word communities been made in a statute previously or is it an innovation <e> <s> it does not appear there is any definition in the definition clause and i wonder whether it might have been more prudent as indeed is done in a later clause to preface it with the word european <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this amendment really goes too far <e> <s> the distinction which the noble lord lord elystan-morgan did not bring out between this amendment and the preceding one is that this one covers international organisations of which the british government are not a member <e> <s> admittedly if one reads it into the clause any international organisation has to be one closely associated with the activities outside the united kingdom of her majestys government <e> <s> but on a strict reading of this amendment it would cover work under the warsaw pact organisation or the comintern because they are both bodies in which in one sense the activities of her majestys government are very much involved <e> <s> it really could not be the intention to go as wide as any international organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving that answer had my noble friend in mind the fact that whereas between easter and whitsun a period of only a few weeks there are three public holidays after whitsun there is only one public holiday between the beginning of june and christmas <e> <s> is this not an odd inefficient and awkward position <e>", "<cs> my lords could we not follow the good example of our american and french opposite numbers and have a public holiday in the middle of july when humanly speaking the english climate is at its least unpleasant <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the air may days is a distress signal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to thank my noble friend for accepting the suggestion made in committee of introducing a measure of flexibility <e> <s> as he says i do not think that there will be very many cases involved but even a few cases could cause hardship and i think that this is a useful improvement in the bill <e> <s> i should like once again to thank him for having listened so attentively and for having given such care and trouble after the debate to what was said during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is dealing this afternoon not as my noble friend lord renton or the minister said with the principle which the house supported by a large majority after full debate in july we are concerned with the draftingi am sure that whatever view your lordships take or took on the issue of gibraltar we are all unanimous in the desire that the drafting which implements that decision should be as good sensible and comprehensible as we can make it <e>", "<cs> my lords i see my noble friend lady vickers this afternoon in the role of temptress <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be indelicate if i were to reply in kind to my noble friend and perhaps even discourteous <e> <s> i should hate to be discourteous to her <e> <s> but i use that expression because if one were dealing with this matter in isolation i should certainly find myself on her side <e> <s> we are dealing with a very limited number of people of british origin in an isolated position faced by wholly unjustifiable claims by the argentine which have caused alarm to them and there is little doubt that an amendment of this kind would give them a measure of assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but was it not lord palmerston <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend satisfied that wages councils now take full account of the governments policy of restraint in the level of wage increases <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness on the front bench was as always most reassuring in her assurances <e> <s> but i did note that she did not specifically answer a point which my noble friend lord renton made which certainly weighs with me <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton said that if the bill stood in its present form it would be impossible for an aggrieved parent to challenge the decision of the local authority either in the courts or in parliament <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble baroness whether she accepts that <e> <s> she did not specifically challenge it but it may be that she overlooked the point <e> <s> if she does accept it i would ask her why that is thought to be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the private sector very few pension schemes indeed are able to afford index-linking <e> <s> will she <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not begin by apologising for seeking to address your lordships without my name being on the list of speakers because i did my best last week to put it there but apparently something went wrong <e> <s> it is a mistake in this house as no doubt elsewhere to think that anyone remembers ones speeches except oneself <e> <s> but those of your lordships who were present as long ago as the second reading may possibly be reminded that i did say in an intervention then that i thought that this was a pretty poor bill and that i might have some difficulty in supporting it at later stages if improvements were not effected <e> <s> it is only fair to say that considerable improvements have been effected <e>", "<cs> my lords having said that i must admit that this is still not a very good bill <e> <s> one cannot ignore the general expressions of criticism regardless of party alignment or of party questions which it has aroused can one <e> <s> i for one cannot help being impressed by the attitude of the churches <e> <s> we all listened this afternoon with very great respect a respect due both to his office and to his personality to the most reverend primate <e> <s> one cannot overlook the fact that opinion outside academic opinion opinion among the ethnic minorities opinion in the press and opinion generally is still intensely critical of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords do not questions of this kind whose only effect if implemented would be to weaken the military power of the western alliance serve no purpose other than to strengthen the aggressive power of the soviet union <e> <s> would they not be more convincing if just occasionally an anti-nuclear demonstration were staged in the streets of moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords although i shall not support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord bruce of donington which seems to me to be a pointless exercise and although i shall not follow the example of the noble lord who has just sat down and make several speeches which were perhaps more relevant to the amendments when we come to them i think it is right that there should be at any rate one voice from this side of the house on the procedure which her majestys government have seen fit to adopt in respect of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords if statues to the recently dead are to be used as instruments of political propaganda would it not be more appropriate in view of the late lord mountbattens lifetime of devoted service in the armed forces of the crown to use the latin quotation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how glad i was to hear of the decision of his right honourable friend which my noble friend has just announced and the acceptance by the government of the special position of the people of gibraltar and the securing for them of that entitlement to british citizenship which as your lordships know means so much to them <e> <s> this seems a very wise and sensible decision and i know that it was a hard one for her majestys government to make because to some extent it damages the tidiness and the pattern of the bill <e> <s> but tidiness is not the most important thing in legislation <e> <s> we are dealing here with human beings and i have already heard from gibraltar what pleasure has been caused among these loyal people at the announcement that parliament in its combined wisdom is now securing to them this citizenship <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him two questions <e> <s> where do the government think wages councils are still necessary and secondly are the government satisfied that the present wages councils decisions are consistent with the governments general policy on moderation in wage increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid my noble friend misunderstood my question <e> <s> i asked him whether the government were satisfied that wages councils did conduct themselves in that way or whether they did not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask two questions of my noble friend <e> <s> is she aware of the fact that many of us who served at the treasury at the time when the treasury was responsible for the civil service never understood the wisdom of removing that responsibility in and therefore welcome very much the return of a good deal of it as announced in the statement that has been made <e> <s> but will my noble friend explain a little further why it has been thought necessary to split the responsibility and in particular whether i hope my noble friend will not think that this question sounds too materialistic it really makes sense to leave morale the responsibility of one side and pay the responsibility of the other <e> <s> is there not perhaps a necessary link between the two <e> <s> would my noble friend be prepared to say that further consideration will be given to restoring the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that modestly encouraging reply may i take it from this that her majestys government do not intend to maintain a situation in which the authority of government is used to give a strong competitive advantage to foreign airlines in competition with the state-owned british one <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of my noble friends comments about overcrowding at heathrow would not a very simple and quick way of dealing with the problem be to inform iberia and tap that they would be most welcome at gatwick but not at heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read the motion in the name of the noble lord lord evans of claughton i speculated as to what general reforms of local government the noble lord and his political colleagues had in mind <e> <s> i am bound to say that i suspected that the only point of substance that he would want to put forward would be to bring forward again what i hope he will not mind my describing as the liberal partys obsession with fancy forms of franchise <e> <s> i put that thought from me as being uncharitable but i find to my regret because i am a charitable man that i was right <e> <s> those who listened to the noble lords speech delightfully delivered as it was will i think agree with me that apart from some generalities and i will not call them platitudes about the desirability of preserving the independence of local government and a glancing blow at a measure which is at the moment in another place basically the only practical recommendation which the noble lord put forward to the house was the introduction into local government elections of the single transferable vote <e> <s> so far as the mover of this motion was concerned that is his idea of what this debate should be about <e>", "<cs> my lords it was certainly part of the labour party policy and i think insofar as it was confirmed in it helped to contribute to their defeat <e> <s> for that reason i hope that they will continue to put it in their manifesto <e> <s> but that does not get away from the point that under our system of the local administration of education some local authorities had been elected on the basis of retaining their selective grammar schools as was the case of the local authority in my own late constituency of kingston-upon-thames and there was here a clear legislative attempt to override local government on a matter within its own administrative sphere <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will bear that in mind when he makes these general statements about overriding local government and when as perhaps may be the case later this session we have to discuss this matter in another context <e>", "<cs> he is a conscript <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has taken me to task for referring to the speech of his noble friend as containing platitudes about the independence of local government and he went on to quote the action of the present secretary of state for education in rejecting manchester city councils proposals on sixth forms <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that whether sir keith was right or wrong in that as an interference in the rights of local government that pales into insignificance as compared with the action of mrs shirley williams in seeking to dictate to all local authorities that they should abolish their selective <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the situation is becoming increasingly acute <e> <s> that if as is stated in the press the government permit the operation of larger vehicles than at present it will become even more acute <e> <s> is he also aware that the greater london council with whom as he said primary responsibility lies is withdrawing the safeguarding of the routes which are required to provide proper diversionary roads round london <e> <s> in those circumstances in view of the fact that the national capital is involved can my noble friend assure me that in default of early effective action by the glc the government will take powers if necessary by legislation and do it themselves <e>", "<cs> which is which <e>", "<cs> my lords in accordance with the custom of the house i should at this stage declare an interest as chairman of a company which employs a substantial number of workers and which might well stand to benefit from a number of the proposals which are being put forward in the debate <e> <s> having said that i am sure that the house is indebted to the noble lord lord spens for raising this immensely important and significant subject though i part company with him i am sorry to say in respect of the phraseology that he has used <e> <s> his motion could be construed as suggesting that all employers should be encouraged to increase their workforces <e> <s> i fear that that must not be so <e> <s> certainly there are a number of employers in particular in the public sector who are still grossly overmanned and whose competitiveness if i may pick up the argument of the noble baroness is weakened by their overmanning for example british steel or british airways <e> <s> however so far as the private sector is concerned and some parts of the public sector that are operating reasonably profitably it must make sense to facilitate the expansion of their labour forces <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend wish me to assist him <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said so rightly that this surcharge was a cost but does he appreciate that it is a cost not borne by our foreign competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me he has very nearly got it right <e> <s> what i was really trying to suggest was that the noble earl with his habitual ability was making the best possible defence of the wholly indefensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does his statement that no further reductions are planned exclude the possibility of nonetheless making them <e> <s> does my noble friend recall that it was this organisation which last year was responsible for the extremely expensive error in calculation which resulted in greatly increased public expenditure on teachers salaries <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of us will feel that the only criticism which could be directed against his right honourable friend on this matter is an excess of patience with an obviously recalcitrant and obstructive authority <e> <s> can he give an assurance that in the other cases to which the noble baroness opposite invited his attention his right honourable friend will take similar resolute action if it is necessary to ensure that council tenants secure the rights which parliament intends them to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that very informative reply may i ask whether he can add to his kindness by indicating how much revenue lost during the period of the dispute has not yet been recovered and what that figure must mean in charges additional to those which he a moment ago reported to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend answer the second part of my supplementary question <e> <s> the recovery of billion being delayed does it not mean further interest charges additional to those which he has already indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> as i was a little involved in the transaction to which he has just referred is he aware that so far from this bill being talked out after a considerable body of discussion had taken place it was withdrawn by the government of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords as the debate on the bill of my noble friend lord alport has been interrupted i believe i can best serve your lordships if i first of all make two points in reply to the noble lord lord jacques before returning to discuss the major issues of policy which my noble friend lord alport raised in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that intervention one of intense interest because what the noble lord has said and i do not think that he has quite realised it is that despite their majority of there was so little support on the governments side in the house of commons for this bill that he could not have got a guillotine through in the face of what he describes as obstruction <e> <s> this is an extremely interesting admission albeit years late <e> <s> does the noble lord want to add to it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and the noble lord will know that he did not do anything even though he had a majority of <e> <s> of course he knows with respect that he did not do anything because he knew he did not have support even among his own large majority in another place for a guillotine because it was generally understood in his party as in mine that this was a rotten bad proposition for a bill and it was better dropped <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry my lords but i have given way twice <e> <s> i am dealing at the moment with the noble lord lord jacques but if the noble lord lord beswick wishes to intervene on something that i say later then perhaps he would so indicate <e> <s> the noble lord lord jacques said something that astonished me <e> <s> he said not only that he personally proposed to support this bill which of course he is perfectly entitled to do as a member of this place but that he knew of nothing in it inconsistent with the policy of his party in his so doing <e> <s> my lords it is common knowledge that the policy of the party of which he is an ornament is to abolish this house <e> <s> this has been affirmed by his partys conference which i understand is now sovereign in these matters and repeated by the leader of his party whose services on the and occasions i would at this point gratefully acknowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord jacques will always be free to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while warmly congratulating her majestys government on the subject matter of that answer and my noble friend in particular in view of the well-known efforts he has made in this direction may i ask him why the re-opening of the border originally promised to him in april is deferred until april and not effected immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend has just said and the sorry story he <e>", "<cs> my lords although in the economic situation which faces our country today it may well be that a measure of this kind is needed i am bound to say that no one who has been associated with social security administration for any length of time is likely to welcome it with uncritical enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell is only repeating what the noble baroness has said that national insurance contributions only fell i will not say in the lower tranches of income because i believe that i am right in saying that they now go up to a week which are substantial earnings even these days <e> <s> the noble lord is only saying what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i am glad he agrees with me that the crucial figures are the cumulative effect of the two <e> <s> as the noble lord himself said it is a fact that on the higher tranches of income leaving national insurance contributions aside altogether

would the noble lord address his mind to this aspect of the matter <e> <s> does he not accept that experience has shown that very high levels of taxation on persons whose earnings are apparently high because they are regarded as valuable people has resulted again and again in one of two things happening <e> <s> either they have gone abroad and we have lost their services or alternatively the incentive and the vigour that they ought to be putting into leading our economy and the rest of us into prosperity has been weakened <e> <s> surely if there is anything to be learned from the experience of the governments which the noble lord supported it is that and it has a great deal to do with the mess they left the country in <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me to intervene at this point <e> <s> it would would it not have been perfectly possible as an alternative simply to have reduced the rate of the surcharge on the employers national insurance contribution

little more importance than the noble lord the lord chairman indicated he did to what i think is the very real problem at this moment and that is the difficulty of getting a question relating to a topical matter down for answer within a reasonable time <e> <s> the noble lord the lord chairman told us that in fact the order paper is at the moment full for the whole month during which one is permitted to put down questions and as the house will recall the right honourable gentleman the member for huyton said a week is a long time in politics <e> <s> it is the fact that matters arise about which some of your lordships in all parts of the house may want to ask a starred question and they simply cannot do it for at least a month and with respect that seems to weaken the value of your lordships house as a body entitled to investigate and inquire into the responsibilities and activities of government <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures whch my noble friend gave to the house constitute a grave warning to those who earn their living on the railways and are engaged at the moment in disrupting their services <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that i wonder whether he would answer a question which has been puzzling me throughout this short debate <e> <s> he seems to see here a great question of principle <e> <s> he has a gift for identifying questions of principle which are not always so clearly apparent to other noble lords <e> <s> he accepts as i understand it that it is right that the class contributor should contribute some part of his national insurance contribution to pay for unemployment benefit to help him should he have the misfortune to become unemployed <e> <s> having accepted that why is it so wrong that that class contributor should also contribute towards the cost of another benefit which is also directly related to the contingency of becoming unemployed that is to the redundancy payment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is kind enough to attribute to me expertise which i certainly do not claim <e> <s> surely with very great respect to her that is a very weak argument <e> <s> she is admitting that the employee is under an illusion in believing that his redundancy payment comes solely from his employer <e> <s> surely the existence of that illusion is one of the weakest possible arguments against making a provision of this sort and making this benefit contributory <e> <s> the point is very easily dealt with by explanation <e> <s> in most well-run companies with which i have any connection i know that the general systems of social and other benefits are explained with considerable clarity sometimes with reiteration to those concerned <e> <s> and those i have dealt with understand it perfectly well <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment or objecting to clause standing part the noble baroness opposite really repeated rather more briefly what she said on the second reading of the bill <e> <s> i think we know her views <e> <s> i would only if i may put this to her <e> <s> her view is quite simple given the heavy calls on the fund at the moment the additional money required and she accepts of course that additional money is required should be raised out of national taxation and particularly out of direct national taxation <e> <s> i wonder if she has considered this thought <e> <s> the essence of the national insurance scheme from the beginning has been that it has been a basically contributory scheme that because people contribute they have been entitled to their benefits as of right <e> <s> there has always been an exchequer contribution and we may come to another amendment dealing with the quantum of that <e> <s> but it has basically from the beginning back to lord beveridge been a contributory scheme and that has been the justification for the payment of benefits as of right without means test <e> <s> if the noble baroness pushes too hard the idea that the national insurance scheme should become taxation supported she will undoubtedly generate a demand for the erosion of the benefit as of right concept <e> <s> she will succeed in destroying i agree with her it has been damaged but it has not been eliminated the insurance concept <e> <s> i think she will have done a great deal of harm to the whole social security system of this country <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord spens were to press this matter to a division i would certainly vote against him simply on the basis that i do not think it is within the conventions governing the relationship of this place and another place to legislate on matters of taxation and i think from the indications which the noble lord had given that he shares that view <e> <s> but i should not like for that reason to let his amendment be withdrawn without <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us are glad to see that ministers in this position are not always taking the easy course of passing responsibilities over to a public inquiry but rather than face the delay and expense which the public inquiries involve arc taking decisions for which they take responsibility <e> <s> is this not a very good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that answer may i ask her whether an index-linked pension which protects the recipient from the effects of inflation is not regarded as a proper acknowledgement of faithful service and is it not a little repulsive that people who on their own admission have betrayed their trust and let down their country should be receiving it <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting the noble leaders statement of the law on the merits of the matter is not the position of someone who has confessed fully to treachery but who for some reason or other has not been prosecuted morally exactly the same as that of the person who has been successfully prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords i would make only one point on the motion that the bill do now pass and that is to remind your lordships that as is brought out in the financial and explanatory memorandum one effect i think i am right in saying one side-effect <e>", "<cs> my lords but is it not the fact that the luncheon voucher was introduced to give <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe as he was speaking recalled to me as it may have done to others of your lordships the late mr ramsay macdonald <e> <s> he has so attractive a voice that it is only after he has finished speaking

me to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will tell me to which of my right honourable friends many interesting inspiring and stimulating observations he is referring i shall be in a better position to identify but he will appreciate that warm supporter as i am of the prime minister i should not like to give him a completely blank cheque of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that what the prime minister said at melbourne made very good sense and was very rightly said at that place <e> <s> if that is what is worrying the noble lord i can reassure him at once <e> <s> if i may come to the point that i was on this country is facing a situation of the very greatest difficulty <e> <s> the government are having to do unpopular things and no doubt as a result of that are unpopular <e> <s> this touches on a point of very great seriousness indeed which goes beyond our present troubles <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be per cent <e> <s> certain that parliamentary democracy as we know it and a prosperous free enterprise society can necessarily continue to co-exist <e> <s> there is an inveterate temptation <e>", "<cs> my lords none of them is here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name of the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend confirm that the select committee in another place was particularly critical of the commissions exercise of its very important power in respect of grants and are the government considering seeking from the commission if these powers are to remain there assurances that these powers will be more effectively and intelligently used in the future than they apparently have been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not difficult to justify retention by local authorities of money paid in response to a demand which has unlawful <e> <s> if an authority so acts is it not putting itself in legal peril <e>", "<cs> my lords it is so rare for an impost of any kind actually to be reduced even in the short term that i am sure my noble friend deserves congratulations upon it even though he is offering the reduction for only six months <e> <s> however i hope that in accepting the congratulations my noble friend will not delude himself into thinking they mean that some of us who have always disliked the principle of the levy have been wholly appeased <e> <s> if my mathematics are right we are perhaps appeased by only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he be kind enough to answer the question of mine which he apparently overlooked as to whether when we come up to august and when under this order the charge will revert to and if the fund looks to be reasonably prosperous he will look again at that figure and see whether it cannot be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords as it so happened just before i rose at that conference my noble friend lord home of the hirsel then the earl of home arrived from london holding a piece of paper which the or people in the hall knew contained the decision which mr macmillan had made as to his future and the future leadership of the country and of the government <e> <s> your lordships can well imagine that because the iron convention which dominates these conferences prevented my noble friend getting up and reading it at once and inflicted instead my long carefully thought-out much argued-over government pronouncement on rates my observations on that occasion commanded remarkably little attention <e> <s> indeed even <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to intervene <e> <s> she is perfectly correct in saying that rates are a tax related to property but in the case of companies they have to be paid for out of the profits and on the figures that i gave to the house earlier the total rate burden has risen over industry as a whole from one-sixth of pre-tax profits to one-half <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords and noble baronesses who have taken part in the debate for making this debate what those who like myself have sat through it will feel as my noble friend lord bellwin said to have been a very valuable one <e> <s> indeed one could say that this was an example of this house performing one of its important functions because although it would be an affectation to pretend that there were not at times flashes of party controversy even a little trading in manifestoes none the less the essence of the debate was a contribution by noble lords and noble baronesses with practical experience to the consideration of what all of us appreciate to be an exceedingly difficult and complex problem <e> <s> if this house can do that mobilise this amount of opinion experience argument then it seems to me that this house is going to endure and flourish for a great many years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give an assurance and indicate to both sides of the railway industry that there can be no question of further substantial government investment in the railway industry until some progress has been achieved in improving productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not wholly wrong in principle for a public body that has obtained money from the citizen by aid of a demand which subsequently has been shown to be invalid in law to retain it <e> <s> does my noble friend appreciate that it is precisely the people who need this money back the most the widow the pensioner and so on who do not read the law reports and therefore probably do not ask for it back <e>", "<cs> my lords might i ask my noble friend three questions on his most interesting statement <e> <s> first of all will the charges be calculated fully to recover the cost of treating the individual concerned <e> <s> secondly how does my noble friend and his right honourable friend propose to deal with the case of a person coming from a tropical country who develops a highly infectious disease which it is of great importance to us should be treated speedily in hospital in isolation <e> <s> is he satisfied that these arrangements will not deter that person from doing what is very much in our countrys interests and getting quickly into hospital <e> <s> thirdly will the noble lords right honourable friend continue to seek to negotiate reciprocal agreements with other countries that offer comparable health services <e> <s> it is apparent that if he does he will lose a little revenue at home but is my noble friend aware of the enormous value of these reciprocal agreements to those of our fellow countrymen who travel abroad <e> <s> will he give an assurance that his right honourable friend will still seek to negotiate reciprocal agreements when opportunity offers <e>", "<cs> before the third reading <e>", "<cs> the committee is indebted to the noble lord lord stewart for clarifying two important aspects both of the bill and of the amendment <e> <s> on his first point i agree with him that the bill as it stands would bring in the referendum procedure even for a trifling reduction in our powers and that is ridiculous <e> <s> it is however a defect of the bill and not i suggest a defect of the amendment <e> <s> we then come to the more substantial point lord stewart made on the amendment <e> <s> i agree with what he said as to the effect of the amendment if accepted in a situation in which the abolition or enfeeblement measure originated in this house <e> <s> i think we can dismiss as a hypothesis about which we need not bother the concept of an abolition measure proceeding very far here it is extremely unlikely that it would pass second reading except in the situation in which mr wedgwood benn had carried out his plan to create peers and if that were to <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that the issue could be discussed on a motion <e> <s> he did not wish us to discuss the bill <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord lord jacques who has considerable experience not least as one of our deputy chairmen there is all the difference in the world between debating a bill stage by stage with the general principles on second reading the details in committee and some further details on report and taking a one-day general debate <e> <s> that applies not least from the practical point of view in that the media are given an opportunity several times to put forward to the people the views expressed in this house <e> <s> that is why if we are to have this procedure i attach great importance to the point that we should secure as the amendment even in its present form secures that this house has the opportunity to discuss the matter before it goes to referendum <e>", "<cs> it is normal practice in this house for those supporting an amendment to have the last word and i thought that my noble friend lord eccles had been exercising that right when he waited before he rose for my noble friend lord alport to rise <e> <s> as that turned out to be a misapprehension i will not detain the committee for long <e> <s> but i cannot allow my noble friend lord alport to get away with the reiteration of his obsession that this amendment is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> take the situation which he adumbrated <e> <s> an abolition bill comes to this house <e> <s> it would then having passed the commons if this amendment is in force be open to this house either to throw it out on second reading or if they decided to show greater wisdom than to ask for its destruction under the parliament act for this house not to throw it out on second reading but having that confidence in the people about which my noble friend lord alport spoke so eloquently on second reading to let it go to the later stages in order to get the advantage of a referendum which as my noble friend obviously thinks for this is the purpose of his bill would result in the salvation of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether what he said about the position of the district auditor in respect of this publication also applies to the full page advertisements in the press containing nothing but straight political propaganda which have equally been issued by the glc recently <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that all experience including that of the last war is that the vast russian stock of these horrible weapons is much less likely to be used if those who <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who had the privilege of serving under lord butler as financial secretary during the epic first three years of his term as chancellor of the exchequer may i add just a few words about my old chief <e> <s> some of your lordships will remember that winston churchill entrusted the whole management of the finance and economy of this country to rab butler and although rab had not had any previous experience in an economic department

service and the complete mastery of the intricacies of macroeconomics which he so rapidly acquired and which enabled him to handle a very grave economic crisis with conspicuous success <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that extremely interesting answer is this an area of government expenditure which is being critically looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not an appropriate tribute to the standard of british nurses that they should be so much in demand abroad <e> <s> is it not

lordships house that i feel nonetheless free so to do and to say what i know all of your lordships who are here feel that we have had the great advantage of listening to one of the most impressive

issue owes an enormous amount to the calm firmness of the leadership of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the dockyard at gibraltar is rendering very considerable service at this moment in the present crisis <e> <s> in view of the fact that whatever else results from the present crisis there will plainly have to be a review of defence arrangements

a very distinguished trade union statesman in the person of mr gormley will be joining this house <e> <s> i only regret that he is not here already to take part in this debate to which am certain he would make a characteristically vigorous contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i could not believe that a humane person such as the noble lord is known to be would have wished to defer the payments to be made under clause to people whom most of us in this house regard as seriously wronged <e> <s> that does not mean that i go with the noble lord in the argument which he has now explained he was making that one should defer the ballot arrangements in clause <e> <s> i think the noble lord will agree that this is an enormously important matter and surely in matters of this importance affecting as they do the lives of very many individuals it would be a great pity to defer any longer than administrative factors make necessary the bringing into force of these salutary provisions <e> <s> what is more it would then leave the whole subject a matter of controversy to be argued on election platforms and perhaps deferred for quite a time <e> <s> so i am afraid that although the humanitarian considerations do not apply to the same degree though they apply to some degree to the suggestion about clause as they do to clause i must none the less differ from the noble lord on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that addition which seems to me to be wholly consistent with the passage which i quoted <e> <s> if the noble lord would like as it were a second reading of his book <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of that position <e> <s> the noble lords knowledge of the civil service unions is unequalled in the house <e> <s> he turned the inland revenue staff association into a most formidable body <e> <s> but that with respect does not alter the general point which i was making that it should be i did not say that it was a condition of their service that they should not take industrial action <e> <s> what arrangements should then in the future be made in respect

situation if the position were as i was suggesting it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords what nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> is it not the fact that the

my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that comprehensive reply may i ask whether he is aware that most of it appeared to relate to action by her majestys government and remarkably little to the inaction of the greater london council <e> <s> will he in particular discuss with the glc with whom as he says the power lies the question of following the example of for instance paris and rome and forbidding very large vehicles to traverse the centre of the city <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for what seemed to me to be a rather promising reply may i ask him and his right honourable friend to reflect on whether the old system under which the london transport board was responsible to the minister of transport and therefore was in parallel with the railways board with which it has co-operated so closely did not work much more satisfactorily than the present system and whether there is not every case for reverting to it <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the supplementary question put by the noble lord lord underhill is it not the fact that the transport system of the national capital is used by a very large number of people who are not ratepayers in the capital and does it not follow that if there is to be a subsidy for the transport system of the national capital it should be subsidised nationally and therefore controlled nationally <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the vast majority of people who recognise that the main threat to peace comes from the possibility of russian aggression are delighted to see our american allies taking steps to equip themselves for that quick action in an emergency which can prevent trouble from spreading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that although the customs and excise may maintain that this leaflet does not involve an exposition of any change in the law in fact vat has not been levied over many years in this class of case <e> <s> is he aware also that there has been no statutory change in the law and some of us are wondering a little why it is that the customs and excise having been quite happy to leave this matter sensibly untouched for many years should suddenly be taking this initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that his answer to the noble baroness lady airey that the tax can be avoided by withdrawing the objects in question from public view will merely mean that many members of the public who would have enjoyed the sight of these lovely things will be deprived of them as a result of an action by the customs and excise which will produce remarkably little revenue in exchange <e>", "<cs> it is refreshing to begin the committee stage of the bill with an effort an unaccustomed effort on the part of the opposition front bench to press for restraint and control over public expenditure <e> <s> i only hope that on other measures the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton will infect his colleagues with similar zeal perhaps in cases where more public money is involved and where the merits of the expenditure are less obvious than they are in this case <e> <s> the noble lord on the front bench opposite exercised all his impressive forensic abilities to try to turn this really rather modest matter into a major issue of principle and of policy <e> <s> but what the amendment that i think he was moving seeks to do is simply to provide paving for a number of subsequent amendments which would formalise delay and prolong matters and would involve considerable additional administrative expenditure in respect of the fairly simple and straightforward issue dealt with by clause <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> as i understand it the position is that the comptroller and auditor-general and the exchequer audit department with their staff of between and are working through the departments throughout the year <e> <s> of course a great deal of what they ascertain never comes before the public accounts committee but any irregularity any making of payments which should not have been made even though the amounts are small they would normally find it necessary to draw to the attention of the committee and the committee would feel it its duty to deal with it <e>", "<cs> what has this to do with the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the speech of the noble lord lord mccarthy confirmed again the idea which appears to be held opposite that professor gennard is not only relevant to every amendment to the bill but is also the vehicle of quasi-divine inspiration i for one should be grateful if one of the noble lords opposite would tell me who he is because i think that it might be of interest <e>", "<cs> the speech of the noble lord lord oram was if he will allow me to say so much more reasonable than that of his noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord oram that there could well be cases of people who having joined a union then withdrew their membership for quite inadequate and indeed perhaps even unworthy reasons they did not want to pay

lord wedderburn has ignored a little the basis of this part of the bill <e> <s> my understanding is that it involves a compromise between those who hold the view which i am inclined to hold that the closed shop is an abomination and that we should proceed as many of our friends in europe have done to outlaw it and those who like noble lords opposite regard it as a very important accessory to trade union power <e> <s> i quoted on second reading the very significant revealing words which the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord not misrepresent me <e> <s> i said specifically that what the government were proposing with the ballot was a compromise which i supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my

considerable number of years <e> <s> certainly he showed this afternoon that he was on the top of his form as an advocate <e> <s> his account of his dealings in the war office with the civilian staffs rang true and i think had a considerable effect on your lordships <e> <s> but on reflection we realise that in a closed shop atmosphere the sort of person who will stand out and insist on his right

shoulders and join <e> <s> he will take the line of least resistance <e> <s> only the awkward type the type if you like that the noble lord described the one who passed by the cap without putting in a

have the government any views on that or indeed do the terms of the amendments limit that <e> <s> secondly would he bear in mind that although the shipping industry is making in the view of some of us perhaps rather appropriately very heavy weather of this it is probably a more real problem in the airline industry where members of the staff are dispersed throughout the world and moving very rapidly so that indeed on some days during different hours on those days they are both sides of the international date line <e>", "<cs> may i follow something which my noble friend lord gowrie said which interested me a great deal <e> <s> everything he says interests me a great deal <e> <s> he expounded with considerable eloquence the philosophy of the step-by-step approach to the problem of the closed shop <e> <s> i do not want to argue with him about that <e> <s> on that he may be right <e> <s> what i should like to ask is this <e> <s> in what direction are those steps going to be directed was he telling us in careful language that the government policy was to abolish the closed shop as many of our european friends have done but that as a matter of tactics or of tact they wanted to do it by instalments <e> <s> or was he merely saying that they wish to deal with the various evils that the closed shop generates <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton spent a certain amount of his extremely vigorous speech upon referring to the difficulties which this clause might involve for local authorities in certain circumstances <e> <s> the noble lord can reassure himself <e> <s> no local authority need put itself in this position <e> <s> no local authority need use its position as employer to dismiss people because they will not join a union or will not join a particular union <e> <s> any local authority can protect itself from the dangers to which the noble lord referred by refraining from that kind of conduct <e> <s> the noble lord did not seem to appreciate the particular indelicacy of labour-controlled authorities doing just that <e> <s> it is one of the well known facts of political life that the trade union movement is the major support of the labour party <e> <s> it provides the greater part of the funds the greater part of the support <e> <s> for labour in control of a local authority to use its power to further the interests of the unions who support it at the expense of those people who do not want to join a union is in my view an outrageous abuse of power <e> <s> if a local authority does that it deserves what it gets because it has brought it upon itself <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> that is a somewhat chilling reference <e> <s> it is not an indication of a realisation of what it means to somebody particularly as the noble lord said on an earlier amendment in the present employment situation in this country to be dismissed and what an enormously serious thing it is <e> <s> therefore when it is done in circumstances which the noble lord now says may be unjustifiable the award that he should receive should be very substantial indeed <e> <s> and the substantiality of that award is the very gravamen of the noble lords attack <e>", "<cs> surely the answer to the worry of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is that no decent honourably conducted trade union would allow a shop steward involved in payment of compensation in the circumstances that we are discussing to pay the compensation out of his own pocket <e> <s> any honourably conducted union would stand behind him just as any other good organisation would <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that the union with which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney was very much concerned perhaps he is still concerned with it would undoubtedly behave in that way <e> <s> i do not know any union that would leave the shop steward high and dry <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> is the noble lord such a conservative that he can never change his mind in the light of changing facts <e>", "<cs> my lords whether my noble friends reply be helpful or not is it not at any rate more helpful than the recent intervention by the leader of her majestys governments opposition <e>", "<cs> this debate so far has been immensely revealing in that it has shown that the normally moderate lord underhill and the normally immoderate

telephone services <e> <s> would he tell me whether having disposed after the next election of per cent <e> <s> of the stock in british telecommunications the government intend to retain the remaining per cent <e> <s> indefinitely and if so why <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that admirable reply is he nonetheless aware that the efforts of the magnificent staff who are remaining at their posts are at many great hospitals such as st thomas across the river being gravely impeded

much shorter than years to elapse before he next addresses us <e> <s> listening to the maiden speeches of both of my noble friends i could not help thinking what a powerful argument their presence in the house is for the existence of your lordships house as at present constituted because here we are able to draw on reserves of experience and practical knowledge of the working of the british economy at a high level which though comparisons are invidious it would not be possible for another place to match <e>", "<cs> fair enough <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i am afraid it must be my fault that he must have misunderstood me <e> <s> my reference to going abroad was the well-known fact that a number of high taxpayers have taken themselves abroad because of the

not such a debate be most appropriately conducted during the dinner adjournment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that somebody from these benches should say just two <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when a group of wealthy argentines during the recent conflict took advertising space in the press they attached considerable weight to the allegation that under the british nationality act the falklanders were not given the fullest rights of citizenship <e> <s> would it not be a very proper acknowledgement of the loyalty and devotion of these people under desperately trying conditions for parliament now to confer this on them <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend reconsider his suggestion that to legislate in honour of people who have fought loyally by our side is not really accurately or properly described as propaganda warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle as the noble lord lord marsh has just said of the pre-strike ballot is one that does command a great deal of support in all parts of this house and in all sections of the country <e> <s> it is a fact that a major strike in a major industry is likely to affect for better or worse the wellbeing of the whole industry and of all those who work in it <e> <s> i therefore start with a bias very much in favour if practicable of letting the membership of a union have a say before the grave step of taking strike action is called <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord aylestone for whom i have always had enormous admiration will not mind my saying that i think it is a pity that this very important general issue comes before this house on so inadequately framed an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> that was not the question i asked <e> <s> my question was what would happen if despite the provisions of the law assuming this to be enacted the union leadership called a strike without taking a ballot at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a worker employed the noble lord said an employer as a slip of the tongue <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of my noble friend lord mottistone raises a point of great seriousness <e> <s> the background to it as your lordships may be aware is this <e> <s> since in one form or another there has been an immunity from legal action for people taking part in a trade dispute <e> <s> sometimes it has been wider sometimes it has been narrower but there has always been and under this bill there continues to be an immunity in respect of participation in a trade dispute <e> <s> the point that this amendment raises is whether such immunity should be continued in the case of action which may be endangering health or life <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had any doubts as to the validity of the amendment of my noble friend lord mottistone they would have been resolved by the speech of the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> lord mccarthys patent antipathy to the person who is dismissed for refusing to join a union went right through his speech <e> <s> it is really no argument against this proposal to say as he said with some force that there are other people dismissed for other reasons whose compensation also ought to be looked into <e> <s> i think that he may well be right about that <e> <s>

people have grievances is a reason for not remedying this situation <e> <s> now i shall give way to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords memory as ever is meticulously accurate but it does not enable him to get away from the point that unless one is adopting the equality of misery approach there is no reason for refusing to rectify one wrong because other wrongs are not at the same time being rectified <e> <s> that is the point which the noble lord with all his adroitness will not evade <e> <s> there is another one <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the noble lord at all <e>

reason that in his view other people are not having their injustices remedied <e> <s> with great respect to the other noble lord who has intervened the fact that on a totally different point not closely related to this bill at all the government have not seen fit and i have not seen fit either to advocate changes is no argument whatever as to why this comparatively small as my noble friend

committee and not merely confined to one quarter <e> <s> i wonder whether he can ease the position a little by giving us some help in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm why it

london that they are not indefinitely going to have to find ever-increasing sums of money to finance this extravagant pantomime across the river <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the previous question is my noble friend aware that some years back london transport was answerable to the minister of transport and in the case certainly of one former minister of transport it was most admirably administered <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that over the new year a great many post office boxes were not cleared between st december and th january and is not such a cessation of service by a nationalised monopoly a matter of considerable concern to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>",

will no doubt result in the bill being framed in adequate and proper legal form <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is to be congratulated and i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will give some indication that her majestys governments assistance to the measure does not terminate at this stage but that on the contrary if your lordships house passes the bill in its amended form

that the continued obstruction of access to the territory of a friendly power would be quite inconsistent with membership of the european commiunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask him whether he can confirm that the foreign office have not issued a certificate to the effect that these premises are diplomatic premises <e> <s> if that be so can he also confirm that there is nothing in law to prevent the camden council from applying for a distress warrant as they would for any other defaulting ratepayer <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of years during which these rates have not been paid has there not been more than ample opportunity over the years for any case that this building was immune from rates to be made deployed and argued <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm that this has not been done <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell your lordships on the basis of what independent technical advice the government believe that any airport in the world with only one runway could handle million passengers a year <e>",

take the opportunity of repeating to my noble friend lord elton the question which i put to him at an earlier stage of the bill and which no doubt inadvertently he did not answer on that occasion <e>

had made available to my noble friend in getting the drafting right he would give us some assurance that in another place the influence of the government would also be favourably directed towards its passage <e>", "<cs> my lords as he knows i have been for many years a devoted admirer of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i listened this afternoon to his most gallant effort to if i may so phrase it steam himself and the house up into a belief that this small bill and as i shall say in a few moments i think this mouse of a bill was a massive onslaught on local democracy <e> <s> not only did that seem to carry the technique of exaggeration to a level which while perhaps acceptable in another place is rather unusual in this house it was also significant in that in seeking to raise indignation on this matter the noble lord lord underhill at no point in his speech and i am subject to his correction expressed the slightest sympathy for the position of the ratepayer nor for that matter did the noble lord lord tordoff from the liberal benches <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think that she did not follow my argument to its logical conclusion which i beg her to do <e> <s> it is that while what she has just said is wholly true and highly advantageous such subsidy being in the national interest in respect of such people should be

lord lord cledwyn may recall in february i had the privilege as minister of transport of performing the opening ceremony of the current bridge which as he so well put it replaced telfords masterpiece

cledwyn will recall how appalling was the congestion on that vital north wales road i believe that bridge has served its turn and has not been wholly discreditable to the wonderful setting in which it

controlling the greater london council today will not only impose very severe hardship on a great many of the citizens of london but will also to a considerable measure frustrate the policies of her majestys government on incomes and prices <e> <s> in those circumstances are the government prepared to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not on the other hand unfair to the greater london council to criticise them for adorning the facade of county hall with the london unemployment figures in view of the fact that their own high rate policies have contributed so much to those figures and they are therefore only proclaiming their own achievements <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth is right on the technicalities and that the amendment moved by the noble lord lord tanlaw will not stand up but i must confess that i was a trifle disappointed that my noble <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not being offensive when i say that the amendments from the other side of the committee have been largely wrecking ones <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord underhill went so far as to admit that on the previous one <e>", "<cs> that is what the noble lord said <e> <s>

that view <e> <s> on the other hand i think <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has raised an interesting question <e> <s> is she arguing that the local authority should be allowed to levy any burden it

words of the amendment in the result we are both against it <e>", "<cs> but we get there <e>", "<cs> we seem to have strayed a little from the relatively narrow terms of a not very important amendment which technically we are discussing <e> <s> for that i suppose that all your lordships including myself must accept a measure of responsibility but i rise now only to say two things <e> <s> first i should like to ask your lordships to pay great attention to the warning given by my noble friend lord plummer <e> <s> as your lordships know he has an experience which is equalled only by that of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey although my noble friends experience is somewhat longer of the managing of the largest of all our local authorities <e> <s> his warning on the effect of the rate policies for which transport policies have been very largely responsible of that authority on employment in greater london and on the prosperity of greater london is one that i believe your lordships will not want to disregard <e> <s> i am quite sure it is one that the people of london outside will not disregard <e>", "<cs> yes i did not misrepresent or misunderstand the noble baroness <e> <s> she said precisely what i was saying a few moments ago but she said it as is characteristic of her more clearly <e> <s> it is that proposition which i should wish to challenge <e> <s> in that situation you can have a local authority and i am thinking particularly of the great metropolitan authorities and we had some figures on second reading carrying the burden of the taxation which they impose and the volume of expenditure in which they indulge to a point that is damaging to the national economy as a whole <e>", "<cs> i have promised to give way to the noble lord lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> i can only comment in reply to the noble lord lord tordoff that that is not what the noble baroness lady stedman said <e> <s> she did not say that a local authority should be curbed in these circumstances but by means of another sort of legislation <e> <s> she said bluntly that it should not be curbed at all if it had its electors suport <e> <s> on the other point the damage at the moment is being done most conspicuously through the over-subsidisation of transport undertakings <e> <s> the matter is of great urgency in this country <e> <s> though there is certainly an argument for reforming the whole basis of local government finance that would take a considerable time and when there is a leak as there now is in the bottom of the boat it is better to plug it with the instrument adapted to it in this case a transport bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey carries a certain amount of conviction with me at any rate when he talks about the danger of accumulating excessive staffs at different levels <e> <s> but to my mind he spoilt that argument when he said that the job was at present being done perfectly properly by the authorities and the executives <e> <s> if that were really so there would have been no need for this bill <e> <s> it is because of the failure of those authorities and executives to keep their demands on the ratepayers down to a reasonable level that the government have thought fit and in my view very rightly and perhaps even a little belatedly thought fit to bring forward this bill to introduce a measure of control <e> <s> it is because of the failure of the local authorities properly so to control <e>", "<cs> the authorities to which the noble lord refers are the bodies that take the political decisions as well as making the analysis if indeed from looking at some of them they make any analysis at all and do not simply rely on political decisions which may be an unworthy but i am not sure is a necessarily unjustified suspicion <e> <s> i am afraid that we cannot get away from the fact that he said to your lordships that this work was being done properly at the moment <e> <s> it is quite clear that the work of analysis must be done now by people not necessarily responsible to the authorities not liable to be told what to do by them but responsible to central government <e> <s> if his concern about the accumulations of staff is real as i am sure it is i would suggest that the sensible thing would be to reduce those staffs at local level <e> <s> perhaps i might make one general observation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish this sentence <e> <s> unless indeed local authorities make reductions in their staffs overall the burden of the rates will be very excessive indeed <e> <s> if the noble lord lord tordoff is becoming excited i will gladly give way to him <e>", "<cs> i did not use the word demolish even on a liberal interpretation of what i said that word cannot be intruded <e> <s> but what i would say and certainly in reply to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is that i see no reason for transport staffs to be in the greater london council at all <e> <s> i would far rather that as under the system which i administered many years ago london transport was answerable directly to the department of transport thereby obviating and i hope that i carry the noble lord lord mcintosh with me any

lord allow me again <e> <s> he is always courteous <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord if he is chiding me with not putting down an amendment to remove london from this bill and i doubt whether it would be within the scope of the bill that if he would be good enough to read the report of the second reading he would see that on second reading i devoted at least a third of my speech to expressing my great disappointment that my noble friend had not included the removal of london transport from the greater london council <e> <s> i thought that i got a not wholly unsympathetic reply from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> it is outside the scope <e>", "<cs> well move it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must not tempt me because he knows i always yield to temptation <e> <s> as oscar wilde put it i can resist anything except temptation <e> <s> my argument was directed to greater london <e> <s> i have made no argument on the point of the provincial authorities although i am quite happy to be persuaded by the noble lord and i think he is rather having that effect on me that we should go further <e> <s> my advocacy however at the moment relates to london <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has tempted me because he has misrepresented me <e> <s> i answered a question from one of his noble friends explicitly to say that i favour taking away transport from the greater london council <e> <s> i very much hope that my noble friend and the government in due course will take action to do that <e> <s> precise methods of doing it are a matter of judgment and tactics <e> <s> i expressly said that i did not include in that hope the other metropolitan authorities <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at <e>", "<cs> if i may invite the committee to return to the narrow question of the amendment itself i can only urge upon my noble friend lord bellwin that if he were to accept this amendment he will be creating a loophole in the provisions of the bill <e> <s> how big or how small that loophole will be in practice is a matter on which there can no doubt be legitimate argument but it would be a loosening of the controls on expenditure rate-borne expenditure by way of subsidy which the bill proposes <e> <s> for that reason i must confess that i look upon it with a measure of suspicion <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what the proposition of the noble lord lord mishcon is but i do say that the secretary of state in assessing the likely expenditure under any scheme should approach the matter with the detached scepticism and cynical clarity of view which one would expect of a minister in this present distinguished administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i have long been an admirer of the mental agility of the noble lord lord mayhew both in another place and in this house but your lordships have been treated this afternoon to a supreme example of it <e> <s> the noble lord has introduced into a debate on the boundary commissions report and the subsequent order the wholly irrelevant if highly entertaining subject of proportional representation <e> <s> i am not going to be seduced by the noble lord into following him up that primrose path although i am one of those of your lordships who are not wholly without views of a somewhat critical character on the various nostrums of pr which are being sold about the country today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in my hand as it happens an extract from dr edmund marshall when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords my ability to paraphrase is not unlimited but as i know perfectly well the noble lord lord underhill has the text in front of him he can check it <e> <s> dr marshall to whose speech i was challenged to refer made it perfectly clear that it was the desire of the labour party to delay the implementation of these measures for as long as possible so as to create as many difficulties as they could for the prime minister in the choice of an election date <e> <s> if the noble lord lord underhill desires to challenge that paraphrase i will take him outside and show him the text <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that somewhat cryptic reply may i ask him whether he and the department are aware of the fact that the employment of young persons is made much more difficult by wages councils orders <e>

corner because of the lights <e> <s> is his indication that the greater london council intend to put in more lights an indication that they are not satisfied with the damage they have done and that they want to make it worse <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the damage being done and the waste of time caused by this scheme can my noble friend at least tell us when this so-called experiment will be deemed to have had enough time so that we shall be able to get back to reasonable traffic movement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is complete agreement on both sides of the house that we want this secretary of state and whenever there is one his successor to act reasonably <e> <s> the point however which the amendment makes is who is to deal with the question if it is alleged that the secretary of state has not acted reasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i can answer his question very simply <e> <s> an executive which believed this to be so could go straight to its local member of parliament or to a member of this house with whom it was in contact <e> <s> the noble lord knows enough about the procedure of this place and i know enough perhaps about the procedure

the noble lord lord kilmarnock speaks was responsible as a result of her attack on the grammar schools for the opening of more independent schools than anybody in british history since his late majesty king henry vi <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a little ungenerous of the noble lord lord mcintosh to complain of the similarity or as i would prefer to put it the consistency of my noble friends speeches <e> <s> if noble lords opposite exercise their right even on third reading to go on putting down substantially the same amendment they really must not be surprised if they get

occasions consistent and sensible answers must also be more or less the same <e> <s> surely the noble lord can absorb that proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house appreciated the generous and proper tribute that the noble lord lord underhill paid to my noble friend lord lucas on his maiden trip in charge of a substantial bill <e> <s> i am sure from this side of the house

underhill himself has shown <e> <s> those of us who have been on front benches both in government and opposition know the handicap that the noble lord lord underhill is under in not having those wise counsellors who send in little bits of paper when the position might otherwise become a little difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord was good enough to listen when i was speaking but i invited the attention of your lordships to the fact that in the present parliament alone her majestys government have suffered defeats a number of them on major issues <e>", "<cs> my

to follow my observations with the courteous attention that i am sure he normally gives them he would have seen that i was quoting hereditary dockers as an example of the fact that at all levels of

takes steps to increase its powers is utterly inconsistent <e> <s> the noble baroness knows that as well as i do <e>", "<cs> i shall always respect the noble baronesss confidences indeed i shall always be flattered to receive them <e> <s> but i would hope that a certain amount of publicity might be given to this rather odd way of announcing a major reversal in the policy of her majestys opposition <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord has understood the amendment <e> <s> the proposal of the amendment is that a power which the bill proposes should be vested solely in the house of commons should also be vested in this place <e> <s> if the noble lord cannot see that that will have the effect of increasing the powers of this place then it is very difficult to explain anything to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and for his forecast of the mid-s <e> <s>

conclusive as regards amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however my noble friend did not deal with nor does his argument i believe apply to amendment no <e> <s> consultation with industry and commerce <e>

and commerce is somewhat different <e>", "<cs> it was reassuring to hear the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey expressing sympathy for the london ratepayer <e> <s> when one remembers that he led his party to victory at county hall at the last election and when one recalls what were the consequences for the london ratepayer this is indeed a daniel come to judgment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wants an answer to that self-evident question that is not the point i was making at all <e> <s> the point i was making was that london transport was of concern to a very large number of people who are not london ratepayers or more significantly london voters and therefore there is a bigger national interest than in the case of any other local authority area that that transport is not mishandled by people who are not answerable to a great many of those who suffer from that mishandling <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to point out the fallacy of that argument <e> <s> the bill proposes to reduce the proportion paid for by the london ratepayer substantially below the proportion which has been exacted from him by the noble lords friends at county hall <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> speaking as an ex-treasury minister which apparently was regarded yesterday as a term of abuse i can think of no better repository for public funds than her majestys devoted and

undertaking to cease using military force in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what is the authority for the extension of the scope of vat referred to in this question <e> <s>

statement is enormously encouraging particularly for the realism which it shows on the part of both the management of british leyland and of her majestys government <e> <s> is my noble friend aware

privately-owned company would have to act in a similar situation <e> <s> is he also aware that in these developments particularly the well-earned success of that magnificent car the new jaguar many of

noble friend will not accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is designed as i understand it to exclude from the financial controls now somewhat belatedly being imposed local authority expenditure in respect of travel concessions <e> <s> we all know the case for travel concessions and that it is a very strong one but i cannot believe that even the noble lord lord tordoff thinks that this is in

what about meals on wheels <e> <s> what about facilities for old people <e> <s> local authorities deal with people unhappily far too helpless even to use public transport <e> <s> those services one might think in human terms have really a far more compelling appeal than travel concessions <e> <s> therefore this is really an attempt to use this bill as a means of knocking out the general control over local authority expenditure which under other measures the government are putting forward <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend has spotted this and i hope that he will knock it on the head <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is asking me that question i am only too happy to respond to it <e> <s> what i am saying is that any responsible local authority will anyhow inside its total expenditure

defenders and supporters of local government <e> <s> it is the clear implication of all these amendments that a local authority if it is ratecapped will immediately concentrate the reduction of its expenditure on these particularly worthwhile areas <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> if the noble lords concern stems from a deep concern about law and order is he saying that

nuclear weapons at the moment and shows no signs whatever of negotiating to reduce that lead <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether consideration has been given to the legal responsibility of those who organise very large gatherings outside premises that are not their normal place of work and which bear no resemblance whatever to the peaceful picketing that our law recognises <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation industry as well as your lordships house is very much indebted to my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for both introducing the subject of this motion and if he will allow me to remark the most admirable speech with which he did so <e> <s> one of your lordships i am not sure whether it was not my noble friend observed that the timing was odd <e> <s> i think that the timing is just right <e> <s> it is one of the strong merits of your lordships house that on any subject one can think of <e> <s> it is able to stage a debate in which there take part members of the house who have very great practical experience of the subject under discussion <e> <s> it is particularly useful therefore that your lordships should debate subjects including this one not so much at a time when government policy has been formed and formulated but at a time when it is in course of formation <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is passing from specific points i wonder whether he is able to say a word on the point that i put to him about the possibility of reviving the decision which was not implemented of a previous government to transfer all british and foreign services to the iberian peninsular to gatwick <e>", "<cs> i think it was fortunate that the right reverend prelate decided to come to this committee to deal with the metropolitan county councils rather than go to the somewhat similarly-named establishment in st marylebone <e> <s> i would not be so ungenerous as to suggest that the fact that it is raining had anything to do with his decision <e> <s> this house always listens to the right reverend prelate with great attention <e> <s> if he will allow me to say so many of us listen with great admiration to the battle which he puts up continually for the interests of the people in his widespread and far from happy diocese <e> <s> i am sure that his admirable speech added very much to the tone of our debate <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would allow me i would point out that he has challenged what i said in this respect <e> <s> of course he is right in saying that the amendments main effect would be to cause very considerable delay and result in a long period during which the government in london would be left in expensive confusion with thereby much damage being done to the governments proposals for a more economical and efficient system <e> <s> there are occasions and this is one of them when delay can be exceedingly damaging and i stick to the word wrecking <e>", "<cs> oh it is <e>", "<cs> i used the word farce deliberately because unlike the noble lord i am quite clear that if these elections were to take place those elected would serve for no more than months <e> <s> i would have thought that the noble lord as one who believes in democratic government would think that to go through the process of elections with a policy and proposals put to the electors knowing that the chopper comes down in months is a situation to which i could apply a stronger word than farce but that would not be parliamentary <e>", "<cs> my point is simple and valid <e> <s> we have embarked on these amendments we are in the course of debating them <e> <s> it would be quite unusual to break off now <e> <s> my noble friend the minister has suggested what seems to be a reasonable course that we should accept these amendments <e> <s> the bill in any event will have to be looked at during later stages and in another place in view of what happened earlier this evening <e> <s> it would in my view be very much improved if the noble earls amendment goes in <e> <s> i would suggest with respect that whether or not we adjourn when this has been dealt with we at least finish work we have started on these particular amendments <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why we should break off at this stage <e>", "<cs> if the amendment is put into the bill and i hope that the noble earl will press for it to be put in that does not exclude the opportunity to look at it again at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> there will be a report stage and there will be a third reading and if the noble baroness thinks it necessary to look at it again there will be ample opportunity <e> <s> indeed it will be somewhat easier to do if it is already in the bill <e> <s> i therefore express the hope that the noble earl will put in what everyone on the merits with one or two exceptions over there regards as a sensible improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord asks that question i would not be in favour of taking it out <e> <s> i think only people with rather limited understanding would want to take it out but there might be people of limited understanding in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord evans of claughton would explain what his amendment means <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord opposite has fully appreciated the effect of his amendment <e> <s> as i read it if subsection is taken out it would be free to every local authority concerned to choose completely freely its own representatives from the new central body <e> <s> there would therefore be nothing to prevent any council with a small majority of one party or another confining its representation to representatives from that party <e> <s> as in the case about which the noble lord is complaining that of the glc the majority of the boroughs have a conservative representation the effect of that would be a much larger conservative representation on the new authority than there would be under this clause <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that the noble lord has misapprehended the effect of his own amendment and it also makes even more unjustifiable the phrase which personally i very much resented though i am sure it was used lightheartedly that this was a gerrymandering clause <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not expect me necessarily to respect the utterances of one or two of those gentlemen <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given away the whole case for his amendment <e> <s> he admits that the effect of the subsection is to his point of view better than leaving it to the councils yet he proposes to delete the subsection <e> <s> he really has made a nonsense of his own amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend examines amendments nos <e> <s> and and if he discovers as he has suggested he might discover that the powers of the police would be increased as a result of the adoption of those amendments may i express the hope that he will adopt them <e>", "<cs> the amendment may well have considerable relevance in respect of road blocks set up in urban areas <e> <s> but as i listened to the noble lord i was inclined to think that he was overlooking the kind of situation which has frequently arisen in the past few years in the remoter country districts <e> <s> the noble lord and your lordships will recall that there have been several cases recently of dangerous and desperate men murderers kidnappers and the like who have taken to the woods and who have been hunted over considerable areas of country for periods longer than hours <e> <s> we should be unnecessarily handicapping those who have to deal with this very difficult situation if we were to restrict the period of the road blocks in those cases to hours albeit that there is as has been pointed out the power to renew <e> <s> the power to renew is there and it is a good thing but it seems unnecessarily bureacratic <e>", "<cs> i should be very grateful if the noble lord opposite would explain how the figure of the number of vehicles is necessarily to be arrived at as a matter of practicality <e> <s> if you put a road block on a road that carries major traffic very soon a very considerable accumulation of traffic builds up <e> <s> equally once this is known a number of vehicles that have been stopped there for a little time either turn round if they can back away or in one way or another escape on to a side road <e> <s> how police manning a road block when there is a large accumulation of vehicles held up by that road block are to provide the figure that the noble lord suggests they should provide seems to me to be very difficult <e> <s> frankly it seems to be a case of think of a number <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment does not of course say anything about an approximate calculation it asks the police to provide the number of vehicles <e> <s> we rightly expect of the police when they are under a statutory obligation to supply material to supply accurate material <e> <s> with respect to say oh well that is not really what i mean they can think of a number does not seem to me to justify this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend the minister about the words in the clause at the point at which it is proposed to add the amendment <e> <s> it appears to limit the power of the constable to stop and search to cases where a vehicle leaves by a designated exit <e> <s> if a vehicle were to leave other than by a designated exit by a back door by pushing down a fence or by some other irregular means of egress surely there would be a still stronger argument for stopping and searching because it would seem <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will take her explanation a little further <e> <s> as i understand it if the vehicle which is suspect is coming out by the back door to use a colloquialism my noble friends argument is that the powers under clause arise <e> <s> clause deals with the exercise of powers by ordinary police constables whereas the clause we are discussing provides powers for the constables employed by the <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will reconsider whether the words by a designated exit are necessary and if they are not will consider removing them at a later stage <e> <s> with reference to my noble friends comment about clause in that clause one is concerned with an ordinary policeman and not with a constable employed by a statutory undertaker <e> <s> with respect my noble friend has not answered my point <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend then explain why the words by a designated exit are in the bill <e> <s> if she is right on that point then that is wholly unnecessary verbiage <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the construction of this enormous complex on the edge of one of the loveliest towns in this country and one of our most valuable tourist attractions is a matter of national not merely local importance <e> <s> will he give an undertaking that the local planning authority will in no circumstances be given permission to go ahead until there has been an opportunity for the matter to be discussed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if his right honourable friend were to give permission to proceed before a debate in parliament took place he might as a result of that debate find himself in some difficulty <e>", "<cs> please sit down <e>", "<cs> i want to say only a few words not as an intervention in the noble lords speech but simply by way of comment <e> <s> if in the face of the threats that have been uttered particularly let us say by the leaders of the glc the government did not introduce as a precaution a clause of this kind or two subsections of this kind in my view they would be guilty of the grossest negligence <e> <s> these threats have been uttered <e> <s> if they were applied and if no powers had been taken local government could be paralysed <e> <s> i think the government would be very much at fault if they did not take this step <e>", "<cs> the committee is dealing with the revised rather than the orthodox version of the text <e> <s> when i saw this amendment on the marshalled list i thought that the noble baroness was indulging in a joke <e> <s> that seemed to be the only rational explanation for this quite extraordinary proposal <e> <s> the amendment states again perhaps it was in another version that publication has to take place <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness need not have troubled herself to intervene <e> <s> that is obvious from the reading of the amendment <e> <s> the only purpose in going ahead with this measure is to clear the way and make preparations for the next bill <e> <s> if it is suggested that these responses are such that the government should suddenly as it were look a little faint and say we have got it wrong and drop <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that moderately encouraging reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the public are deeply disturbed at the deterioration in service in recent months and are not prepared to accept mere declarations of intention <e> <s> if these declarations do not bear fruit may i ask what the government propose to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of my noble friends reply to my noble friend lord nugent and to the noble baroness opposite can he explain other than by suggesting that it is an indication of a lack of drive on the part of the management of the post office why there has been since postal codes were announced this enormous delay in bringing them into operation <e> <s> it has taken many years <e>", "<cs> a point has been made but the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has not answered it <e> <s> surely amendment no <e> <s> does the opposite of what he intends <e> <s> surely what he intends is that the premises shall be left no more vulnerable <e> <s> to provide for a statutory duty to leave them no less vulnerable seems a rather brutal treatment of the occupier <e> <s> it may be that i have misunderstood a possible welsh interpretation <e>", "<cs> with great respect the noble lords amendment does not effect that <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that a -day period could be wholly unreasonable in certain circumstances <e> <s> what the amendment would require within that period is a recording of what has been seized involving as i read it a description of every document that has been seized <e> <s> suppose there was an enormous fraud case of which alas we have had one or two examples in recent years <e> <s> i myself have seen packing case after packing case loaded with documents <e> <s> although it is perfectly true to say that the amendment would not require people to study them each document would have to be looked at individually to be listed and in my view at least that would impose a quite intolerable burden on the police <e> <s> i can see no reason whatever for imposing this time limit and i hope my noble friend will resist it <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord there is all the difference in the world between the handling of documents for discovery in a solicitors office when one is proceeding in an orderly and lawful way to the hearing of a case and dealing with documents which have just been seized in a case of suspected fraud <e> <s> one may find that there are documents in a package the top of which are receipts but it does not follow that the remaining documents are receipts at all <e> <s> they may be totally different <e> <s> indeed anybody who anticipates that he is likely to be facing fraud proceedings and police action for fraud may very well leave his documents in a state of deliberate confusion quite apart from the state of confusion in which some people leave their documents anyway <e> <s> it is no conceivable answer to say that when one is preparing for trial in a solicitors office and one has a bundle of receipts one just counts those receipts <e> <s> in this case one would have to look at each document and look at it closely to see whether it was a receipt or something else <e>", "<cs> is the argument of the noble lord lord gifford therefore that the tourist who commits say a serious offence should get away scot-free <e>", "<cs> disregarding for a moment the degree of seriousness of the offence and i agree that the more serious offences are covered there are some offences which some of us might think were reprehensible <e> <s> the noble lord should face up to this <e> <s> if he presses his amendment he is proposing in the case of the other sort of offences to give complete immunity to a tourist simply because he is a tourist <e> <s> i am very much against that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear from the pattern of these restrictions which i understand have recently been tightened up that they are being operated with the deliberate view of doing as much damage as possible to the economy including the tourist trade of gibraltar <e> <s> in those circumstances will my noble friend make it clear to the spanish government that this is not behaviour which is compatible with ordinary decent relations between european countries quite apart from any question of spains accession to the community <e>", "<cs> surely there is one circumstance at least which will occur to the committee in which the subsection is necessary <e> <s> when a notorious crime is committed or an escape takes place a description of the person sought is broadcast <e> <s> it is always possible that a police officer may he mistaken in identification and arrest someone in the belief that he is the fugitive <e> <s> if five minutes later the police officer hears on his radio that the person concerned has been apprehended he will obviously realise at once that he has made a mistake and he ought therefore immediately to release the person whom he has arrested <e> <s> in those circumstances to insist that the person arrested be dragged to a police station perhaps some distance away and then solemnly taken before a senior officer would surely not only waste everybodys time but could be derogatory to the person concerned <e> <s> that person will have been seen to be under arrest for a longer period he will have been seen possibly by acquaintances being taken into a police station with all the embarrassing awkwardness that that causes <e> <s> in those circumstances to insist that because an arrest has been made the whole procedure must be gone though seems grossly unfair to the arrested person and a waste of everybody elses time <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us whether any explanation or perhaps apology has been offered by the nigerian government for the detention of the british caledonian aircraft and its passengers <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend a question which unusually in this chamber is a genuine request for information and not a technique of dialectic <e> <s> if a person who has been searched has a complaint that perhaps an article has been stolen or mislaid and he desires to take civil proceedings against the police officer concerned would his position in law be different if failure to keep a record was merely i use the word merely deliberately a breach of the code of practice rather than a breach of the statute <e>", "<cs> let the minister answer <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has misunderstood <e> <s> it need not necessarily be a theft but merely through neglect in regard to a large number of articles that one item is lost <e> <s> if the article is lost the person concerned sues the police constable for presumably some form of negligence in dealing with his property <e>", "<cs> it is a slightly comic list nonetheless that the noble and learned lord has produced presumably in the interests of decency <e> <s> if his jacket can he removed why not his hat <e> <s> why not his boots <e> <s> gumboots or a scarf are very often used for storing articles such as drugs

him with the years <e> <s> he should know from long experience that i have a profound respect for his views <e> <s> that is why i was so intrigued to know why he had forgotten his hat <e>", "<cs> we are on an important point i agree entirely with the noble lord lord foot about that but it is a narrow one <e> <s> it is the point as to whether the provision of warning as to the right of silence which it is generally agreed should be given should be embodied in the code of practice or in the statute <e> <s> that is the point as i understand it that your lordships have been discussing for some time now <e> <s> it would help me in making up my mind if we could follow the procedure that my noble friend lord elton will remember we followed somewhat unconventionally on an earlier amendment where a similar point arose though on a less important issue <e> <s> on that occasion as my noble friend will remember i raised the question genuinely seeking information as to whether if the provision in respect of making a list of property found on an accused were embodied only in the code of practice and not in the statute it would make any legal difference to subsequent proceedings

modification of the rigidity of road service licensing <e> <s> is he aware that to many of us the statement made today is not only of the greatest importance but is the culmination of efforts made over many years to relax the elaborate and bureaucratic controls upon bus transport which have had so much to do with both its cost and its inadequacy <e>", "<cs> with due respect i do not think that the noble lord lord mccarthy can get away with the age-old argument that because there have been only a limited number of complaints in <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that the noble lord lord

believer the referendum should be taken before the moment of decision and before the legislation is introduced not after and therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord wants to intervene again i will happily sit down but if he speaks from a semi-sedentary position he is a little more difficult to follow <e> <s> i take it the noble lord is quite happy to accept that what is essential if you believe in referenda is to have them taken at the right time when they can influence decisions <e> <s> if they are taken at a time when it is too late to influence decisions they probably annoy the people who have taken part in them quite a bit when they see how futile their particular manifestation of opinion has been <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has made a personal reference to me may i say that the point i was trying to make which i hope i made clearly and which i shall try to do again now is that when you stand for elective office you must put forward the policies which you will implement if elected <e> <s> i was making the perhaps fairly obvious point that if you are going to be elected only for say months there will be very few policies which you can honestly and sincerely put forward <e> <s> that is not disdainful that is realistic <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> to which i believe the noble lord lord evans said he wished to speak seem to me to be simply an attempt to involve the audit commission and a wholly undescribed committee of inquiry in amendment no <e> <s> in the processes of consideration of the forthcoming abolition bill <e> <s> this is an odd procedure <e> <s> to talk as amendment no <e> <s> does simply of a committee of inquiry without indicating its character quality and function seems to be quite extraordinary <e> <s> but what strikes me even more about it is how derogatory this proposal is to the parliamentary process <e> <s> if the government are introducing complicated legislation of this kind with obviously substantial financial issues involved then it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i have rarely met such a perversion of my argument <e> <s> the point that i was making was that when the bill in this case the abolition bill is before parliament it will be the function and the duty of both houses of parliament to get from the government the financial consequences and to press them for all available details at that stage <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl for having interrupted him from a sitting position <e> <s> i can only explain that i was surprised that so normally reasonable a member of this house as the noble earl committed himself to so outrageous an observation as that which he made about the attitude of the voluntary bodies <e> <s> the respectable voluntary bodies and not all voluntary bodies are respectable have far more confidence in my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will allow me i would say that i have so large a list that i pride myself on producing a different group on each occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords following that very disappointing reply may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware of the fact that in matters of this particular kind raising national issues in respect of a place of national importance parliament also has a right to be consulted before rather than after the decision has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend appreciate from the questions that have been put to him the very widespread concern there is about this proposal and its impact on stratford <e> <s> does he also appreciate that while everybody wants to ensure that the bbc gets a good and a technically efficient site for its most important transmissions this proposal raises such serious public issues that it is quite wrong to exclude parliament until a decision has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the suggestion contained in the question of the noble lord lord molloy would be utterly futile inasmuch as the continuance of this strike has been declared by the leadership of the miners union to have political aims including the destruction of the government <e> <s> therefore is it not for the miners themselves to take a hand and stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> arising out of the last answer of my noble friend is she aware that the argentine governments direct and clear repudiation of a recently made agreement cannot fail to be noted by those from whom argentina is trying now to borrow money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am less clear than i should be and i think some of your lordships may be too as to which amendments we are speaking to at the moment <e> <s> as i understood it the noble baroness moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i did not hear her make any reference to any other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble baroness since there are on the marshalled list a number of amendments which have some connection with this issue <e> <s> it is clear from my intervention that we are taking also amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness would allow me to say so she does not seem to appreciate fully the anxiety which exists among the ratepayers in the metropolitan areas as to what these authorities may do by way of financial activity during the further year which as a result of the decision of this house they were given <e> <s> there is very deep anxiety among ratepayers <e> <s> in those circumstances even if delay results to perfectly respectable projects it seems to me essential for the government to obtain proper control of local authority spending over that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make just one observation on the second part of the amendment <e> <s> i refer to the extraordinary proposition that the period of disqualification should be limited to st march that is about months from now <e> <s> there may be such deliberate defiance of the law by members of one or other of these authorities that a court left to itself might feel that such a person was unfitted to take part in local government for a great many years <e> <s> that is at least a possibility <e> <s> if the offence brought before the court is more modest then perhaps a fairly short period of disqualification will be imposed <e> <s> but to say in advance that however gross the breaches of the law and however provocative the behaviour of the authority member concerned he should not be disqualified for more than months is simply asking for trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that i had not sat down i should like to say only this in reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> yes the bill is a temporary bill but the offence and this is a point the noble baroness has not dealt with may be so gross that a court and this is a matter for an independent court and not for your lordships may feel that such a person would be grossly unsuited for any local government office for a number of years to come <e> <s> now to say however gross that is that because the penalty arises from a temporary bill he cannot be put out for more than months is to make a fool of the court and a fool of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend very much for the attention she has paid to the representations made at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that very illuminating reply may i ask her whether in practice there is any means of restricting the number of persons entitled to these immunities resident in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend make it equally clear that spanish accession to the community would involve the withdrawal of the restrictions in the use of spanish air space by gibraltar aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fitting that someone from these benches also should pay a short tribute to the noble lord lord shinwell on this historic occasion and that i should try to express the admiration and affection that those of us on these benches hold for the noble lord <e> <s> we admire his capacity for hard-hitting for fighting hard for the causes in which he believes <e> <s> we also feel an affection for one of the most lovable characters in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that no beneficiary has been put in any difficulty as a result of this action <e> <s> if he is not saying that will he not deplore the action of people who in order to pursue their own claims are prepared to impose hardship on the poorest section of our community <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware in the light of the supplementary question put two questions ago from the benches opposite that the people concerned are refusing to carry out the duties they have been asked to carry out and in pursuit of their standpoint are apparently quite prepared to inflict a great deal of hardship on people much poorer than themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply i should like to ask him whether he can confirm that at any rate most of those offences are offences other than traffic offences <e> <s> can he also confirm ones impression that there has been a proliferation in diplomatic staffs in london in particular from the newer countries <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the high-spending record of the current ilea and my <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend clear up a point on gibraltar which he dealt with the other day with less than his usual high standard of clarity <e> <s> do my noble friend and the government accept that it would be inconsistent with membership of the european community for spain to continue to obstruct the use of her airspace to aircraft seeking to use gibraltar airport <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend observed the success in singapore of restraint in population growth by the adroit use by lee kuan yew of the tax system <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend express similar confidence about the libyan presents to the national union of mineworkers <e>", "<cs> my lords the house and i think the civil aviation industry are both indebted not for the first time to the noble baroness for raising this matter on an unstarred question this evening <e> <s> indeed i hope i may be allowed to say from some experience going back over a number of years of the work of the noble baroness that i know of no person who has done more for the airline traveller than the noble baroness going on from her indefatigable work years ago as a member of the airline users committee which i very well remember <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i think it is the fact that the wisdom which he left behind in that respect at any rate remained in the ministry when we came to the moment of decision of and i am sure we were very indebted to him <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene on this point <e> <s> is he really saying that a person who turns up at the airport with a ticket bought in good faith at the lower rate will be told that that ticket is valueless unless he puts up another <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is very good in giving way again <e> <s> i hope that the government will give further thought to this point <e> <s> accepting that it may be the airlines ought not to have sold the tickets they were sold and they were purchased in good faith <e> <s> is it not really very serious indeed to face people who may not have been able to afford any more with the alternative of abandoning their tickets and what they have paid or paying more than they may be able to afford <e> <s> cannot the government give further thought to this and would even the american system cause any trouble if they were allowed to travel on the earlier fare even if other people are not allowed later on <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said that his right honourable friend is considering how to implement the limit <e> <s> does that mean that he has rejected entirely the proposal to increase it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the agreeable aspects of our procedure that we begin the session on a motion for an address to the sovereign thanking her for the gracious speech with which she opened it <e> <s> it is agreeable because it reminds us of how lucky we are in this country in our institutions in our monarchy and in the occupant of the throne and this particularly at a time when some people like the noble lord lord mishcon are talking of divisions is in fact a very unifying factor <e>", "<cs> my lords if he did mention it i apologise to him <e> <s> however the noble lords emphasis was on the glc as i confess will be mine <e> <s> i know that views are very strongly held both ways on this matter but surely it is essential that we should get on with it quickly <e> <s> until it is settled until the bill is through and in operation there will be a great deal of confusion as regards government in london and a great deal of extravagance and waste of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord would not wish to misrepresent me he is too courteous <e> <s> the passage in my speech about length of sentence as i think the noble lord will find when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the fact that the best way to help the building industry at the moment would be to persuade local planning authorities to expedite their decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us will welcome the fact that somewhat belatedly after an interval of four and a half years restrictions whose withdrawal was promised then and which should never have been imposed are now being withdrawn <e> <s> is she also aware that some of us are a little concerned that the subject of the sovereignty of what has after all been british territory for years should be thought worthy of discussion <e> <s> will my noble friend make it plain quite apart from her very clear statement with reference to the constitution that her majestys government have no sympathy with the demand by the spanish government to acquire territory which has been british longer than it was ever spanish <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that notwithstanding the febrile if predictable rhetoric of the noble lord lord bruce many people will feel that greater selectivity in the use of the regional grant is to be welcomed <e> <s> is he particularly aware that its extension to the service industries seems to make very good sense in view of the much better outlook for the service industries as compared with manufacturing industry today <e> <s> can he say in particular whether that extension takes it into the field of tourism and hotels <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we are <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that one of the best ways of helping the tourist business in gibraltar would be to improve the airport in particular by lengthening the runway and that her majestys governments intervention will be required for that not only for financial reasons but also to clear with spain the consequential use of spanish air space <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that many people will resent being taxed in order to enable a person who is deliberately abstaining from work to continue to purchase a house <e> <s> is he also aware that that stands in sharp contrast with the fact that the man who is working does not get such assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of a previous question from the benches opposite is this not a case not of a miner being threatened with the loss of his house but of his being enabled by the taxpayer to be relieved of what would otherwise be a debt which he would have to pay to the building society at the end of the strike <e>", "<cs> my lords as several noble lords have observed this has been a remarkable and a memorable debate <e> <s> it has also been yet another example of the fact that in this house on almost any subject you care to choose we are able to find members who speak with the authority of long practical experience <e> <s> the contributions which we have had to this debate and to the discussion of this problem particularly from those distinguished former heads of the civil service have been i have found of remarkable interest and value <e> <s> until we reached the winding-up speeches it was a debate too which was wholly free and i have sat through it all of any party acrimony at all <e> <s> in regard to my noble friends reference to the noble lord lord ennals jazzing-up the debate i should only remind both noble lords that jazz is now very much out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that under ilo regulations next year is the year of decision for the government as to the continuation or otherwise of these bodies <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that many people in this country feel that in the present employment situation it is absurd to prevent a man accepting a job at a wage that he is prepared to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend gives that consideration will he also bear in mind that a measure which will help to provide more employment particularly for young people is absurdly described and passes the credibility barrier if described as an attack on the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the comparatively small proportion of the cost out of the total defence budget contribute on the other hand a major factor for maintaining the peace of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not also reasonable to take into account the very heavy burden of public investment which the government anyhow undertake particularly in respect of the nationalised industries including the coal industry <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the question of legislation will my noble friend and the government bear in mind that legislation to do what is asked for in this question would not be likely to be controversial and therefore would be very unlikely to take much parliamentary time <e> <s> will he not represent to his colleagues the point that this is a good thing which ought to be done promptly <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the doubts now being expressed about the united states dollar in the light in particular of the american governments massive borrowing requirement is it not likely that the pressure on sterling which has occasioned this action by the government will be of short duration <e> <s> are we not entitled to hope that a return to lower interest rates and a stronger pound is a very likely possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the announcement of a further step towards privatisation particularly in the light of the great success of this company when predominantly privatised as was so helpfully brought out by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe i should like to ask my noble friend a little more about the blocking mechanism or the golden share <e> <s> is that a power which can be exercised only in the event of a proposal either to turn the company into a foreign held company or to alter the articles in that respect or is it a power which in the discretion of the government <e> <s> can be exercised in any circumstances <e> <s> i should be very grateful if my noble friend would describe the details of the power <e> <s> is it a share with voting rights equivalent to all the other shares or is it some specially restricted blocking mechanism related only to proposals to amend the articles <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that argentina indulged in an act of military aggression against british territory and british ships can my noble friend say whether she is now making any suggestion of the payment of compensation or reparations as has normally been the case with similar episodes in history <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now my very pleasant duty on behalf of your lordships to congratulate the noble lord lord monkswell on the extremely impressive and moving maiden speech which he has made to us <e> <s> from this side of the house it is particularly agreeable to see that the noble lord came to address us this afternoon within hours of joining us <e> <s> it is reassuring to see so obviously loyal a member of the labour party feeling so great a concern and interest in this house <e> <s> we all find it very reassuring <e> <s> as regards what the noble lord said about the personal tragedy of unemployment i think he expressed what certainly i feel and what i think most of us feel the humiliation the feeling of being unwanted which given the present standard of social services is in fact far the worst aspect of this curse <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right he referred to the international recession but he used the phrase that unemployment was caused by the policy of the government <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord does not do so then his intervention was wholly pointless and a waste of time <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems absolutely plain <e> <s> it seems plain that the noble lords intervention was wholly pointless <e> <s> he made the remark which i attributed to him and which i shall confirm in <e>", "<cs> much more my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> my noble friend left the chamber and said he was returning <e> <s> no doubt once he sees the noble lords name on the annunciator he will hasten back <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must not misrepresent me <e> <s> i did not say that we should not follow a policy for unity <e> <s> i said that we should follow the right policy and then try and unify the country behind that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the delays that have taken place in the delivery of previous ships can my noble friend say whether the tauter contract terms to which he referred include stiff penalties for failure to deliver to date <e> <s> secondly can he tell the house what was the saving forgone in my view rightly by placing the orders for the two type ships in different yards <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in asking one simple question i hope i shall not be charged by the noble lord lord bruce of donington with arrogant brevity <e> <s> at least one element of that charge cannot be attributed to the noble lord lord bruce of donington himself <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that many people will consider that this announcement is particularly well timed as first an indication of the governments concern to preserve and develop the economically immensely important never more important activities of the city of london and secondly as an encouragement to the hundreds of thousands of people who will it is hoped become shareholders in public companies for the first time and who will require rather more guidance through the complexities of investment than did the smaller number of more sophisticated investors in the past <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment as the noble lord said and one on the merits of which i am bound to say that i have some sympathy with him <e> <s> i am bound to say also that i welcome very much the concern which he has shown which is not always shown from those benches for that persecuted class of humanity the directors of public companies <e> <s> but i rise really to question the procedure <e>", "<cs> i am particularly obliged to the noble lord because that indicates that the width of his benevolence and human sympathy is even wider than appeared at first sight and that is a very agreeable element to introduce into this discussion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord repeats again and again his concern for the small man but i wonder whether he and your lordships fully appreciate that he is asking for that small man the consumer to be given preference over what may be other small people the suppliers of goods to the insolvent company <e> <s> it is very easy to feel well disposed towards giving priority to somebody but it is necessaryto recall that if one does one is pushing somebody else further down the ladder <e> <s> there is no reason to assume that the consumer in this case is any smaller a man than the supplier of goods <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not go along the road <e>", "<cs> in some cases he certainly has but in others he has not <e> <s> the really small supplier of goods may be a member of a trade association and have the advantage of that but he may not <e> <s> but what i was protesting against and do protest against is the idea of giving an absolute priority when one of these unfortunate things happens to one creditor rather than to another <e>", "<cs> with great respect it does not arise on this amendment and i am therefore not saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the green paper will contain any proposals for improving the manners of certain senior academics <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington about his understanding of how subsection of this proposed clause would operate <e> <s> as he knows the attorney-general in many matters acts wholly independently of the government and government colleagues and on his own judgment independent of political pressures <e> <s> on the other hand we are here involved as has just been pointed out in the possibility of quite substantial public expenditure <e> <s> does the noble lord envisage that if this clause was put into the law the attorney-general would be free to hand out this public money on his own unfettered judgment or whether like other spending ministers he would have to seek in advance the consent of the treasury <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> it follows does it not <e> <s> that the treasury would have no say in decisions as to whether a particular case should be financed out of public funds <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend clarify one point in her most interesting and welcome statement <e> <s> does the reopening of the land frontier with spain also include the right to operate seaborne services across the bay between gibraltar and algeciras such as used to exist <e> <s> secondly and on a different point in the course of her right honourable and learned friends discussions with sr moran was any regret expressed on behalf of spain for the damage done over years by this wrongful act both to gibraltar and to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i find i can agree and it is a pleasant experience with at least one thing that the noble lord lord mishcon said in his speech <e> <s> it is that not only the house but also the country owes a great deal to my noble friend lord renton for raising this immensely important subject this afternoon <e> <s> i add also that as some of us know my noble friends concern with civil defence goes back many years <e> <s> he did tremendous work when he was a home office minister in trying to get that not always dynamic department i hope my noble friend will not mind my saying that a little more active in these matters <e> <s> over the years he has done much good work in drawing public attention to the needs of this very important topic <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the most beautiful crossword but it does not get the noble lord off the hook <e> <s> i have quoted what he said <e> <s> i have tried to the best of my ability to see whether there is any logic in it at all <e> <s> i think that the house on the whole is inclined to take the view that there is not that this is really arrant nonsense <e> <s> the motive that actuates the noble lord in putting this forward is a matter for him <e> <s> but the idea that by stripping this country of any means of mitigating the effect of a nuclear attack we are in some mysterious way discouraging rather than encouraging a possible aggressor who has many of those weapons from using them really seems to pass from the realms of human logic into at least the outskirts of insanity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that that is a travesty of the facts and he knows that the fact that we had just sufficient arms to bring us through to ultimate victory was due to the government of the day still the national government of the day with conservatives and i am happy to say many liberals in it <e> <s> every measure that they put forward to increase the air force and to introduce as i have said compulsory military service only a few months before the outbreak of war was opposed by those who then led the labour party continually opposed <e> <s> if they had had their way we should either not have gone into the war then and been mopped up later on without difficulty by hitler or alternatively we should have gone in and been beaten <e> <s> if the noble lord lord beswick would wait a moment i am dealing with his noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the less that members of the labour party decide to reminisce about their behaviour in the years preceding the war or about anybody elses behaviour the better for them i think <e> <s> does the noble lord lord beswick want to say something <e> <s> no he does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to hear any tribute to the greatest man i ever met and i am proud to say served under even from the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> but the fact remains that mr churchill as he then was rightly pressed the government of the day to go far further in the matter of national defence <e> <s> i am happy and proud to say that my father as a member of another place supported him in that a fact which has given me pride all through <e> <s> the labour party hampered the admittedly less than adequate efforts that the government of that day were making and i am no defender of mr neville chamberlain and his activities <e> <s> i think he made many mistakes <e> <s> but at least he did something to provide us with just enough by way of defence and the labour party did its best to stop him <e>", "<cs> my lords i promised to give way to the noble lord but i am not going to again <e>", "<cs> my lords we have before been through the experience of those who say it is useless to provide for defence <e> <s> those of us who have lived through that before and seen the troubles that it brought on this country do not i

quite irrelevant to this issue <e> <s> something much smaller could go <e> <s> i did actually i thought make a constructive suggestion the insolvency bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the argentine yet accepts that hostilities are now at an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to differ from my country neighbour the noble and learned lord lord denning and from my old friend and

"<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that very interesting and informative reply may i ask him whether that substantial expenditure on behalf of the british taxpayer will be borne in mind

agreement with the noble lord lord wigoder in his concluding words <e> <s> whatever doubts or anxieties any of your lordships may have as to particular provisions of the act it is a very new act to

to me to reveal any serious or severe failures in it <e> <s> therefore whatever your lordships or the government may decide to do in future years it would seem that on this occasion to seek to dismember the act to some extent would be at the very least premature <e> <s> i therefore find myself wholly with the noble lord lord wigoder on that point <e>", "<cs> skill anyhow <e>", "<cs> my

authority takes the view that there will be a shortage of runway capacity in the greater london area as soon as <e> <s> if the government accept that expert view does not that indicate the need for very urgent remedial action given that in civil aviation terms five years is a very short time <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people who have studied this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords there appear to be three points which arise in this debate first the merits of the bill secondly whether or not it is retrospective which is obviously a matter on which opinions can differ and there will no doubt be some argument and thirdly the procedure which the noble lord lord tordoff has seen fit to adopt in putting down what courtesy demands i should describe as a reasoned amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to me <e> <s> if the noble lord has not the guts to give way <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the noble lord has referred to me <e> <s> he has not the guts <e>", "<cs> my lords if as my noble friend indicated the parole board was not aware of the threats that this man had made towards the woman he had previously raped is that not indicative of the danger of interfering with sentences imposed by a trial judge who has heard all the evidence and seen the accused <e> <s> if the noble lord lord hunt is right in saying that per cent <e> <s> of persons paroled commit further crimes is that not further confirmation of the dangers of the procedure being followed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are some of us who wish to thank him not only for repeating the statement but for its contents <e> <s> is he aware that in an area in which possible expenditure is all but unlimited any responsible government have to choose their priorities as governments have done in the past and that it seems to many of us that the present government have got it about right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that last week when answering a question on this point at somewhat greater length he accepted that the parole board had released upon society a man who had threatened to kill the witness against him and who on his release carried out that threat <e> <s> in the circumstances would it not make for the peace of mind of the community and of innocent people outside if in future persons who had uttered such threats were not paroled <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the reliance on the value of supervision of a paroled prisoner which he indicated in his reply to the noble lord lord hunt was apparently not sufficient to prevent this particular paroled prisoner from carrying out his threat of murder <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if supervision is as inefficient as that it will not carry very much confidence particularly among those brave people who have given evidence against a criminal at his trial <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that what the noble lord opposite calls a sickly yellow and a yellow rash could by a less jaundiced eye be seen as a golden glow <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i lack the culinary and many other skills of the noble earl who has just addressed us and i want to put to my noble friend one very simple but it seems to me basic point <e> <s> as he explained to us the purpose of these clamping provisions is to prevent obstruction of our streets <e> <s> all of us of course are with him there <e> <s> obstruction of traffic in the streets of london is not only a matter of intense irritation but also of considerable economic damage <e> <s> but this particular instrument for doing so seems to me to have in it almost entertaining aspects of paradox <e> <s> if the clamping is to be applied as i assume it is only to cars which are obstructing the traffic it is a little difficult to see why a step should be taken which makes it impossible for the owner to move the car and cease to obstruct the traffic <e> <s> the purpose seems to be defeated by the action taken by the authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that if i park my car in a position where it will definitely obstruct traffic i shall be absolutely free from the risk of being clamped <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that moderately reassuring reply may i ask him whether he is aware that first-class mail between points in central london nowadays sometimes takes two or three days for delivery and that the incidence of wrong delivery of clearly-addressed mail is rising <e> <s> if the post office board is incapable of remedying this will the government consider further appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those rather disturbing figures <e> <s> may i ask him whether they would not be smaller if the wise and experienced people who now serve on the parole board actually saw the convicted man before deciding to recommend his release upon the public <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his administrative argument against what would have seemed to many to be the elementary practice of seeing a convicted man before he is released upon the public will not altogether satisfy those members of the public who suffer from the depredations of people unnecessarily released on them nor would it seem to be an adequate answer to those who object to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if we ceased to make new investments in any country whose governments actions we disapproved of our foreign trade would be very restricted indeed in the world of today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend one question arising out of what i know the house realises is an historic statement and one which is of particular appeal to some of us in as much as it brings into the community portugal our oldest ally <e> <s> my question relates to the problem posed by the size larger i understand than that of the whole of the rest of the community put together of the spanish fishing fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house comes to a decision i want to ask my noble friend a question which may affect the way in which some of your lordships will react if the matter is put to a division <e> <s> i hope that i understood my noble friend to be promising without specifying that there would be an amendment or certain amendments put into the bill in another place <e> <s> if such amendment even one is put in your lordships will have a chance to consider it when it comes back to this house <e> <s> however if there were to be no amendment the opportunity for your lordships to consider the matter would not arise <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether my noble friend with the leave of the house would clarify the position <e> <s> it may be due to my imperfection of understanding but i did not understand whether he was saying that there would be consultations and there might be amendments or that there would be consultations which would result in at least one amendment <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will clear up the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble and learned friend has not exhausted his right to reply <e> <s> i rose as quickly as i could to ask him two questions about the new clause <e> <s> first i must confess that having read and re-read subsection i find it extraordinarily difficult to understand <e> <s> it appears to be an exception to the cesser of a disqualification <e> <s> although i am sure that it is pellucidly clear to my noble and learned friend i must confess that my conning of it has not been wholly successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can clear up the question of the inter-relation of the very interesting proposals which he has just announced and the existing provisions for vocational training for young people <e> <s> for example i have in mind the fact that the catering industry already undertakes very substantial training work in respect of young people <e> <s> how will that be slotted into the new scheme <e> <s> how also does the new scheme relate to recruitment by the armed forces of young people the young soldiers type of scheme which also serves a very useful purpose <e> <s> how will all these be brought together <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my noble friends last answer can he say whether those clubs at which disturbances frequently take place and which therefore involve a considerable police effort are made to pay the full cost of that police effort <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether it would not be more in accordance with the sensible practice of this house if noble lords who have doubts about the adequacy of the provision for the national health service were to table a motion for debate <e> <s> they could then put their points and have them answered rather than put down a general question and without notice try to spring a particular example of an alarming nature on a minster who cannot conceivably be expected to give an answer to it

confession and penitence are a good thing indeed i believe that even the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham will accept that and i must therefore begin with a confession <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness has got it wrong on the basis of the anonymous document to which she referred <e> <s> the income of both the glc and of the london boroughs comes from two sources from government grant and from the ratepayers <e> <s> the ratepayers will remain exactly the same except that they will have been relieved of the cost of maintaining the glc <e> <s> therefore they will actually have more funds available <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but i have given way once and there are many people yet to speak <e> <s> i come now to the amendment and i believe it would be a misstatement to call it a reasoned amendment which the noble baroness has put on the order paper <e> <s> the amendment is inherently self-contradictory <e> <s> it makes mention of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has referred to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord dare not <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord lord shackleton that it is for us to discipline ourselves in this matter and that it is not merely for my noble friend the leader of the house to intervene <e> <s> the house itself has a very considerable responsibility <e> <s> in that context there are two points in the report to which i should like very briefly to refer <e> <s> one is the suggestion that read supplementary questions should not be permitted <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will insist on that <e> <s> if a supplementary question is read it is clearly not spontaneous it is clearly prefabricated <e> <s> it seems to me that that spoils the whole spirit of question time <e> <s> i hope that your lordships in exercising the discipline that we can all exercise on each other will be very firm indeed if any noble lord seeks to read a supplementary question <e>", "<cs> i find myself in support of my noble friend on the front bench sadly for once in opposition to my noble friend beside me basically for two reasons <e> <s> the indemnification point which my noble friend the minister has made if one accepts some of the medical views which have been expressed may be of considerable import <e> <s> if the view is sustained that the ingestion of fluoridated water over the years can produce disease and it is held by a good deal of medical opinion then indemnification may be of a very serious financial nature <e>", "<cs> the noble lord almost challenged me to make a second reading speech which as i did not speak on second reading is a temptation to which i might be peculiarly susceptible but i shall resist it <e> <s> however i do not resist the temptation to come back to him on two points <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend for that reminder <e> <s> with regard to the per cent <e> <s> of water that is drunk i suppose that those who could be described as children must be well under per cent <e> <s> and that makes the position even more absurd <e> <s> as my noble friend intervened he will recall because he has raised it the great battle of andover years ago when a very distinguished physician in the country who happened to be my own doctor led the opposition which caused the local authority in andover to obtain an injunction to stop fluoride being introduced <e> <s> your lordships committee might be entertained by the australians splendid comment <e> <s> he asked where is this going to stop <e> <s> if you go on like this it will be enos in the morning and gin at night <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to point out that that is a very unfair comparison <e> <s> it is not a comparison between putting thalidomide into the water and the damage to the national health service i should have said putting fluoride into the water but it is all the same is it not <e> <s> and the cost of dealing with dental caries which nobody underrates <e> <s> it is a question of the choice between putting fluoride into the water of which as we discovered only about per cent <e> <s> actually goes into childrens mouths and administering it direct to children through toothpaste <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has not followed the point <e> <s> as i understand it everybody favours dealing with childrens teeth but not necessarily by putting fluoride in the water <e> <s> it is perfectly possible to administer it by way of toothpaste or pills <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the true compassion for the unemployed is <e>", "<cs> i agreed with the noble baroness lady birk on one point in her speech when she said that this was an unusual request embodied in the amendment <e> <s> indeed it is <e> <s> when a measure has been preceded by a paving bill has itself passed the house of commons by large majorities and has already received a second reading by another large majority in this house it is as she would agree unusual to say at this stage that one wants an inquiry <e> <s> but the noble baroness and to some extent the noble lords lord diamond and lord tordoff showed extreme sensitivity to the suggestion that this was intended as a delaying measure <e> <s> i will not use the pejorative phrase wrecking because wrecking is a subjective impression though i harbour a suspicion that were it to wreck the bill the noble baroness would not go into mourning about it <e>", "<cs> i have only one point that i should like to submit to your lordships committee on this because i have no great general enthusiasm for referenda <e> <s> my point relates specifically to greater london <e> <s> as i understand the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord broadbridge the referendum for greater london would apply only to those who are electors in greater london that is to say in general residents of the greater london area <e> <s> i observed on second reading that greater london is a purely arbitrary division of the south-eastern region and a large proportion of the rates in greater london are paid by people who reside outside it but commute every day to do their work <e> <s> they pay rates on their offices their factories and their general places of work <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would be so courteous as to consult my second reading speech he would see that i am very much with him in that proposal <e> <s> one of the arguments which i adduced for the abolition of the glc was precisely that <e> <s> it levies rates via the precept on a large number of people who do not have votes in its area <e> <s> consistency with respect is said to be a characteristic of little minds but i am wholly consistent in this in supporting the abolition of the glc and in raising the point that a fair referendum for greater london would be possible only if one included the whole of the south-east region <e> <s> it is from the south-east region that those who contribute a large proportion of the rates come <e>", "<cs> in spite of that generous offer i did he may recall express a certain lack of enthusiasm for referenda in general and therefore i do not think that the noble lord will have to over-exert himself in supporting me on that <e>", "<cs> i share the view expressed by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls at the beginning of this debate that it has been a mistake to take together amendments nos <e> <s> and because although the principle involved may be broadly <e>", "<cs> there is nothing inconsistent between that and what i said a moment ago <e> <s> the committee has yet to consider the amendments which the noble baroness has put down <e> <s> it will be her experience that the committee does not automatically or universally accept amendments which she moves <e> <s> sometimes they are rejected <e> <s> what the noble baroness is proposing therefore is to set up a structure and then frankly find things for it to do <e> <s> that surely is the wrong way round <e> <s> the right way if one is to consider this rationally is to identify functions if you can find them which it is essential for a london-wide elected body to perform and then set up the body to discharge them not to set up the body first and then seek to find functions to heap on to it <e>", "<cs> i see that the noble lord lord ennals applauds but that the leader of the opposition who is a wilier bird remains much more sensibly silent <e>", "<cs> i am of course grateful to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i shall follow it up if i may <e> <s> the noble lord said that the charities concerned were not disturbed by the advertisement <e> <s> has he seen the statement made by people who organise several of those charities saying that they were disturbed by it including the statement by mr rix of mencap <e> <s> it is not right or accurate for the noble lord to say that they were not disturbed by that disgraceful advertisement <e>", "<cs> of course but be careful <e>", "<cs> i am of course indebted to my noble friend as i must because of the courtesies of this house describe him for that extraordinarily helpful intervention <e> <s> my noble friend being a logical and fair-minded man will accept that if there is a genuine alarm it does not exactly cause it to be reduced by the body involved in london taking space in the newspapers to tell voluntary organisations in terms that they may not be able to carry on <e> <s> your lordships will not feel that that amounts to reassurance nor that it was intended as such <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was polite about my capacities as a debater but his intervention was a singularly adroit but largely irrelevant piece of debating <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that exceedingly interesting information <e> <s> does it not amount to saying that a sentence of life imprisonment imposed by a court does not now mean that <e> <s> is my noble friend happy about that <e> <s> does it not carry a risk that the deterrent effect of a sentence which is only imposed for very serious offences is being undermined <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend share the view of the noble lord lord mishcon that these important matters should be withheld from parliament and from the public <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm reports that the ussr is still building up its stock of chemical weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of us unlike him were not at all surprised at the predictable reaction of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will not hold it against my noble friend lord onslow if i confess to your lordships that my intervention in this debate is solely the result of his speech <e> <s> my noble friend unwittingly i think touched on a rather curious aspect of this matter <e> <s> he referred in terms which the late sir john betjeman could hardly have bettered or worsened to slough to staines and to the heathrow area <e> <s> but your lordships while not necessarily being <e>", "<cs> with his habitual adroitness the noble lord has neatly sidestepped my noble friend lord onslows point and put it not on heathrow not on slough nor staines but on the areas adjoining where the case is quite different <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend for those observations although if they had already been expressed by the noble lord lord melchett it would appear to be perhaps a trifle superfluous to repeat them <e> <s> if he would consult <e>", "<cs> i do not want to waste the time of the noble baroness although it is always a pleasure to address her <e> <s> but the noble lord quoted as examples of the urban fringe which he deprecated these three specific locations <e> <s> if the noble baroness will contain her impatience until <e>", "<cs> i would suggest to the noble baroness that she should read <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that moderately satisfactory answer <e> <s> may i ask her whether the spanish government particularly remembering that it is the government of a country which is a candidate for the eec have given any explanation of their delay in raising these restrictions <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord ezra takes an unduly pessimistic view of the capacity and efficiency of the boroughs to which under the bill as it stands these functions would be transferred <e> <s> this is after all throughout the country essentially a local government function and i see no reason apparently some noble lords do not agree but of course it is a local government function <e>", "<cs> this is as i said a local government function <e>", "<cs> noble lords say no but it is a function at the moment of the glc which is at the moment a local government authority <e> <s> i do not really see why noble lords make such heavy weather of that <e> <s> it seems to me to be the most elementary of propositions <e> <s> what i was trying to say to the noble lord lord ezra was that his speech no doubt unintentionally carried a real reflection on the efficiency of the boroughs to which under the bill as it stands these functions would pass <e> <s> experience has shown over the years that authorities of this size and in london for example we are talking of authorities of the size and significance of westminster kensington and chelsea and camden have been perfectly capable in handling these matters <e> <s> indeed with the growth of the policy of putting out waste disposal to private contract they have proved themselves extremely flexible in adapting to that situation <e> <s> therefore i start with the proposition that there is no reason whatever to assume that the authorities to which under the bill these functions would be transferred would be other than capable of administering them <e> <s> i must say to the noble lord lord ezra that i think most of the local authorities concerned would very much resent any imputation to the contrary <e>", "<cs> i admire the conservatism of the last part of the noble lords speech particularly as delivered from that bench <e> <s> however i admire rather less his clarity of thinking because having got very excited about waste disposal which he argues is not a local government function he then went on to point out that it was in fact handled by local government authorities which he named <e> <s> therefore we really come back to the question of whether both waste collection and disposal are beyond the capacity of the authorities to which under the bill they would go <e> <s> although i am naturally obliged to the noble lord for indicating that his speech did not convey any reflection on these authorities it seems to me that for this committee to take the view that they could not manage this would be a quite serious reflection on large important responsible and experienced bodies such as these are <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that i should regret it enormously if the noble baroness thought i had been discourteous to her <e> <s> that is the last thing i should wish to be <e> <s> i think however she would agree that the noble lord in possession of the committee can at least select the moment at which he gives way and not subject his grammar to undue strain by giving way in the middle of a sentence <e> <s> i would remind the noble baroness that if she is seeking to lecture me on courtesy i very quickly gave way to her which is very much in contrast with the conduct of her noble leader on the second reading who declined three times to give way to me when he had mentioned me specifically by name <e> <s> so i am not really very inclined to take lessons in manners from the bench opposite <e>", "<cs> the difficulty of the argument which the noble baroness has just addressed to your lordships i think is this <e> <s> if for ilea a system of pr is so superior to that operating elsewhere in our electoral system why stop with ilea <e> <s> is not her argument if it has validity one of much wider application than merely to ilea <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the speech of the noble baroness is wholly relevant to this bill but the issue which she has raised which does not arise necessarily on this bill at all has very much wider implications <e> <s> if one accepts the argument that for ilea a system of pr is very advantageous i think that she will appreciate that it must carry implications into a far wider area <e> <s> that was the point that i was putting to her <e> <s> indeed i suggest to her as i suggest to all your lordships that if it is proposed as my noble friend lord chelwood has proposed to apply to ilea a system of election not applied anywhere else in the british isles outside northern ireland it at least puts the onus of proof on those who propose such a system to show why in the special circumstances of ilea as the noble baroness says that is all we are discussing a system not operating in the rest of the united kingdom should be applied <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says there is no other body like ilea <e> <s> indeed if one felt like being frivolous one might perhaps say that there is something in that point <e> <s> but what is so unusual about it this is the point to which the noble lord must address himself that demands an electoral system which is not in fact provided for any other body in <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i hope he is not suggesting that the unique and unhappy circumstances of northern ireland which i think all the committee profoundly regret have any relevance or application to the inner london education authority <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the right reverend prelate <e> <s> the suggestion which was made by the noble lord lord chelwood that this system would facilitate the representation of ethnic groups surely ignores the fact that the constitutencies as proposed in these amendments would be so much larger and therfore it is surely much less likely that minority groups would get themselves elected <e>", "<cs> i am very lucky <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to clarify one point which may be particularly relevant to northern ireland <e> <s> if the escape of water on to agricultural or forestry land is the result not of the negligence of the department or the occupier but of the act perhaps the wrongful act <e> <s> of a third party does the occupier recover under the order <e> <s> to take a specific example let us suppose that someone lets off an explosion for some malicious purpose of his own and this fractures the water pipes and causes an escape of water is the department liable <e>", "<cs> fairly accurate my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies and if there is no intervention from the liberal benches i wonder whether he could clear up one point that puzzles me a little <e> <s> in view of the subject matter of the order my noble friend referred to the department of transport but if my noble friend looks at the explanatory note to the order he will see that it states <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend is kind enough to invite me to speak again perhaps i may be permitted to say that the explanatory note seems to state generally that the department of the environment not restricted to northern ireland but the department of the environment which is a united kingdom department will make

decisions that disastrously a section of it was reduced to two lanes <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us will feel that the manifest sourness of the observations made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington derives from his disappointment at the manifest success of this share issue <e> <s> is my noble friend aware also that many of us on this side of the house fully share the views of the noble <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friends will be prepared to consider seriously the warning given by my noble friend lord home a few moments ago <e> <s> it is embarrassing

he has given <e>", "<cs> we have in the glc a very good example of the weakness of that method of limiting activity <e> <s> the glc was expressly not given police powers <e> <s> it has set up and is to this day operating a police committee <e>", "<cs> transport <e>", "<cs> this has been a less polemical debate than any and i think i have been present at all of them so far during the committee

distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the pleasant convention of this house that subsequent speakers express gratitude to the opener of the debate for opening and initiating it but on this occasion it is no mere empty convention <e> <s> i am sure the house as a whole is very much indebted to the noble lord lord rochester for introducing a debate on this most important subject and perhaps i may also add that his sense of timing is clearly impeccable <e> <s> i believe that that proposition is supported above all by the remainder of the list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the understandable emotion of the noble lord opposite is it nonetheless fair to say that so far from this situation resulting from having a government who did not care about the railways the figures of government investment which my noble friend on the front bench has given show the contrary <e> <s> is it not a paradox that it is the greater efficiency obtained as a result of that massive investment

investment can bring about <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord molloy is also wrong historically in as much as the first earnings-related pensions in the national insurance scheme were provided for by the national insurance act <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord mulley had many far better reasons the house will agree for resigning from the then unhappy administration <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware of the fact that in aviation may day is a distress signal <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals called in aid very justifiably if he will allow me to say so his own very distinguished record in connection with the voluntary bodies <e> <s> i hope i may pay him the flattery of imitation and say that i can claim

of that speed first has an element of uncertainty about it and secondly that it is interesting and i am indebted to the noble lord for his intervention to consider what happened to the voluntary bodies up to when the support that they received from the glc was very modest indeed <e>", "<cs> if the right reverend prelate had studied the letter from mr bowness if it be identical to mine with the care which the responsibilities of his great diocese might make difficult for him he would have noted that earlier on in the letter mr bowness refers to the fact that <e>", "<cs> is this a speech

made is quite an outrage and it imposes on their staff very considerable stresses and difficulties <e>", "<cs> it may be that after that devastating speech by the noble and learned lord lord denning the noble lord lord hooson will save the time of the committee by withdrawing his amendment promptly because it seems really to have been destroyed <e> <s> but if he does not rise to do so i want to make just one comment as one who since he went into the house of commons the best part of years ago has been interested in delegated legislation about the second amendment we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> may i echo the words of the noble baroness in response to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i think that i speak for all the committee in saying how deeply impressed we have been with the way he has handled this immensly complex bill particularly in the circumstances in which he was if i may so colloquially put it thrown in at the deep end so shortly before your lordships started on the bill <e> <s> i am quite sure that his good temper and intellectual grasp of the bill has greatly facilitated our discussions <e> <s> for my part i should like most respectfully to thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house is in rather an odd situation on the second reading of this very important bill <e> <s> first for the past few weeks we have had not so much leaks as the equivalent of a burst water main of information about the forthcoming statement including wholly accurate forecasts in the press on the treatment of the state earnings related pension <e> <s> then after two speeches on the second reading from my noble friend and the noble baroness on the front bench opposite we had one of the most important statements this house has heard for a long time on the same subject as the bill <e> <s> although i am too old a hand to start trying to pronounce on the statement without having read it carefully it seems possible that it makes a part of the bill out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that my noble friend is not suggesting that another place conducts its business better than this house <e> <s> that would be a remarkable observation <e> <s> however she is perfectly right in saying that i had the task of doing that in another place and that made me admire all the more the way that she introduced the bill and then indulged in considerable exertions in reply to criticisms of the statement <e> <s> i am not as i said going to seek to comment at this stage on the statement <e> <s> with the noble lord on the liberal benches i hope and believe that we shall be debating that before very long <e> <s> it is of such great importance that this house would not be fulfilling its proper role if the government did not find time for a debate upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who are anxious to encourage the south african government in the reformist policies which they are now adopting find our task made much more difficult by questions of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the fact that these decisions have now at long last been made and announced will cause great relief in all who are interested in the development of our civil aviation who have been very much concerned about the delay in dealing with this admittedly difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is a matter which is of concern not only to the national organisations referred to by the noble lord opposite but also to the whole public as consumers and that in this era of working wives late opening of shops is of very great social value <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bancroft referred very justifiably indeed to the dialectical skill of my noble friend the minister and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a little misunderstanding about this <e> <s> it is undoubtedly the case that there has been great agitation in richmond <e> <s> i myself like my noble friend lord fanshawe have had a good deal of correspondence but i think that most of my correspondents like if i may say so my noble friend have misunderstood the effect of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> they seem to feel that trunking necessarily involves large-scale <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sat in another place for years for an outer london borough of which as it so happens the noble and learned lord on the front bench opposite was for some years recorder i naturally followed his argument with very special interest <e> <s> the noble and learned lord spent a good deal of time spelling out the difficulties that would result from the change in the general system although i thought he under-rated the flexibility and the administrative capacity of the boroughs <e> <s> in the case of the one i know i think it would probably be able to absorb these responsibilities without the great increase in bureaucracy which i was somewhat amused coming from that bench to hear the noble and learned lord criticising <e>", "<cs> my lords over mans years i have formed the view that if one had any doubt on a matter one should follow the judgments of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i found that i could think consistently with that past practice this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will i think immediately recognise i was not seeking to deal with the constitutional issue <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway can speak for himself on that and few people could do so better <e> <s> i was dealing with what i understood to have been the argument of the noble lord on the liberal benches that because we had conceded lord drumalbyns amendment therefore it inevitably followed that we must accept this <e> <s> that was the impression the noble lords argument left on my mind <e> <s> if that were not so then i am very happy indeed to acquit him of what i think he himself now accepts would have been a very erroneous and irrational line of argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend on the front bench is about to do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot help expressing admiration for the pertinacity with which in and out of season noble lords on the liberal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted as ever to my noble friend for amplifying and clarifying the point that i was putting with perhaps a brevity open to criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords is not a major consideration in either loans to or trade with nicaragua to make sure that one gets paid <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend make it clear as i think he was seeking to do that the international ranking which he gave to those two great british companies related solely to their size and turnover and conveyed no imputation whatever against the well known very high quality of their products and their technological advance <e>", "<cs> my lords if one had not known it already i think all your lordships would have sensed that the noble lord lord birkett is the son of the man who was in his day perhaps the greatest advocate at the bar <e> <s> in a hereditary house it is nice to see hereditary abilities coming out <e> <s> one can understand if it is not impertinent on my part to say so that when you have been doing the kind of obviously fascinating and interesting job that the noble lord has been doing on behalf of the greater london council he would be i do not know whether it is more or less than human or anyway quite different from human kind if he did not intensely resent its breaking up and feel instinctively that those to whom these functions would be entrusted would not do them as well as he did <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the anxieties about the arts to which the noble lord lord strabolgi has referred and on that point i think your lordships will want to await what the noble earl on the front bench who is of course the minister for the arts says i suggest to your lordships that this amendment simply will not do <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will look at subsection which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the reference was to the director of the national theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not agree to put this amendment into the bill basically for two reasons <e> <s> first of all as the noble lord lord ennals has admitted it is quite illogical to apply it in the case of london and not apply it in the case of the metropolitan counties <e> <s> i would suggest on the contrary that the need for seeing that this information is available is probably greater in the metropolitan counties than it is in the rather more sophisticated atmosphere of the metropolis <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord and indeed i draw on my own experience when i was minister of pensions and national insurance some years ago that there is real need to see that those most in need are informed of the benefits to which they have a right <e> <s> that is enormously important <e> <s> but an amendment of this sort first of all excluding the provinces and confined <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend indicate that the point made by the noble lord lord shackleton is one which the government accept namely that in the regrettable absence of a multilateral agreement her majestys government do not rule out acting unilaterally <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain irony is there not in that the voluntary bodies which pride themselves on being voluntary bodies should be thought to want from the point of view of the local authorities an involuntary scheme <e> <s> does not that paradox illustrate the difficulty which this amendment however well intentioned as it obviously is will give rise to <e> <s> the whole hope of dealing with this issue under this bill is that the boroughs in london and the districts in the metropolitan counties will take up their responsibilities and in particular the responsibilities in respect of the voluntary bodies which have been discharged previously by the top-tier authorities <e> <s> but if they are to be compelled to do so and if a compulsory scheme is to be imposed upon them surely anyone who has had any experience as i have of local authorities will know that that would get the whole thing off to a bad start <e> <s> it will appear to them to be something which is being imposed on them by parliament and not a proper challenge to them for voluntary effort <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> i absolutely agree with what she has just said but does she appreciate that this amendment does not provide that basic grant <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that these people have been detained for all these years without trial <e> <s> is this not contrary to the general world understanding on human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the catering industry in this country has a very good record of training schemes for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords if this amendment were put into the bill it would remove what seems to some of us to be an important safeguard against extravagance and over-manning <e> <s> it has been the sad experience in the past when reorganisations in local government have taken place that often there have been sudden increases in bureaucracy with the recruitment of additional staff a growth of staff which has involved an additional burden on the ratepayers <e> <s> as i understand it the words which this amendment seeks to leave out of the clause are there largely to enable the secretary of state to stop such a situation should it arise <e> <s> should there be no such extravagances no such over-manning i should have thought it very unlikely that my right honourable friend would find it necessary to exercise these powers but it is really an exercise in rather facile optimism to believe that there is no risk of this happening <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will permit me to intervene <e> <s> surely her argument falls because although at the end of the day rate capping could arise and restrict expenditure meanwhile in the absence of the words which the noble baroness seeks to delete from clause additional and unnecessary staff could be recruited and employed and require redundancy rights <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton proposed this amendment in tones of almost virgin innocence the suggestion being that it was only a mild and reasonable variation of the bill <e> <s> it seems to me and so i think it will seem to many of your lordships to be a great deal more than that <e> <s> it seems to me to amount to an attempt far from the first during our discussions on this bill to set up a powerful top tier authority in both the glc area and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> the noble lord was a little evasive when my noble friend lord elton asked him about the proposed duration of this power <e> <s> the amendment is perfectly clear <e> <s> it covers and the years thereafter with no limitation of time whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords as the amendment stands it is therefore a permanent proposal <e> <s> i hear that the noble lord admits this <e> <s> this is of course a challenge to the main concept of the bill because it is proposing to set up this powerful body on top of the boroughs to which it is the purpose of the bill that power should be entrusted <e> <s> the noble lord at one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the matter is quite as simple as has been suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> regrettably it is the fact that to date there has been a singular lack of co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that common observation suggests that there is more alcoholism drug addiction and mental illness in the ranks of the cnd than there is in the armed forces of our loyal american allies <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if allegations of the grossest character are made by someone associated with an outside organisation against the gallant forces of our american allies they must be prepared to take it as well as to give it <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friend lord mottistone in his suggestion that the idea of a register of private pension schemes should be dropped <e> <s> i do so for two reasons <e> <s> first as i said on second reading there is a danger from this bill generally that the increased intervention by the state in connection with the operation of the private schemes may well have the effect of discouraging either their introduction or their expansion <e> <s> all the machinery of a register though it may not weigh very heavily in the decisions that have to be made may add a little to that discouragement <e> <s> if your lordships look at schedule you will see the length and complexity of the provisions required for this register <e> <s> i think your lordships will feel that if we can avoid it we ought to because a system as complex as <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble lords perfectly proper question <e> <s> if he will study the clause and still more the schedule he will see that there is no protection there against a bucket shop pension scheme <e> <s> i share the noble lords apprehension about such schemes <e> <s> they have been known to exist and they do a lot of harm and cause much social misery <e> <s> but i do not believe that there would he any protection in the registry such as would justify its coming into being to prevent such schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he would amplify it a little and say not only that the judgments have not called in question the sentences imposed by the english courts but that in law they have no power to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware notwithstanding the question put to him by the noble lord lord mishcon that he has proved himself perfectly capable of giving a clear answer to a clear question and that the house is grateful to him for that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend lord rodney whose initiative on this bill all of us welcome enormously a question on the intention purpose and effect of subsection of clause that subsection includes as your lordships will see not only the penalties of imprisonment which your lordships have just been debating but also a penalty of any amount <e>", "<cs> i am much indebted to my noble friend <e> <s> if i may say so respectfully i think that he has this just about right <e> <s> by putting in the fine of any amount he paves the way for taking over the assets of these people <e> <s> i am sure that he is wise not to include in a private members bill the awful technicalities of sequestration which i think will try to the utmost even the resources of a government department even dare i say it those of the noble baroness on the front bench <e> <s> so i think with respect that my noble friend has this about right and i hope that your lordships will support him in it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend contemplate introducing into these important discussions the concept of applying to air piracy what has been international law for centuries in respect of sea piracy namely that any power able to apprehend the pirates is entitled to take them try them and on conviction execute them <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble baroness who has just sat down and the noble baroness lady stedman in moving this amendment seemed to take the line that the joint planning body the joint planning committee contemplated by this amendment is a boon of enormous value to the areas concerned <e> <s> if they will allow me to say so with respect the whole tone of their speeches was that london was being favoured and the other metropolitan counties discriminated against by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords an amendment moved by a former chief secretary to the treasury and seconded on the marshalled list at least by another which claims to help to restrain public expenditure would seem to come with rather formidable credentials <e> <s> but i am not sure that those credentials really stand up to analysis because this is as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has pointed out simply a repetition of an amendment brought forward on report with the compulsory powers involved in that previous amendment eliminated <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> of course i accept that principal is the qualification but that would not seem if it is to mean anything at all to let in a broad amendment on a broad issue of policy which plainly does not come within the qualifications as set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would he say what level it was when he took up office <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who moved the amendment began by challenging me to raise the question as to its appropriateness under the <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest in my speech nor do i think that the powers under section should be totally abolished <e> <s> but i agree with what i think the noble lord lord tordoff has in mind that the abuse of these powers by certain authorities in recent years particularly their use for purely party political propaganda should be controlled and restricted <e>", "<cs> it is a good thing to have a good lawyer my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now near the end of a long series of debates on this bill which whatever else they have shown have shown that your lordships house is a lively and sometimes pugnacious place <e> <s> but i should like to begin by echoing the words of both noble baronesses who have just spoken in paying tribute to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> we recall that he was posted and i think that one of the noble baronesses used the inelegant expression pitchforked into his present position just before the bill began owing to the regretted and regrettable illness of his predecessor to whom i think at this moment your lordships would like to extend their sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord goes out of his way to challenge me i am very happy indeed to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not occur to the noble lord that the words of the noble baroness could very properly exclude schools that did not have delicate or physically weak children and there are a good many <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the teachers have given any reason either for their unwillingness to have discussions with the secretary of state or to go to arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords my first and most pleasant duty is to offer the congratulations of your lordships to the right reverend prelate who has just resumed his seat after an immensely impressive maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure all noble lords recognised how excellent was the right reverend prelates grasp of the problems of the people in his great diocese <e> <s> i am sure they will be grateful that he devoted his maiden speech in your lordships house to this subject and to their needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully take that point and i shall come to deal with it at adequate but i hope not inordinate length <e>", "<cs> all right my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble lord opposite was kindly taking up a point that i made in my speech so it was not wholly irrelevant <e> <s> but i apologise for apparent bad manners <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has referred to me and has made reference in his very recent remarks about air traffic control <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the fact that the original gatwick plan with its two runways was taken in full knowledge of all the air traffic control problems involved <e>", "<cs> my lords as this matter concerns the rights and procedure of the whole house i think it is right that there should be a brief comment also from this side of the chamber <e> <s> like noble lords opposite i welcome the governments decision to abandon the idea of taking this bill through all its stages in one day <e> <s> i would venture to say that it seems to me that the procedure of taking a bill through all stages in one day is one which only the most exceptional circumstances would justify if there were any opposition to it in any section of the house <e> <s> it is a procedure which if the house is unanimous upon it may well have to take effect as it did in the case to which the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has referred <e> <s> but i think my noble friend has rightly interpreted the feelings of the house in now allowing two days for the discussion of this bill <e> <s> that seems a sensible solution <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the type of ban which the noble lord opposite has suggested simply have the usual effect of these bans in other words we should lose the market and chile would get the same arms from our competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that somewhat inconclusive reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether it is not a fact that if the government are either to abolish wages councils

friend aware that i do not need instruction in aberrations from the noble lord lord rochester but that my question was i thought framed with the statesmanlike moderation which i had hoped would appeal to the noble lord lord rochester in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend or at least his right honourable friend when he <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord opposite for assuming the role of the late doctor freud may i ask my noble friend whether it was not perfectly clear to him as i think it was to the house that i was seeking to invite his attention to the ridiculous situation in which in london the london boroughs are in two separate and rival associations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has such a beguiling method of speaking that he tends to lull the house he certainly tends to lull me into a feeling that this amendment really is not much of a change <e> <s> however your lordships will recall that it is an amendment which goes against the whole spirit and purpose of the bill which has now been through both houses that wherever possible functions shall be transferred to the boroughs <e> <s> it proposes to take these very important i do not underrate their importance traffic management problems into the second tier of a three-tier structure and in that way to frustrate the general purpose of the bill

practical aspect of whether or not you want trunked a road which goes near your home <e> <s> that is a very important issue to local people but it is not an issue which raises party political differences <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly honest about it <e> <s> he agrees with me <e> <s> it is contrary to the whole spirit of the bill <e> <s> there is no justification i suggest to your lordships for picking out traffic management and treating it separately from the way in which parliament in its wisdom has decided all the other functions at present exercised by the glc or the metropolitan counties are to be exercised under the bill <e> <s> whatever your view on a particular aspect your lordships must see that to introduce this one separate element of this overall authority will cause considerable confusion in practice and be thoroughly damaging to the general approach of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was seeking to make and which i hoped the noble lord had understood was that over the greater part of the bill parliament has concluded its discussions <e> <s> the only issues open are those that arise on those of our amendments which are sent back <e> <s> the point of my argument was that the main pattern of the bill has already been decided upon by parliament <e>",

westminster for example can hunt cockroaches in the kitchens of london clubs but is forbidden and unable to prosecute hospitals which have dirty kitchens which endanger the lives and health of their patients <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend address herself to this question <e> <s> if it is necessary for the protection of public health that those who in private catering allow dirty kitchen conditions to arise should be liable to prosecution why then in hospitals where as she admits the need for cleanliness is at least as great should a similar sanction not be available if lapses occur <e> <s> indeed as the recent report quoted by the noble lord lord ennals indicates they are in fact occurring <e>", "<cs> my lords as the greater london council now has only five months of life before it i should like to ask my noble friend why it is necessary to take over to the next session a bill conferring general powers on it <e>", "<cs> my lords my first and most agreeable duty is to offer the congratulations of i am sure the whole house to the right reverend prelate who has just addressed us on his very impressive and if he will allow me to say so very moving maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure the house was immensely interested to hear that his views on the question of overseas aid go back to the days when he served in south korea then a recipient of that benefit <e> <s> he must have a feeling of pride when he sees south korea today to know that he played a part in the remarkable build-up and success of that country <e> <s> the right reverend prelate spoke with great authority and i know i express the views of all of us when with very great sincerity i express the hope that he will be able occasionally to spare time from the affairs of this extremely important diocese to come and give us the benefit of his advice in further speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noblelord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is good enough to refer to me and to suggest that i should support the reverend jesse jackson because of my general pro-american sympathies <e> <s> the noble lord may be aware that when it came to an american election mr jackson was very heavily defeated <e>", "<cs> my lords in the preliminaries <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wants me to make a long intervention in the course of his very audible speech i will amplify the point <e> <s> so unattractive as a candidate did mr jackson appear to be that his party eliminated him in their preliminary steps <e> <s> i did not wish to be unkind to the reverend gentleman but that is the fact and the noble lord has compelled me to state it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that not particularly helpful reply <e> <s> however i should like to ask him whether the government will give an early indication of their determination to do something about the tragic increase in serious accidents on the motorways <e> <s> is he aware and does he give due weight to the fact that on the magnificent highways in the united states the maximum speed limit is miles per hour <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend who has been asked a question about the gross earnings of these two sections of society have with him the net figures after tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend for that helpful answer <e> <s> in view of the governments policy of encouraging home ownership and the obvious incentive to the individual to buy his home if he can pass it on to his children will my noble friend ensure without anticipating the budget statement that his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer considers very specifically this particular levy and has in mind that an exception in respect of the principal home or residence already exists in respect of cgt <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the first supplementary question of the noble lord lord barnett displayed for him an astonishing ignorance of the current level of property values <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals is not at the moment in his place but he knows that i have the very greatest admiration for him not least for the courage with which he has faced up to quite serious physical disability very recently <e> <s> that no doubt accounts for his absence at the moment <e> <s> but even in his absence i should like to say as i would have said with greater pleasure in his presence that i think he made a mistake in asking your lordships to debate this afternoon both the national health service and the problems of social security <e> <s> both of these are enormous subjects of the highest complexity and of the greatest possible importance <e> <s> each one of them would have made a much more satisfactory debate than i am afraid we are going to get out of the mixture <e> <s> it is a mistake which derives from the mistake made some years ago i have always thought that it was a very bad mistake when the old ministry of pensions and national insurance was merged with the department of health <e> <s> both of those departments had an important role to play and i have never ceased to criticise the folly of those in both parties who brought those two departments together <e> <s> i should myself like to see them divorced <e>", "<cs> my lords if the right reverend prelate will wait for a moment i will of course give way to him as is the normal custom of this house <e> <s> however perhaps he will find it more convenient to allow me to make my point so that he may answer it <e> <s> he cannot anticipate the point i am about to make <e> <s> my point is that we have a changing economic situation <e> <s> there are a great many people particularly from the heavy industries <e> <s> in the north who will never be re-employed in their old industries and it is dangerous to let them think that they may be so re-employed <e> <s> it is however essential to persuade the newer high technology developing industries and th rest to move into those parts of the country and then to provide the employment which people in the right reverend prelates diocese desperately seek and which all of us desperately wish to see them obtain <e> <s> i will now give way to the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> however i made a note of his remarks at the time and when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course some element of accuracy in that observation <e> <s> it is all the more reason we should encourage the new high technology industries which can offer employment to the former miner as well as to his family to move to such areas <e> <s> the noble lord will understand as well as anybody that present legislation dealing with sex discrimination makes it very difficult when establishing new industries to see to it that the man rather than his wife gets the job <e> <s> an employer who attempts to do so soon finds himself in court <e> <s> nevertheless i take the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> in any event they receive <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what are the names of the six inspired gentlemen referred to in the question and what are their scientific qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that the intention is only to consider an airfield for emergency use <e> <s> surely in the modern world if a community is to survive it must have a regular means of access by air <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people in this country welcome moves towards providing some measure of defence against the menace of attack by missiles <e> <s> is he also aware that many people in this country regard the observation of the noble lord opposite that it would be a bad objective to obtain valuable contracts giving employment in this country as rather odd <e>", "<cs> my lords while my noble friend is right to draw attention to the very proper actions of the government in general in view of the fact that he himself has disclosed that some of this work is relieved of vat charges surely it would be both rational and easy to extend this to cover all work and thereby prevent money subscribed by the public from being subjected to an unexpected and unwelcome tax <e>", "<cs> like other noble lords i have only just seen this amendment and therefore i hope the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will forgive me if i ask him a very simple question as to its meaning <e> <s> does the amendment mean that the four-hour limit shall be applied only to those shops authorised by the bill <e> <s> or will it also bite on shops which already lawfully open on sundays <e> <s> it is an important point which the noble lord owes it to the committee to clarify <e>", "<cs> my lords may i despite the protests that have been made express my gratitude to my noble friend for undertaking the physical endurance of reading this long and immensely important statement <e> <s> listening to it it seems to me that it is probably one of the most important government statements that has been made for many years and if my noble friend will allow me to say so it was absolutely right that it should be repeated in full to this house because it would have been derogatory to the standing of the house had that not been done <e> <s> perhaps i may also support what was said by the noble baroness opposite that a debate on the white paper is essential <e> <s> may i as my noble friend the leader of the house is present suggest that it be a two-day debate <e> <s> it would be a pity if these complex matters were crowded into one day with the house sitting late and the time for speeches restricted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stallard doubted whether there was any consumer demand for freedom of opening on sundays <e> <s> obviously this demand can only be conclusively demonstrated when an opportunity is given <e> <s> plainly if there is no consumer demand appearing then very few shops will open <e> <s> they will open to meet consumer demand only when they are free to do so <e> <s> therefore i suggest to the noble lord that it is quite wrong to say now while present legal restrictions continue that there is no consumer demand <e> <s> against that statement the consumers association which has already been quoted speaks for consumers in what i think is a very representative capacity <e> <s> i have a letter from them dated as recently as the th november in which they emphatically state that they feel that the restrictions should be repealed <e> <s> until it has been demonstrated to the contrary that there is no consumer demand and that the consumers association is wrong i am inclined to suggest to your lordships that we should take seriously what this responsible body says <e>", "<cs> in a moment with the greatest of pleasure if i might just finish a sentence when perhaps it will be more convenient <e> <s> if it were proposed to compel shops to open then that would be a perfectly fair comment <e> <s> it is not it is simply proposed to allow them to do so and that it should cease to be a breach of the criminal law if shops do so open <e> <s> now i shall happily give way <e>", "<cs> if it were necessary to support such an appeal i should be happy to do so but in fact one knows as my noble friend knows perfectly well that our noble friends lord glenarthur and lady trumpington always look most carefully at amendments and if they reject them it is because they think that as in this particular case the amendment is nonsense <e> <s> and with respect this limitation to a shop manned or womaned by five people only is nonsense <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the right reverend prelate i do not accept that argument at all <e> <s> if a small shop is developing and expanding when this bill becomes law as i hope that it will it will seek to trade on sunday and during the week <e> <s> is the right reverend prelate suggesting that such a shop should restrict its employment to five people during the week in order not to forfeit the right to trade on sundays <e> <s> if he is he is not only seeking to inhibit the growth of that enterprise he is seeking to restrict the opportunities of giving employment <e> <s> it is in the area of retail distribution and of the service industries generally that some of the best hopes of dealing with the problem of unemployment arise <e> <s> i say to the right reverend prelate with enormous respect that the suggestion that this is a way to make a distinction between sunday and other trading is an extraordinarily dangerous and ill-considered argument to use <e>", "<cs> will the right reverend prelate allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think that he has slightly misunderstood my argument i am sure genuinely <e> <s> my argument was that there was a demand but that a conclusive view of it which would convince even the noble lord lord stallard must await the actual experience <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will recall that a few moments ago he himself said of edmonton an area of which he claimed considerable knowledge that if deregulation took effect sunday would be the second heaviest shopping day <e> <s> is not that an indication that he himself regards demand as likely to be heavy <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way admirer though i am of the noble lords sense of humour may i reassure him that it was not his display of humour which aroused my merriment but a totally different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that whatever the complexities and difficulties of the system of control most responsible opinion feels that given the scale of current local goverment expenditure it is essential to the proper management of the british economy that that expenditure should be firmly and definitely limited lest the whole of economic policy be undermined by it <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that some of us listened almost with horror to the observation of the noble baroness opposite that it was not the amount that the national economy could afford but the needs of local authorities that should determine the total amount <e> <s> is he aware that it is that kind of irresponsibility which produces regular financial crises under labour governments <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble baroness has fully amplified and confirmed my own earlier observation that it is the policy of the party opposite to allow unlimited expenditure to be undertaken by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the noble baroness very carefully i hope that she will show me a similar courtesy to allow unlimited expenditure by local authorities to be undertaken regardless of the effect on the national economy <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that it is that attitude which explains the financial failures of successive labour governments <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question raised by the noble lord lord grimond on the width of verges can my noble friend confirm that fairly wide verges on these roads are essential in the event of snow in order to make snow clearance possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i add to the good wishes particularly to my noble friend who has so gallantly recently taken up the quite serious burden of ministerial duties which i think the house as a whole would agree he has discharged to the great satisfaction of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said this is the last of quite a long series of glc bills but it seems to me to call for some explanation as to why it is necessary in the middle of january to start our proceedings on a glc general powers bill when as your lordships know the glc itself will cease to exist at the end of the month after next <e> <s> it seems a quite extraordinary proceeding <e>", "<cs> it is my lords as the noble lord lord ponsonby from a sedentary position which is a little surprising in the case of a chief whip points out it is acting in part as agent for the boroughs <e> <s> but in fact if the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede looks at the bill he will see that it also contains provisions which increase the powers of the glc itself <e> <s> part i of the bill does just that <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord is going to have a look at it <e> <s> it does in fact contain in the recital what seemed to me to be the astonishing words <e>", "<cs> my lords part i refers to the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the disparity in numbers of those noble lords who have put down their names to speak on these two matters a clear indication of the complete satisfaction of opinion with the governments education policy <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the figures given by the noble lord on the front bench opposite a trifle misleading inasmuch as they ignore the fact that in the case of the people concerned at least per cent <e> <s> of these increases are then taken away in taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that opinion generally is more likely to attach importance to the experienced views expressed by lord carrington than to the views referred to by the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord sainsbury speaks as the committee know with considerable authority on the subject <e> <s> i follow him very much encouraged by what he has said and encouraged also by the fact that this helps me to overcome the diffidence which i always feel in disagreeing with the noble and learned lord lord denning for whom like all your lordships i have the most profound respect <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene because he referred to me <e> <s> surely the proposal in this amendment is that shops should open up to pm <e> <s> does that not exclude church attendance at the time that most people go to church on sunday mornings for those called upon to work during those hours <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble baroness who moved this amendment in such agreeable terms one question as to what she has in mind <e> <s> as i understand the effect of her amendment it is that the protection given by the various sections of the act to shopworkers instead of going when they have attained the age of should continue until they have reached the age of <e> <s> my question is this <e> <s> why does she draw the line there <e> <s> i need hardly say in this chamber that there are a good many people over the age of who work <e> <s> one needs only to look around to see the number of extremely distinguished examples of that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows that that is a hypothetical question <e> <s> he need not have worried about saying before the noble lord sits down because we are in committee so i can reply to him <e> <s> if any of those amendments are moved i shall listen to the arguments for them <e> <s> i am not at the moment convinced of their validity i am not convinced that there is any necessity for them but i hope that i am as fairminded as anyone of your lordships and i shall listen to any arguments that may be adduced <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord lord stallard is considering that point may i raise another query <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not understand the amendment technically <e> <s> it seeks to amend section of the shops act and to add various bits to it <e> <s> however the committee has already agreed that section of the shops act shall not apply to anybody over the age of <e> <s> that is now excluded <e> <s> is the noble lord lord stallard arguing that he can go on amending those provisions and that they will have any effect on anybody over the age of <e>", "<cs> may i also comment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy appears to accept my proposition that the only effect of the amendment will be on the provisions in respect of those under in which case i must say that the noble lord lord stallard did not make that clear <e> <s> on the contrary his whole speech was directed to the general question of protection for workers in this industry <e> <s> if the effect of the amendment is as it seems to me and i think that the noble lord lord mccarthy accepts that only on those aged to that is not to say that that is not important but i think that the noble lord lord stallard might have told the committee that to begin with <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord accept because he has not indicated one way or the other whether he does or does not that the effect of the amendment if accepted would be to bring up to <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister will no doubt deal with the basic question as to whether it is right to insert in the bill a statutory provision in respect of paid holidays for shopworkers <e> <s> i have some doubts as to that general issue but it is i believe a matter for my noble friend to deal with <e> <s> i wish to raise only two specific points on the amendment that the noble baroness has moved <e>", "<cs> whatever view your lordships may take on my noble friends amendment i am sure they will wholly agree that schedule is a miracle of bad drafting <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will speak somewhat firmly to his department and to the parliamentary draftsman and ask them not in future to serve up to parliament such a professionally incompetent piece of work <e> <s> but that does not conclude the issue <e>", "<cs> i will just finish the sentence and then i shall give way to the noble lord with the greatest pleasure <e> <s> i was only going to say that a great deal of noise emerges from fleet street of one sort or another <e>", "<cs> i believe that such an employee should certainly be able to obtain redress under his contract of employment <e> <s> if his employer seeks arbitrarily to alter the terms of his employment after he has joined the firm i have not the slightest doubt that he would have a remedy there <e> <s> he would have also a very genuine cause for complaint <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> what he says is the exact converse of what i said <e> <s> i went out of my way to make clear that i accepted the view that those who had joined the shop working trade on the basis of sunday work being illegal should be protected but that there was no reason whatever for applying this to new entrants <e> <s> that is quite the opposite of what my noble friend is trying to attribute to me <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord bruce of donington is right does not that confirm the wisdom of her majetys government in giving first place to combating inflation <e>", "<cs> hear hear my lords <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord sandford has made two interesting suggestions and although i do not go the whole way with him

this measure will create i think he used the word turbulence in the distributive trades <e> <s> i very much doubt that <e> <s> first of all one has to allow for the fact that a great many shops are already open on sundays and have been for a very considerable time <e> <s> there is going to be no sudden transition <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i failed to make clear to the noble lord the view that i was expressing and perhaps i may try again <e> <s> i accept that some protection is right where parliament changes the law affecting existing employees <e>

reading than to the debate on this rather limited amendment <e> <s> i shall confine myself to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> there is force in what she says if sufficient time is allowed <e> <s> however the amendment to which she is speaking would not allow time for patterns to settle down in a form or shape as regards which it would be possible to form an intelligent judgment as to whether that form or shape was good or bad <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> if we were talking of a period of five years it might be a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most of us think that the bma has done a considerable public service by bringing out so vividly the danger of smoking and that their report is not as the noble viscount opposite said alarmist but just alarming <e>", "<cs> answer <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether before this matter was raised by the noble lord the leader of the opposition any request was made for a private notice question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend could clear up two points which even after the statement still remain uncertain in my mind <e> <s> first in the complex arrangements of this matter is it possible to put the agreement reached with all the other teachers unions into effect in the absence of agreement by the national union of teachers <e> <s> secondly have the other unions apart from the national union of teachers agreed with the employers proposals for what the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee so rightly calls a clarification of teachers responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords before i seek to trouble your lordships with one or two arguments on the general policies of the bill i wanted to ask my noble friend to answer not now perhaps but when he winds up three specific questions about it <e> <s> i am happy to tell your lordships that those questions have become two because my noble friend indicated that he was proposing to amend the insult to this house which at the moment stands in clause <e> <s> it would be wholly wrong to entrust the approval of these important codes of practice only to another place <e> <s> i was glad to hear my noble friend acknowledge that <e> <s> if he had not indicated that he was proposing to put down an amendment i should have done so <e> <s> even now we may have to race to the committee office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> of course i shall read her speech <e> <s> i shall do so with enormous pleasure from a literary point of view if from no other <e> <s> but i did not understand her to give that clear assurance <e> <s> however that is a second reading point <e> <s> with great respect most of the other things to which she referred are committee points <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> this house has on many occasions carried amendments to government bills including the major local government bill of last session <e> <s> in so far as his personal argument to me is concerned he may care to recall that on the nationality bill i carried an amendment against the government giving british citizenship to the citizens of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of charges can my noble friend tell your lordships whether the new companies will have the same arbitrary discretion that the current water authorities have to decide whether any particular customer shall be charged on meter or on rateable value <e> <s> can he also say whether the new companies will inherit the in my view most mistaken title of authority which they were given under the previous arrangements <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if you call a body an authority its almost inevitable psychological effect is that it becomes authoritarian <e> <s> as these bodies have always been simply suppliers of a commodity will the opportunity be taken to get rid of this word authority <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend happy as i am sure he is to confirm the very considerable public service performed by the noble lord lord mellish in this context and also by sir nigel broackes <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran subject to anything he may say by way of correction would have the effect that on the expiry of three years from royal assent of the bill it would lapse <e> <s> there would be no provision as i understand it for continuation by statutory order <e> <s> it would simply lapse and the government of the day would at that time have either to let it lapse and revert to the present position or alternatively to introduce a completely new bill <e> <s> for that reason if i am right about that and the noble lord is always most willing to be helpful in correcting one if one gets something wrong the comparison with the seatbelts act is misleading because that had provision for its continuance if parliament so approved <e> <s> this has none <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord turns his back to me while he addresses a question to me <e> <s> will he deal with this point <e> <s> he is perfectly right so far as he has gone but if the amendment were carried those of us who believe that these restrictions are out of date and should go would have to go through a completely new bill on the lines of the present one <e> <s> although that would involve the pleasurable experience of hearing a great deal from the noble lord himself it might involve other factors which would seem unnecessary <e> <s> parliament is taking a great deal of trouble over this measure <e> <s> it seems rather otiose to seek to go though the whole process again after so short a time as three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what authority the noble lord has for saying that i told him that i would be happy with a provision of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not because i think it is wholly unnecessary <e> <s> i will give the noble lord this point <e> <s> i think that it would be less damaging than this amendment which i am glad to see he shows signs of withdrawing <e> <s> but i would still feel that it was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me to remind him if it be necessary that on report stage if the noble lord addressing the house is good enough to give way to another noble lord to whom he has referred that noble lord by long custom of the house is entitled to take advantage of that courtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a curious feature of our debates on this bill that noble lords on the benches opposite seem to have a craving to restrict the opening of shops wherever they can <e> <s> it leads one to wonder why they adopt so restrictionist an attitude <e> <s> the tendency in this country in recent years has been to extend the hours during which shops are open and available to the public <e> <s> we owe a good deal of this to immigrants from the continent of asia from where come hard-working people determined to make a success of their business in the best possible way by providing the service which the public wants <e> <s> many of them have prospered deservedly in my view because they have studied the needs and wishes of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who has just spoken is proposing to go further than the <e>",

no other section of sunday or other workers <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that there are many other occupations involving sunday working such as work in hotels in which a great many women also take part <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the very amendment to which she is speaking deals with people who had undertaken to work on sundays or after pm and now desire to go back on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked what i meant by the word unilaterally <e> <s> it is simple <e> <s> the amendment proposes that there should be two parties to the agreement one shall be free to break it with impugnity and the other shall not <e> <s> i call that unilateral <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say which amendment he is moving <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help wondering whether this amendment whatever its merits or demerits really comes within the scope of this bill <e> <s> i find it difficult to reconcile it with the long title of the bill <e> <s> it is not as i understand it a provision confined to those who work on sundays and again as i understand it is simply an anticipation of the debates and the admirable speeches which we shall no doubt hear in the course of them on the wages bill when it comes here <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he not aware that if you set up a wages council with the power to fix wages you are contemplating that they may do so <e> <s> my objection if he will be good enough to recall what i said was to that possibility <e> <s> if he is telling your lordships that of course the wages council being sensible would never fix wages for these people why on earth put down the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall have to <e>", "<cs> my lords nor me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to invite the attention of this functionary to his duties in respect of restraining from the use of ratepayers money for straight if that be the correct adjective party political propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite the valiant whitewashing efforts of the noble lord on the front bench opposite this particular issue although i agree with my noble friend that it is not as bad as some previous ones is devoted to criticising the decision of parliament and government to abolish the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether the glc has had the courtesy to consult the authorities of this house on this matter and what is the view of the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the chairman of committees has referred to some of <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people with experience of social security administration regard this problem of the very poor during extremely cold conditions as being almost the most difficult practical problem facing the administration of social security because of its changing incidence and as has already been pointed out because of the fact that the exact level of the thermometer is by no means conclusive as to whether or not hardship is being caused <e> <s> in the light of that situation will my noble friend in the consideration which he and his right honourable friend are giving to this matter study the practice and procedure of the old national assistance board some years ago which worked extremely well through the very cold winters of and <e>", "<cs> three points seem to have arisen on this amendment <e> <s> the first was the gallant attempt of the noble baroness to establish that the words which she wants to take out of the bill would be difficult of construction for the judiciary <e> <s> that point has been so effectively demolished by the noble and learned lord lord denning and by my noble friend lord broxbourne that i do not propose to spend any time at all on it <e> <s> i think your lordships will agree that that point is out <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness must have misunderstood me and that must certainly have been my fault <e> <s> i was quoting the words of david blunkett not as words that were to be published at the public expense but far more significantly as an indication of the approach which he and others will make to the new law when this bill is law and therefore we should be forewarned <e> <s> that was the point and i am sorry if i did not explain it with sufficient clarity for the noble baroness to understand it <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me and since he referred to my speech perhaps i may say that if the noble lord was good enough to listen to my speech he will have realised that i was making the point that there are certain leaders of local authorities in this country who want to drive a hole through this bill <e> <s> i thought it right to support that general proposition by quotations and when i give a quotation i attribute it to the person who made it which i think your lordships will agree is the fair and proper way to do it <e>", "<cs> i feel that the situation has been entirely changed by the decision of the committee earlier this afternoon <e> <s> when i read the marshalled list this morning i had very considerable sympathy

have arisen only if the words <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i did not say anything about a voluntary body putting out information <e> <s> i referred to a local authority and a purported

beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he not aware of the fact that british aerospace could not possibly go in for a project of this sort without substantial government support and that therefore the view of the government is of great importance in this matter <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that many of us would deeply regret it if the lead which this country established some years ago in the production of supersonic civil aircraft were to be lost to foreigners <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the attempt of the noble lord lord bruce of donington to read unconcern into his earlier answer strikes no chord with the rest of us who heard what seemed to me a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> is he also aware referring to a reply to another noble lord opposite of the fact that the decision from which the building of concorde flowed was that of the government headed by my noble friend lord home of the hirsel <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friends use of the expression already in connection with tax treatment of this matter give reasonable grounds for hope for th march <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that opinion generally i am sure favours the stage transfer of uprating dates to april so as to make them coincide in time with changes in taxation and rates and that it would congratulate my noble friend and her right honourable friend on their steps towards that end <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister speaks to amendment no <e> <s> a may i know whether the observations of the chair cover also amendment no <e> <s> c which seems to me to be in the same position <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i do not

much in the same boat <e> <s> as my noble friend knows at second reading i raised the question of the position of this house <e> <s> i only tabled my amendment when we came to the first day of the committee stage last week and my noble friend had not then tabled an amendment to bring this house into approval of codes of practice <e> <s> therefore i tabled this amendment simply as a precaution in case the pressure of public business prevented my noble friend from doing so before we reached this stage <e>", "<cs> the adoption of the affirmative procedure in my noble friends admendment in some degree meets the point made by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham with whom <e>", "<cs> it was certainly an affirmative resolution <e> <s> indeed i based my whole argument on the point that it was <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness allow me <e> <s> with respect surely we can comment whether the procedure is affirmative or negative <e> <s> in neither case can we amend <e> <s> the only distinction is that the precedents are rather stronger against rejecting a negative procedure than they are against rejecting an affirmative one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is right in saying that the amendment if adopted would involve consultation only with such associations of employees as the secretary of state saw fit <e> <s> but he knows the trade union world well enough to be aware of the hornets nest that the secretary of state would stir up if he started consulting one trade union and not another <e> <s> he knows very well the friction there <e> <s> it would be clear that under the amendment nalgo would expect to be consulted and perhaps and this is a sobering thought sogat <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend when he replies to clear up a point for me <e> <s> it is not very clear and it arises on the argument of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> if a local authority in order to secure publicity for political purposes gives a sum of money to some either public body or voluntary body outside is that gift of money caught by subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i and i think most of your lordships should like first of all to congratulate my noble friend the minister on his conduct of this bill and one might say on having survived the debates on it <e> <s> there must have been moments during its passage when he would have wished to be back in his earlier avocation of flying a helicopter on to an oil rig in had weather <e> <s> indeed his performance a moment or two ago showed that he has not lost the rescue technique of a helicopter pilot <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall what consensus under governments of a little time ago did to the economy of this country <e> <s> some of them have reasons i think to be unhappy in that recollection <e> <s> i was not a member of a consensus government <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will sit down i shall give way to him at an appropriate moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for sitting down <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are so determined is it not plain that some much more effective sanction than the mere withholding of the defence grant will be required <e> <s> what more effective sanctions have the government in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord opposite is right when he suggests that the

second reading <e> <s> i am bound to say that i still feel a little unhappy at putting into our law a set of establishments known as sex-encounter establishments an expression which might give rise to misunderstanding if indeed it be a misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that charging for glasses was introduced by the labour government in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who has just sat down is making rather heavy weather of this <e> <s> with respect i do not think that he has faced up to the rigidity of what is proposed in the amendment <e> <s> in particular the passage

borough <e> <s> the noble baroness shakes her head but if she looks at her amendment she will see <e>", "<cs> as we are in committee through the minister the noble lord can have the privilege of having it direct <e> <s> the objection is simple <e> <s> it limits the choice solely to people proposed by the london boroughs many of whom have other things to do <e> <s> it prevents these vacancies being used in the discretion either of the city or of my right honourable friend the prime minister for the most suitable person <e> <s> we are not here concerned although one might almost have thought so from what the noble lord lord jenkins of putney said with political appointments <e> <s> we are concerned with people suitable for being museum trustees <e> <s> it may well be the case either because some of the boroughs are not sufficiently interested or because their field of choice is limited that they do not put forward suitable people <e> <s> indeed in the extreme case under this amendment if no borough put forward any names it would be impossible to appoint anyone and the vacancies would remain <e>", "<cs> may <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am perfectly aware of subsection c <e> <s> if the noble baroness looks at it i think she will be quite clear it would be unworkable to have a proposition that it is up to the prime minister or the city of london to say publicly that someone is unsuitable and then presumably find themselves subject to what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale said subject to judicial review as to whether they have acted properly <e> <s> that means that those provisions are so ineffective as to be suitable to be ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall the sorry consequences of the efforts of previous governments to spend their way out of unemployment <e>", "<cs> no no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords being neither cynical nor cautious may i ask my noble friend a couple of questions on his interesting and in many ways welcome statement <e> <s> can he first amplify what he has just said about the likely beneficiaries from this statement <e> <s> are the shire counties which understandably thought they had rather a raw deal under the original arrangements among the substantial beneficiaries <e> <s> secondly can he explain to your lordships what happens in cases where the rate has been fixed and it is technically impossible to alter it <e> <s> will it be the result that ratepayers will be called upon to pay more by way of rates than in the outcome there is any financial justification for <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether there is any relationship between the increased mechanisation of the post office and the notoriously increasing time taken to deliver mail <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figures that he quoted are for collection from the post box for next day delivery and if the post office simply defers that collection its figures look better but the result is worse <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead was right when he said that he did not wholly understand the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i think that he was a little unfair to some noble lords not only on this side of the house but on the cross-benches when he accused those who had criticised the amendment of defending the activities of the national front <e> <s> let me tell him at once that that is completely untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would have the courtesy to wait i shall give way to him in a moment <e> <s> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord entirely confuses two things <e> <s> to defend the activities of the national front would be a very serious allegation against any noble lord <e> <s> the more one knows of that disagreeable and unpleasant body the less any decent-minded man in this country is happy to defend it <e> <s> but it is a totally different thing to say as the noble and learned lord lord denning said with the authority of a court of appeal decision behind him that the national front had established its status as a political party <e> <s> to establish your status as a political party does not amount to defending you <e> <s> let me say at once that there are several political parties in this country authorised recognised political parties and indeed i see some of their representatives here which i do not defend for one moment and it is utter confusion of counsel for the noble lord lord pitt to get very excited and to say that because the noble and learned lord lord denning with high authority behind him held that the national front was a political party he was thereby defending its activities <e> <s> he is more than capable of speaking for himself but as a great admirer of the noble and learned lord i could not forbear to intervene at once on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down i wonder whether he could answer a question which has been in my mind during this short debate <e> <s> if the procedure he has referred to and obviously prefers under the act is employed is the district auditor necessarily involved or can any aggrieved person go to the court and ask to have penalties imposed on those who have authorised the improper expenditure <e> <s> a good deal turns on this because although district auditors are very worthy officials they can never be accused of acting with undue haste as we have seen in recent cases and if action under this bill when it becomes an act has to be taken it would be so much more effective if it could be taken quickly <e> <s> can he answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that at this stage of the bill both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord pitt should seek to resume the discussion which we have had at very considerable length at both report and committee stages on a point about which i fully understand they feel seriously but which i hope they will allow me to say seems a thoroughly bad point <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the commercial advantages to which he refers are very substantial in this matter involving the risk of the transfer of interlining traffic from british airlines and british airports to schipol or charles de gaulle airports <e> <s> in view

post <e>", "<cs> my lords while sympathising with my noble friend in having to repeat this statement may i ask him whether it means that it is the intention of her majestys government to go on pouring large quantities of the taxpayers money into what <e>", "<cs> my lords the only point on which your lordships will unanimously agree is that we have considerable cause for gratitude to my noble friend lord marshall of leeds for introducing this debate in a speech of such authority and balance <e> <s> as your lordships know my noble friend has had a distinguished record in local government and the speech which he gave this afternoon reflected that long and tried experience <e> <s> if this debate is the success i hope it will be it will owe a great deal to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will allow me to intervene all that i did as he may recall was to quote with great approval the statement made by his noble friend lord winstanley that this was the one matter on which the alliance and the liberal party were united <e> <s> if i cannot quote the noble and learned lords front bench spokesman without being told that i am being caustic it will be rather difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the government could help the tourist industry very much by getting the shops bill on the statute book as quickly as possible and by proceeding to amend our archaic if slightly comic licensing laws <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord gray of contin and the noble lord lord ezra both said and rightly that this is a bill of very great importance <e> <s> i would add also that it is an historic measure for it is the first proposal and it may be far from the last to reverse the drive into public ownership which marked the policy of the labour government in and the years following the war <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly well aware of the financial position at the moment particularly resulting from exactly what i was saying a moment or two ago about the governments of the day insisting upon increases in gas prices for the very purpose of making the industry self-financing and thereby relieving demands on the public investment programme <e> <s> i am greatly indebted to the noble lord lord stoddart for giving me the opportunity to explain that point <e> <s> it is freedom from being forced to put up ones prices because one is not allowed to go to the market for new capital <e> <s> that is one of the great advantages that i see in the privatisation of the industry the freeing of the industry from the trammels of government control <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to continue for a moment i may add that in the private sector such is only too apparent <e> <s> i give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it must apply throughout the private sector whether or not it be a monopoly <e> <s> i was going to come to the matter of the monopoly in a moment but the straight answer to the noble lords question is that my observation applies to both <e> <s> the knowledge even if one has a monopoly that one can bust the show by being inefficient by striking or by taking wrong decisions at the board table is a stimulus in both cases <e> <s> it may be a somewhat smaller stimulus where one has something of a monopoly i give the noble lord that point <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting that that was my only argument he did not do me the courtesy of listening to my speech <e> <s> the noble lord may care to remember that i made the important point that after privatisation the industry will be free itself to go to the market for capital as and when it wants and not forced into the queue of the government investment programme with all the problems that those of us who have been in that position know is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not my only argument <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the rather nave document to which the noble lord lord jenkins seeks to draw attention confirm the recently expressed view of mr denis healey that the leadership of the labour party is lacking in practical experience <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are a number of people at any rate in this country who profoundly feel that the fact that we <e>", "<cs> i support the plea of the noble lord lord annan and ask the noble baroness to consider a little further her deeply disappointing reply <e> <s> as i understood it she said that legislation is the wrong instrument and that she will rely on a circular <e> <s> some of us may be sceptical as to whether the kind of people who impose this prohibition will be in the slightest degree affected by a circular or any number of circulars from the department <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that answer and from the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord tordoff will my noble friend bear in mind the anxieties of the right reverend prelates who may be facing the prospect of the deans and chapters of their cathedrals being prosecuted for the criminal offence of selling a bible on sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first of all like to ask this question of the noble baroness who is to reply at the end of the debate <e> <s> what is now the position of the libyan pilots who were until recently under training at the air training school at oxford airport <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will be able to tell the house that they have been sent home because there is an obvious danger in having young men who may be of fanatical views close to and possibly in charge of aircraft at a place not very far from london airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is comparatively little encouragement in his statement that the delays are no more than normal <e> <s> can he tell us what london regional transport are doing to reduce them and the consequent real discomfort hardship and delay to the travelling public <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important and a very complex bill <e> <s> i think that a good many of the points about which your lordships are concerned are basically committee points which no doubt will arise and be debated during the committee stage <e> <s> it is certainly a quite complex bill full of such points <e> <s> but is has one curious omission that is that nowhere in the bill can i see any objectives stated or laid down for the new company or companies which are to operate the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting so early in the noble lords speech <e> <s> the agreement in question was not made by the government it was made by the british airports authority <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend satisfied on the question of the pilots only one of whom he has just said is included in this recent order <e> <s> is he satisfied that it is safe in the present situation to have young libyans flying aircraft in fairly close proximity to london airport <e> <s> is he satisfied that the precaution which his noble friend mentioned yesterday of not allowing them to fly solo can be a sure guarantee against any kamikaze-style effort by one of these young men to produce a collision with civil aircraft going into heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friend very properly declines to comment on procedures in another place for which he has no responsibility whatsoever can he nonetheless tell your lordships whether it is the governments policy that it would be desirable to establish a rail link to the new airport <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the fares to gatwick are higher than fares to further down the line and that the sensible passenger can save money by booking to a further point and getting off at gatwick <e>", "<cs> it is horrible english my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the community is still supplying certain foodstuffs at very low prices to libya and if so whether it has been decided to stop that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a reflection on the efficiency of the post office board that as my noble friend said it has no machinery for monitoring performance on the important matter of deliveries <e> <s> are not the government responsible for appointing the board <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon seemed to be in a rather irritable mood at one part of his speech <e> <s> as one who listened fairly carefully to most of the proceedings of the previous day on this committee stage i thought that his criticisms of my noble friends were wholly unjustified <e> <s> on the contrary i thought that my noble friends showed exemplary patience during proceedings which shall we say <e> <s> did not err on the side of brevity and certainly during one speech where brevity was not a very conspicuous feature <e> <s> therefore i think the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon with his threat that if the governments attitude did not change he would find it necessary to revise his attitude was a little difficult to understand <e> <s> the justification for it is certainly not apparent at any rate not to one noble lord who sat through the proceedings of the previous day <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> we are concerned here not with an organisation such as those the noble lord has described but with a board in which it is proposed to appoint a director general <e> <s> is the noble lord seriously suggesting that the position of that director general is going to be strengthened by ensuring that he does not appoint his own subordinates but that they are appointed by the minister <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not answer the question i put to him <e> <s> i did not put to him the question whether the position of the director general would be undermined <e> <s> i asked the opposite question whether it would be strengthened <e>", "<cs> if i may say so those are highly complimentary observations <e> <s> but i point out to the noble lord that i have not yet had the privilege and neither has he of hearing what the government spokesman is going to say on this amendment <e> <s> i do not know what he is going to say <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has wholly misrepresented me in saying that i suggested that this man should be on his own <e> <s> on the contrary i suggested as he will see if he reads <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not give that assurance <e> <s> this amendment is a little more serious than has been suggested <e> <s> if we make it a statutory condition that the notice must be for six months then as i am sure the committee will appreciate that means that even if there is very good reason for the director to go he may have a disagreement of policy with the government he may have the offer of some major appointment elsewhere he may be becoming unfit because a statutory condition cannot be waived to be legal notice under the act as it will then be it would have to be six months notice <e> <s> on the other hand as my noble friend said if it is in the directors contract then the minister can waive that in appropriate circumstances <e> <s> there is a little more in this amendment than had been suggested and what there is i think is rather bad <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington was almost engaging in the art of prophesy <e> <s> indeed there were moments in the course of his speech which were actually relevant to the amendment though in common fairness i must say there were not very many <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is over-simplifying the matter <e> <s> if a public functionary of that sort is sacked it is unlikely that he will remain completely silent <e> <s> it is unlikely that the press and the media will not ask him for his views and for his justification <e> <s> it is even unlikely that he may not have friends in one house or another who will be very happy to listen to his case <e> <s> therefore with respect is he not better placed to argue his case in public in the media or through the aid of friends in this house than in the relative quiet of a select committee <e>", "<cs> one reason is that if he has an opportunity before the event there is delay in perhaps an urgent and difficult situation in respect of a functionary the importance of whom for the protection of the public noble lords opposite have spent two days arguing in committee <e> <s> now they are apparently prepared to argue for a period in which the person who is guilty of misbehaviour or incapacity is obviously unable to act because he is awaiting a hearing by a select committee <e> <s> as no one knows better than the noble lord lord bruce of donington the practical reality is this a secretary of state who makes a bloomer and removes a man who is doing a good job in an important office puts his own office on the line <e> <s> no one knows better than the noble lord lord bruce of donington that that is so <e> <s> therefore the great safeguard is not only the fact that the secretary of state will have to answer to parliament after the event but also before the event and before taking a decision the secretary of state has to satisfy himself that what he is doing is right sensible and something he can get away with in parliament <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that is he aware that his amendment does not provide for this to go to a sub-committee but to a committee of this house <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me <e>", "<cs> i am deeply moved by the tribute that the noble lord has paid me because after all no one could speak with greater authority on the subject of holding up business <e>", "<cs> no one could accuse your lordships committee of having

extricate british subjects from the area of radiation earlier than it has proved possible to do now <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether apart from the young offenders whom he mentioned had escaped from the wiltshire centre in the course of those horrible events any other prisoners and if so how many have escaped <e> <s> can he also confirm in the light of the better news that he has given us today whether the normal working of the criminal courts has been resumed <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey because i think that he said that he was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> what he has in mind by the use in that amendment of the word support <e> <s> support apparently is something distinct from training <e> <s> i do not

imprecise expression as i understand it <e> <s> it might possibly be the basis of some abuse <e> <s> at any rate before the committee is asked to decide on this amendment i should like to know how the

very much obliged <e> <s> i take it that my noble friend will make a statement to the house in that event so that all your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged and i share my noble friends hope that it will be before the report stage not least because that would save us a great deal of time during that stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove moves amendments in such a cosy manner that one is almost lulled into a lack of suspicion as to their possible effects <e> <s> i felt myself rather subjected to that process during his short speech <e> <s> on studying the amendments however i am not particularly happy about them <e> <s> they are i understand intended to be the law for some time ahead <e> <s> therefore to confine negotiations for all time as amendment no <e> <s> does to the presently recognised trade unions plainly excludes the possibility of recognising any new union that might come into the field <e> <s> it is an example of the closed shop that i would find some difficulty in accepting <e> <s> it is not after all unknown in industry for new unions to emerge to meet situations <e> <s> it might be almost tactless to remind the noble lord that this is what happened in the mining industry where following recent troubles a new and strongly led union has emerged <e> <s> to freeze for all time negotiating rights to what are deliberately described here as presently recognised trade unions seems a rather dangerous concept <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that it does south africas neighbours no service to equate them with libya <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend invite the attention of the noble lord lord molloy in answer to his question to the occasion in when the labour government so mishandled our affairs it was necessary to bring in the imf to bail us out <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm whether or not the noble lord lord mishcon is right in saying that the commissioner has asked for <e> <s> if that is right what are the governments grounds for refusing that number <e>", "<cs> my lords as he is acting leader of the house can my noble friend indicate whether it is in accordance with the rules and practice of the house to challenge in this way the decision right or wrong of the leader of the house on a private notice question <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us very much welcome the general approach of the white paper and indeed of his own statement <e> <s> the only reservations that some of us have about them is that we should like to see them go a good deal further <e> <s> in particular will my noble friend deal with the point made by the noble baroness lady seear about the still restrictive effects of local planning restrictions <e> <s> will he deal specifically with what in my <e>", "<cs> and my noble friend will hear it again <e>", "<cs> although the noble lord lord carmichael did not say so i take it that he was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> which is the substantive amendment <e> <s> the noble lord did not say that but we should have it on the record <e> <s> in speaking to the amendment i believe that he blurred a little the precise meaning of it <e> <s> he said that it would be useful to have on the board of these companies an individual with experience of the problems of the employees <e> <s> that is indeed such an obvious statement that i do not think one needs to waste any time on it <e> <s> i think your lordships would all agree with that <e>", "<cs> i think that uncharacteristically the noble lord lord willaims of elvel has not thought this out <e> <s> of course he is right in saying that on the board of large companies there are people who are concerned with other interests particularly those of large investors in the company and they can be said colloquially to represent the interests of that company on that board <e> <s> of course that is so <e> <s> but the difference is that here it is proposed that there should be directors with a statutory responsibility for the representation of one particular interest <e> <s> there is no such statutory provision in respect of the kind of representation to which he was referring <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies with respect i should like to remind the noble lord lord underhill that we are not here concerned with whether the transport bill is right or wrong we are concerned with getting this bill right <e> <s> if the noble lord is still convinced of the validity of his amendment he must really go so far as to suggest that in the situation that is contemplated under the clause it would be proper or permissible for directors who are members of the council to take part <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> with great respect i believe it is quite irrelevant as to whether the government have got it right or wrong in a previous bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend made an oblique reference in his remarks a moment ago to the statement which he has promised to make to noble lords about the governments proposals for securing that in the case of the baa control does not pass either to foreign interests or excessively to airline interests <e> <s> i wonder whether he could take that statement a little further <e> <s> it would help some of us if he could give some indication now as to when he is likely to be in a position to make that statement <e> <s> it obviously cannot be before the recess but perhaps he can give us at least some broad indication of when it is likely to be made <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is anything in what my noble friend on the front bench has said that is inconsistent with the suggestion of the noble lord lord underhill that this is a government responsibility <e> <s> but if the government are to exercise that responsibility it seems quite wrong to tie it in advance as to the particular method or indeed particular personnel by which that responsibility might be discharged <e> <s> i would have thought that my noble friend is right to say that he must keep a free hand <e> <s> the government would accept their responsibility but the mechanism or personnel through whom it is discharged are a matter for their decision at the time on the merits of that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says theoretically right <e> <s> which way <e> <s> what i asked was whether the government under this amendment i am not talking about what we come to later are or are not taking power to lay down what slots should be allocated <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn i should like from some past experience of the caa to say to the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> that he need have no apprehensions <e> <s> the caa is regularly in the closest touch with the whole of the industry airline and airports together and takes the closest account of the views of the different sections <e> <s> there is no need for any alarm <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord monkswell i doubt whether local authorities have much of a role to play in deciding the air travellers needs <e> <s> the splendid tourist areas that he mentioned are located at considerable distances from airports <e> <s> the local authorities have little direct knowledge of the air transport industry and i doubt whether they can make much of a contribution from the air travellers point of view <e> <s> the contribution that they can and do make sometimes with great and excessive emphasis concerns the anti-aviation approach of nearby residents complaints about noise and so on <e> <s> i accept completely that it is necessary that they should be consulted but we are deluding ourselves if we think they have any contribution to make from the air travellers point of view <e>", "<cs> i am not at all ambivalent as regards this amendment i am entirely against it <e> <s> with enormous respect to the noble lord lord tordoff it seems to me to exemplify one of the approaches to civil aviation problems which has done and can still do a great deal of harm to one of our most successful and growth-potential industries <e> <s> i appreciate indeed at one time i lived with representations about it the feelings of people living near airports about airport noise and this is a reality which cannot be brushed aside <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me <e> <s> i did not fall into the temptation of suggesting it on this occasion but as he has taken it upon himself to introduce the subject i shall say to him that that would be a sensible thing to do <e>", "<cs> in the free world <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me most of my noble friends are only too anxious that i should not spring to my feet <e> <s> my noble friend lord kinnoull is being very original in suggesting the contrary but on this occasion i am afraid that even his advocacy will not succeed because i do not happen to agree with his amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has raised an interesting issue but i am a little puzzled by the first part of his amendment <e> <s> what <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that air traffic controllers must not be made to work excessive hours <e> <s> the safety aspects of this are too obvious to need stressing <e> <s> those of the committee and i think there are many of them who have been in the control tower either at latcc or at a major airport have been deeply impressed by the way these people handle little dots on a screen moving rapidly and apparently very close together at very high speeds and carrying with them anything up to people in the aircraft they represent <e> <s> this is obviously a most important safety aspect <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will reject this amendment <e> <s> my recollection of the level of charges particularly at the london airports is that they have very often been the subject matter of complaint by foreign as well as british airlines that they were too high <e> <s> it could be very curious i think to come in and insert a minimum <e> <s> in any event in these days when we are still only just succeeding in our battle against inflation the imposition of minimum charges for almost anything seems to be a very questionable idea indeed <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon sought to call me as a witness in support of his proposition <e> <s> i am surprised that someone with his experience as an advocate has not realised the danger of calling a witness without first ascertaining what that witness is likely to say <e> <s> i am afraid that the effort of the noble lord lord stoddart in this respect is an example of that because he was kind enough to say that i have taken a certain part in the discussions on this bill and i had not intended to make any comment on the oppositions behaviour until he provoked me into doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend make it clear that in the unhappy event of an unsatisfactory answer from authorities which are behaving as badly as this his right honourable friend has powers to act or if he has not powers to act will take them <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether any urgent consideration is being given to dealing with this matter at any rate in part through amendment to the public order bill in view of the immense saving of time which would result if it could be dealt with in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me he referred to an answer given in another place but is he aware that my noble friend lord caithness gave an answer in this house on th june on these lines <e> <s> therefore this house is well aware of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage i thought that noble lords opposite were on to a good horse and frankly i was surprised that this bill should have got so far as to reach the committee stage in this house without some step being taken to secure that there was no risk of airports being taken over by some interests who might wish to see those airports run down <e> <s> but with all due respect i think the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove is now flogging a dead horse <e> <s> he was good enough to give way when i ventured to remind him that an answer had been given in this house by my noble friend lord caithness and the noble lord lord carmichael mentioned also an answer given in another place indicating the intention of the government to deal with this point by way of the articles of association of the new company <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he allow me to point out to him that if he is prepared to assume a lunatic secretary of state or a secretary of state completely oblivious to the national interest it would be equally easy to assume a parliament similarly stupid <e> <s> most of us who understand the way our constitution works believe that however much we may differ from policies of secretaries of state it is stretching ones credibility to the limit to believe that you would have a secretary of state who would deliberately agree to amend the article and so let down the operation of airports in this country <e> <s> even if the noble lord is nave enough to believe that he is even more nave if he believes that parliament would let him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that where a minister of the crown in that capacity has answered a question in this house committing the government to certain action it is even conceivable that he should not implement that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord caithness will take this amendment seriously <e> <s> it seems to me to raise a point of considerable importance for the future of our civil aviation industry <e> <s> the bill already provides that the government can give a direction where our international relations are involved and this is of course right <e> <s> but it is silent on the question of what is to happen if the new airport company does not in fact provide adequate accommodation for the british civil aviation industry <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> i was encouraged to hear him say that should the need for additional airport capacity become apparent the secretary of state would take such steps as he could to see that it was provided <e> <s> but under the bill as it stands what power would he have to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friends answer recently provided for him indicate as i understood it to do that while the secretary of state could make encouraging noises and so on he would not actually have any power to make the new authority or the new company set up under this bill create additional capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend make it clear whether the shops allowed to open at airports on sundays despite the collapse of certain other legislation include shops not only on the air side but in all parts of the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may echo the very courteous and very appropriate words that the noble lord lord williams of elvel has spoken and also say as one who has been here through a good deal of these proceedings how much i have admired the courtesy the good temper and the sheer physical stamina which my noble friend has shown in dealing with this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that relations between this country and spain are not helped but are indeed hindered by linking them with a claim to override the wishes of british subjects who so far at any rate have indicated that they desire to remain british <e> <s> will my noble friend advise our spanish friends that pressing that point will do harm and not good <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord another question arising out of his original speech moving this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord used the expression unscrupulous private landlords and suggested that this amendment was directed against such people <e> <s> is it intended that this should apply only to private landlords <e> <s> if a local authority or a housing association or any other owner other than a private landlord allows the equipment to get into bad order and a tragedy results are they not covered by the clause <e> <s> if so why is the noble lord picking solely on private landlords <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this discussion but i wonder why the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon thinks a criminal penalty which sounds rather a powerful weapon though presumably it would be distinctly limited in its impact is more of a deterrent to a landlord <e> <s> i am glad to know he accepts that his clause would bite on public as well as private landlords <e> <s> it is much more of a deterrent to know that if someone is badly injured for example the damages in accordance with present levels of damages awarded by our courts would be enormous <e> <s> we are talking of tens of thousands of pounds and certainly we are talking of amounts far larger than would be imposed by way of criminal penalties <e> <s> i wonder whether perhaps the noble lord does not appreciate that the real deterrent apart from any questions of conscience the real physical deterrent to having defective apparatus of this sort is the risk of having to pay enormous damages <e>", "<cs> this is a very odd amendment indeed <e> <s> it is a matter on which one can speculate as to the motives that lie behind it <e> <s> but taking it first of all as courtesy demands at its face value it is a very odd proposal indeed <e> <s> of course the price of oil at any one time certainly would be a factor in the view which the market would take of the sale of the gas industry <e> <s> but the noble lord lord diamond knows perfectly well that it will be only one factor and that the price which the government would feel able to seek would depend not merely upon the price of oil but on a whole variety of other factors the general state of the market the general state of confidence or lack of confidence in the economy and the competing claims of other considerable financial transactions such as the large takeover activities that are taking place <e> <s> there will be a whole variety of factors of which this is only one <e>", "<cs> surprise surprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very interesting reply <e> <s> is he aware that the former secretary of state justified his decision to overrule the civil aviation authority on the grounds that with the opening of the m there would now be a speedy means of communication between the two airports <e> <s> is my noble friend aware as i sure the secretary of state for transport is aware that that has not turned out to be the case and the m is crowded congested and full of traffic <e> <s> in the light of that and of the very large figure of loss which this decision involves to an industry of great importance to this country will not my noble friend and the new secretary of state reconsider this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that although the decision was taken on the basis of finely balance arguments it now appears that one of the arguments against continuing the licence that the m would have an easy traffic flow has turned out to be unsound <e> <s> is not that ground alone apart from the general opinion of this house sufficient cause for reconsidering the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble and learned lord lord scarman i have great pleasure in beginning by congratulating my two noble friends lord beaverbrook and lord brocket on their immensely impressive and effective maiden speeches <e> <s> i hope that i may be allowed as one who was a great admirer of lord beaverbrooks distinguished grand-father and who had much kindness from him and who was a colleague in another place with my noble friends father to say how pleased i know that those two great men would be if in the workings of providence they could know that their son and grandson was making such an effective entry into the debates of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord identify which is the lion and which is the christian <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about the proposition put forward by the noble baroness is i think that if you set per cent <e> <s> or indeed any other arbitrary figure in the bill as a maximum there is a very considerable risk that it may become a minimum <e> <s> if you contemplate as you would if you put this amendment into the bill that per cent <e> <s> is a reasonable figure it would be extremely difficult for the secretary of state in his supervisory role to take action against people who were in fact charging per cent <e> <s> even though on the merits that was far too high <e> <s> i think it is wiser to leave this to the general supervision of the secretary of state and not to give people a figure which they would feel entitled to go for regardless of the merits <e> <s> i think there are real dangers in that <e>", "<cs> may i put this point to the noble lord <e> <s> if he is right and i hope he is in saying that competition will set the figure in this field then there is absolutely no justification for putting this figure into the bill <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend the minister consciously anticipated the debate on later amendments and if i may say so did so very wisely by making her announcement as to the governments intentions in respect of an amendment to deal with the question of occupational schemes and the so-called bribe at the report stage perhaps i may be allowed briefly to say how much i welcome her announcement <e> <s> it is perfectly true as my noble friend lord vinson said that there has been some exaggeration in the pensions world about the possible effect of this <e> <s> but when all was said and done it appeared that as the bill originated there was a provision that would go against what has been the considered policy in similar legislation for many years of giving direct encouragement to the development of good occupational schemes <e> <s> as i understand my noble friends announcement that threat of possible damage will be removed <e> <s> i should like warmly to express a welcome to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend break it to his right honourable friend that his right honourable friends predecessor was quite wrong in basing an important aviation decision on the theory that there would be a quick and easy flow of traffic between gatwick and heathrow on the m whereas the contrary has been the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who have a share of responsibility for the acceptance of the robbins recommendations have always followed with a measure of anxiety the mounting costs to which the noble lord lord annan referred of higher education in this country and therefore welcome indications of the governments concern in that area too <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches also welcome this thoroughly sensible and wise statement which has just been made <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that on the subject of back payments experience in social administration suggests a good deal of caution as the creation of precedents of always making back payments is apt to inhibit social progress <e> <s> will the government have that in mind <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that some of us are somewhat disturbed that important matters affecting the british social security system should be regarded by the european court as being within its purview <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs moved an important amendment with which as she moved it i am bound to say i felt a measure of sympathy <e> <s> it has been as i think the noble baroness will admit somewhat overshadowed by the major importance of the announcement which the noble baroness lady trumpington has made and which has been welcomed in all quarters of the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock delighted those of us who are keeping a book on the number of occasions that liberal and alliance spokesmen introduce the subject of proportional representation on bills and amendments to which it is wholly irrelevant <e> <s> as i personally am backing the high field i am delighted with the noble lord having introduced this extraordinary idea on this particular bill <e>", "<cs> it is fascinating to see the noble lord seeking to introduce the whole reform of local government through an amendment to the social security bill <e> <s> that itself involves the sort of flexibility which for example mr david owen and mr david steel are showing in other respects in the politics of the alliance <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me is there not also on the question of national taxation the fact that even if a person is taken below the income tax level he still pays a mass of indirect taxation and he knows that when he comes to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment imposes a duty on the civil aviation authority which i think is somewhat misconceived <e> <s> as it stands the bill includes among its duties the need to secure the sound development of civil aviation in the united kingdom <e> <s> as i understand it that means the necessity to provide in this country an efficiently developed civil aviation industry <e> <s> however in the nature of things that industry will not operate throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> it will have to operate in areas to which people wish to fly and therefore in which airlines seek permission to land <e> <s> there are areas in this country where there is no such demand <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept the point that if you are legislating you have to legislate exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord caithness first for the enormous amount of trouble that i know he has personally taken over this matter between the various stages of the bill and then for the new clause and the announcement about the inclusion in the articles of association of the baa <e> <s> all this constitutes a substantial improvement in the bill <e> <s> your lordships house and the civil aviation industry owe this largely to the determined action of my noble friends lord kinnoull and lord dundee who have pursued the matter with great vigour and also great parliamentary skill through various stages of the bill <e> <s> all this undoubtedly amounts to an improvement in the position as compared with the bill as it arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an arguable view <e> <s> for once i find myself not wholly out of sympathy with the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> but at least he is not responsible directly although he was responsible for one of the most foolish decisions that a minister has taken for a long time <e> <s> however this is not a moment to dwell on that it is a moment to thank particularly my noble friend lord caithness for the hard work that he has done <e> <s> i believe from having been fairly close to what has happened that it would not have happened if it had not been for his personal and individual efforts in the department and with his colleagues <e> <s> for that british civil aviation as well as your lordships house should be sincerely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree always unhappily with the noble baroness with whom i agree on so many other things <e> <s> i disagree rather more happily with the noble lord lord underhill but i disagree with both of them on the question of the quality of this bill <e> <s> i think it is a good bill <e> <s> to say that is not to cast any reflection whatever on the british airports authority particularly under its present dynamic chairman or indeed on many of the local <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government find it necessary to pay compensation in respect of scotland cumbria or of wales will they seek reimbursement of the cost of that from the government of the ussr in view of the fact that the whole problem has been created by a failure in the industrial system of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the european court has actually come out with a sensible decision would it not be a good idea to encourage it in that by acting promptly on it <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the general proposition which the noble baroness lady turner made when she said in connection with the case which my noble friend lord vinson so vividly described to us on a previous amendment that if people could run their businesses only by paying sweatshop rates they should close down their business <e> <s> if that is really the policy of the party opposite it is a very revealing observation indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend telling us that the lido will never be reopened <e> <s> if so is he aware that many of us on this side will share the regrets of the noble lord lord underhill at the permanent elimination of what has been quite a feature of london life <e>", "<cs> i am doubtful first of all about the form of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> i have no knowledge of any precedent in any statute but i have not sufficiently examined the mass of legislation which exists on this subject for me to be able to say with any great confidence that there is no such precedent <e> <s> i have often found as i am sure has my noble friend that when one says confidently that there is no precedent for this almost always some noble lord finds one and ones argument is therefore invalidated <e> <s> but for my part i have not <e> <s> if my noble friend whose experience of the law is considerable has not seen it that strengthens my doubts <e>", "<cs> i hope the right reverend prelate will allow me to intervene <e> <s> if he is right on that point then this amendment is wholly unnecessary <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord opposite that i understand his argument perfectly well but surely it is contradictory <e> <s> if the regulations are to define as i think he is suggesting the circumstances in which there should be grants or there should be loans they should do so <e> <s> therefore it is surely wholly unnecessary confusing and misleading to put in before that an amendment saying that normally it shall not mean by loan <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> if the word is normally then we are back to the original point that i made which has not been answered that the officials handling this are given no guidance whatsoever <e> <s> if the regulations were not to use the word normally but to define the circumstances then at least that difficulty would be overcome but simply to say normally is to leave the secretary of state or his officials or probably both in a state of confusion <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount who has just spoken has to some considerable extent undermined the case for this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals was on a very strong point when he mentioned the person who is discharged from a psychiatric hospital because it is quite obvious that if help of this sort is to be given it is required to be given by grant <e> <s> it would be absurd to do it by loan <e>", "<cs> illegal immigrants are another matter <e> <s> i am not sure that an amendment designed to benefit illegal immigrants is particularly attractive to the committee <e> <s> but many legal <e>", "<cs> very successfully <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that that would be an immense improvement to the amendment but whether it is necessary at all to legislate on the point is a matter on which i should like to hear my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will look at amendment no <e> <s> he will see that it refers to grants only <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> as always the noble lord is most courteous <e> <s> given what he said that there will be cases in which a loan would be a perfectly sensible provision and that indeed the man might voluntarily repay it why in his amendment does he limit the provision to grants <e> <s> why not have grants or loans as appropriate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals asked why this should not be accepted <e> <s> there are two circumstances neither very frequent which would make for difficulty if this were enacted and put into the law <e> <s> one is if investigation into the personal circumstances of an applicant were required for the purposes of a ministerial reply in this house or in another place if the case were raised for example by the local member of parliament of the person concerned <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be necessary for the local officer to supply upwards the material required for briefing the minister <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness misunderstood the point that i was trying to make and i am sure that it was my fault <e> <s> what might be revealed in the personal circumstances of an applicant could be plans for the commission of a criminal offence <e> <s> in an extreme case it might be people associated with terrorists in ireland <e> <s> all these things might be revealed <e> <s> it would not be frequent but it <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the amendment refers to the select committees in both houses it is not specific on that point <e> <s> how the system would operate if in either house there were no select committees also raises a considerable doubt <e> <s> the noble lord did not tell us which house of parliaments select committees were to be involved nor did he deal <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us on this side also agree with the noble lord lord underhill in welcoming the governments firmness on the weight of vehicles and axle weight <e> <s> can he confirm because ones own observation does not always appear to confirm this that effective steps are taken at the ports to prevent vehicles which exceed these weights coming into this county from the continent <e> <s> are there really effective steps taken to ascertain the weight of these vehicles and if they are found to exceed it are they sent back <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond seems to have put down this amendment as he has put down a great many others not for any clearly defined purpose <e> <s> he certainly multiplies the proposals that he puts forward no doubt as part of his determination to oppose the government <e> <s> this particular amendment is a very curious one because of its vagueness and imprecision <e> <s> there is nothing whatever in the existing law or in the bill to prevent the secretary of state when making an appointment of this kind from consulting anyone he chooses <e> <s> he may consult people who happen to be members of either house and it would be perfectly proper for him to do so <e> <s> however the amendment would lay on him a statutory duty failure to comply with which would presumably either expose the minister to penalties or give rise to the possibility that the courts might rule that the appointment was irregularly and improperly made <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed the substance of the amendment at considerable length in committee as the noble lord lord diamond admitted <e> <s> i thought that we had sufficient discussion about it <e> <s> it seems rather a pity that we should take up the time of the house to discuss it once again on report <e> <s> the only argument which emerged then and has perhaps emerged now is the sympathy felt by the noble lord lord diamond for the director general for a lone man put up against this enormous industry <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord diamond knows as well as anyone that the director general would not be a lone man <e> <s> he would have a proper staff which included properly qualified assistants <e> <s> some would be of considerable seniority and there would be a proper organisation <e> <s> i hope that on report we shall not feel it necessary to go over again and again this idea of three commissioners <e> <s> as i say we discussed it at considerable length in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that moderately encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether his right honourable friend is aware of the urgency of the matter in view

situation which is likely to arise in the absence of action by the end of the century is not dealt with very quickly it will be too late <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to give any indication at this early stage first as to the likely date of issue of the promised green paper <e> <s> secondly can he indicate the kind of time-scale the government have in mind leading up to their final decisions <e> <s> here i must declare an interest as a director of a company which applied last autumn following the invitation extended by the former home <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take note that the noble lord lord ezra is advocating however obliquely the privatisation of the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very odd amendment indeed because it is surely to be assumed that any secretary of state in any government will act in accordance with what is his view of the national interest <e> <s> i appreciate that noble lords opposite do not feel that the provisions of this bill are in the national interest <e> <s> they have made that abundantly clear and at full length <e> <s> equally as my noble friend behind me has said there are many of us on this side who believe very strongly that this is very much in the national interest <e> <s> but surely to lay down that the secretary of state can act only when it appears to him to be in the national interest is somewhat insulting to any secretary of state <e> <s> for that reason alone i hope that we shall reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is basically the same amendment as the noble lord proposed at some length and in various variants at the committee stage and which he proposed last week during the earlier part of the report stage <e> <s> they all turn on the simple point about which he has convinced himself though on these previous occasions he failed to convince your lordships that the director general would be unable to perform the important duties entrusted to him because he was one man <e> <s> therefore he should be turned from one man into a syndicate <e> <s> whatever merit that argument carries it has been threshed out at really very considerable length and if i may say so with very great respect to the noble lord it seems a little wearisome despite his observations about the guillotine in another place that your lordships should have to consider it now for the third time running <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart said that this was an important amendment and i agree with him <e> <s> it is the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is so anxious because of the few opportunities that he has to speak to speak now then i shall happily give way to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is always anxious to hear the noble lord and i would not wish to stand between him and the house <e> <s> if he wishes to speak now because his name is to the second amendment then i shall be very happy to listen to him <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not necessarily give the house that pleasure too extensively <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> which has been tabled by the noble lord lord diamond seems to me to say in six lines merely what the amendment of the noble lord lord stoddart says in three <e> <s> it is for that reason that i intend to confine my comments to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as i was saying or was about to say when i gave way to the noble lord lord diamond to enable him to speak to his amendment amendment no <e> <s> is an important one <e> <s> i think it is the first important amendment that we have had this afternoon <e> <s> having said that i also suggest that it is a very dangerous one <e> <s> it seems to embody that approach to the management of our national economy which was a characteristic of labour governments on many occasions in recent years <e> <s> it was an approach which suggested that the whole management of our economic activities in this country was best conducted by a wise all-seeing and all-powerful government co-ordinating all these activities and allowing neither those in charge of them nor the consumer to have any particular influence on what happened <e> <s> that of course was the approach adopted by labour governments and your lordships are well aware of the disastrous consequences that occurred when it was put into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i said coal and oil i did not mention electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ezra knows that many british companies in the private sector do show preference to british suppliers <e> <s> in the noble lords previous incarnation and in a previous incarnation of mine he may recall the conjuncture preference was given by a british company to the great organisation of which he was chairman <e> <s> it was not without a certain amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly say to my noble friend the minister that i hope he will accept amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> it seems sensible in the light of his own amendment no <e> <s> that both the secretary of state and the director should have this responsibility whereas in its present form if it is the secretary of state or the director it perhaps leaves in doubt whose duty it would be in any particular case <e> <s> hope therefore that my noble friend will considet accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is significant that the noble viscount referred to the alarm in the electricity industry at the threat of competition from the privatised gas industry <e> <s> one can draw important conclusions from that one of which is that it seems to be appreciated even in a nationalised industry that privatisation will increase the competitive power and efficiency of the industry that is privatised <e> <s> i therefore very much welcome the noble viscount to the ranks of those who favour privatisation <e>", "<cs> i do my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said it my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> however is he aware that there is concern that where someone has <e>", "<cs> my lords when weighing the important points made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones will my noble friend also have very much in mind the danger in the face of the present crime wave of undermining the deterrent effect of sentences imposed by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the new establishment figure is satisfactory to the commissioner or whether he is still asking for more <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not intoler-able that public libraries supported out of public funds should practice censorship of the press in order to support one side of an industrial dispute <e> <s> if the government have not sufficient powers to make the libraries change this practice will they take them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that very interesting reply may i ask whether she will also consider including in the discussions pointing out to the russian minister how difficult friendly relations which we all want with his country are made by the practice of training terrorists whether from libya or the anc or other parts of the world in russia for depredations in other friendly countries <e> <s> will my right honourable and learned friend urge on the russian minister that desisting from this policy would be a major contribution to anglo-russian friendship <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend remind the right reverend prelate with his reference to the decisions of the general synod of the quotation from holy writ to the effect that the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate so far has naturally from a debating point of view centred on the age of as the line of demarcation <e> <s> whether or not that is precisely the right age is a question which <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock put as one of his objections to the bill as it stands what he described as the restriction of local authority discretion <e> <s> but of course he must be aware of the fact that the amendment to which his name has been put also exercises a very considerable restriction on local authority discretion <e> <s> it is quite explicit <e> <s> the amendment begins <e>", "<cs> my lords that has been the view that the house has so far taken <e> <s> it is a view which personally i share <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me that is not proposed in the amendment before the house <e>", "<cs> following on that point may i ask this specific question of my noble friend if this amendment were adopted would a second offence of riot also carry a sentence limited to years <e> <s> your lordships know that there are people in our society who are deeply involved in this kind of thing <e> <s> your lordships could well envisage a case where someone is convicted and sentenced to years imprisonment and thanks to the parole board here i take up the point of the noble baroness he is released well before the end of that years and commits a second offence <e> <s> if this amendment is accepted for the second offence of riot would the court similarly be restricted to the imposition of only years <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord will allow me is he really saying that in the case of a second serious offence of riot he feels that even then the sentence should be years or less <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee is greatly indebted to my noble friend lord colville of culross for eliciting those further remarks from the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> naturally your lordships listen with very great respect i say this most sincerely to anything the noble and learned lord lord scarman says as indeed to what is said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> but certainly both those noble and learned lords left me with an uncertainty which is very much connected with the intervention of my noble friend lord colville of culross <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of pleasure <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to explain the operation of other clauses <e> <s> i shall simply confine myself to the argument which i hope that the noble lord lord grimond will accept that the wapping situation seems to be one to which clause would be highly relevant <e> <s> if that be so and unless it can be established negatively that clause has nothing whatsoever to do with the wapping situation which no one has so far seen fit to argue then the wapping argument is relevant <e> <s> if there are further clauses in the bill that are relevant in this regard as i know there are then so much the better <e> <s> after all such is the main purpose of the bill <e>", "<cs> is not what has been happening in these past few months on the road to wapping exactly what is described in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather sorry that the noble lord lord stoddart in the course of his otherwise good humoured speech cast reflections on the governments motives in respect of the bill <e> <s> on reflection he may feel that that comment was unworthy of him and of his high standards of debate in the house <e> <s> in any event i must ask him to accept just as i accept that he is against the bill for genuine reasons of conviction that there are noble lords on this side of the house as there are honourable members in another place who for reasons of equally honest conviction favour it <e> <s> i do not think that we help the discussion of these matters by imputing motives of one kind or another <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the report to which the noble lord lord underhill has been good enough to invite the attention of the house is a clear indication of the stimulating effect on an organisation of even the prospect of the changes being introduced by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords no government introduce a major measure on social security unless they feel that there is an overwhelming need for so doing because as your lordships will only too well appreciate at this stage major legislation on this subject involves an enormous effort not only for both houses of the legislature but also for ministers and for whitehall <e> <s> this bill whatever view one takes of it and differing views have been expressed is obviously a bill of major importance for our society as a whole and for the vast majority of our population who will be affected by it <e> <s> therefore it is fitting that as we reach this stage of the bill we should reflect for a moment upon its very great importance and the magnitude of the effort involved in bringing it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will very much welcome his announcement of the abolition of recycling <e> <s> it has always seemed to many of us quite illogical that where money is withheld because of overspending it should be redistributed to other local authorities <e> <s> this seems a welcome if belated step <e> <s> will my noble friend also explain particularly to the two noble baronesses who do not appear fully to understand it that local government expenditure on the scale of recent years is of very considerable significance to the management of the national economy for which the national government are responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords at this the final stage of the bill i should like to say a brief word of welcome to it <e> <s> i always enjoy listening to the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton because he always succeeds in putting with great clarity and force views with which i wholly disagree <e> <s> indeed i often feel that he resembles socrates because as your lordships may recall socrates was ultimately charged and condemned to death because of his habit of making the worse appear the better case <e> <s> i sincerely hope that that resemblance will not cause me to have to administer a glass of hemlock and soda to the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton in the guest room <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say whether there is any precedent for this form of words in a statute <e>", "<cs> if i may follow that up with my noble friend would it exclude a document where handwriting was used and here i must declare an interest which is difficult to read <e>", "<cs> i agree wholly with what has just been said about trade union and employee representation but i am less happy about the use of the word sufficient <e> <s> i ask my noble friend who is about to reply whether he will say sufficient for what <e> <s> if one is laying down something in a statute which the courts may have to consider surely the courts should be given some guidance as to what is the purpose sufficiency for which in numbers is required by the clause <e> <s> it is not clear to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting and helpful reply <e> <s> can he say whether in the light of these cracks both the airlines and the government agencies concerned are reviewing the expected working life of these aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a long discussion on this at previous stages of the bill and the issue unlike that on the previous amendment is perfectly clear-cut and simple <e> <s> i therefore do not propose to take up more than a moment of your lordships time <e>", "<cs> my lords from the serenity of my noble friends official car has he been able to observe the deterioration in services on the district line particularly in respect of breakdowns of trains and escalators <e>", "<cs> my lords was it not only the activity of the then lord elgin which caused the marbles still to be in existence and had it been left to the greeks would they not have been destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for what is at any rate a quantitatively satisfactory reply may i ask him how he works out that an increase of lp on p mail is below the rate of inflation <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that lesser mathematical minds than his would suggest that it is about per cent <e> <s> against the current rate of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figures which he gave for deliveries are somewhat misleading inasmuch as they relate not as he said to the time of posting but to the time of collection which is of course at the discretion of the post office <e> <s> in the light of that fact are not his figures just as misleading on that point as his strange calculation that lp on p is less than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the calm good sense of her original statement does not to many of us seem to merit the highly critical comments which it received from the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> is she also aware that it seems to many of us thoroughly sensible not to indicate in advance of the meeting with the commonwealth heads of government at the weekend and in advance of discussions with them exactly how her majestys government are contemplating proceeding <e> <s> is not the purpose to have a discussion with them and to see whether a meeting of minds can be achieved among those who are very largely concerned <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord on the front bench opposite that in dealing with these difficult and sensitive situations it is highly desirable that the police officer concerned should be as senior as possible <e> <s> i do not think that any member of the committee would have difficulty in accepting that view <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington was quite right when he said that this was an important amendment <e> <s> personally i regard it as a very important one because if the committee were to accept it it would drive quite a large hole into the structure of the bill <e> <s> that no doubt is its purpose <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome this amendment which as my noble friend the minister told us is designed to deal with a particularly unpleasant modern type of crime <e> <s> the only doubts that seem to have been expressed are as to the appropriateness of including the measures in this bill <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford is the first speaker in this lengthy debate to argue that the present civil law is adequate to deal with the situation <e> <s> quite apart from the fact that the events of last summer convinced most of us that that is not the case it seems to me that the whole of the noble lords argument about obtaining an injunction and so on is wholly unrealistic when one looks at the actual facts of the matter <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord gifford therefore deal with this question <e> <s> how does the farmer perform this simple act on a saturday afternoon <e>", "<cs> for once and it is a very rare occasion the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is on a bad constitutional point <e> <s> if the noble lord is right your lordships house is not entitled to legislate on practically any matter which has financial consequences <e> <s> if that rule were to be established the next few weeks in this house would admittedly be very much easier for your lordships individually but we should be emasculating the legislative power of this house to an unacceptable degree <e> <s> therefore despite what the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby said i hope the committee will be prepared to consider this amendment on its merits <e>", "<cs> i referred to inheritance tax only in regard to the broad aspect of the matter that the government favour home ownership <e> <s> i ventured to suggest to my noble friend that if the government favour the encouragement of home ownership another and effective way of doing so would be for the chancellor of the exchequer to be persuaded to act as i suggested <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby with his habitual honesty and frankness has removed the veil of discretion which the noble baroness tried to draw over the opposition benches this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord made it perfectly clear honestly clear that he does not like owner-purchase of council housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think that the considerations which she has adduced for the withdrawal of a guard which has been there for years apply with absolute equality to the spanish guard <e> <s> would it not have been more sensible to have made sure that if these guards were to be withdrawn they should be withdrawn simultaneously <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend if the spanish government persist in maintaining the guard indicate to them that if they do not accept the considerations of european unity which were referred to so eloquently we shall find it necessary to restore our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this case and the concern which it caused as he knows for the learned judge who tried the subsequent murder case indicates the heavy responsibility that lies on the shoulders of those who release dangerous men on parole <e> <s> has any action been taken in respect of whoever did this <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to this case is my noble friend satisfied that those responsible for the decision in respect of this obviously dangerous man which is a decision that has cost the life of an innocent man was properly taken <e> <s> in particular has he not just told your lordships that a psychiatric report was apparently not even available <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised to find this amendment coming from the other side of the committee <e> <s> on bill after bill over the last few years we have had moans and protests from noble lords and noble baronesses opposite that the government were taking away the discretion of local authorities were taking away their authority were overriding them and taking away their functions <e> <s> now when the government propose to leave the important function of entry on their housing lists to local authorities up gets the noble baroness and up get noble lords opposite to say that they must be restricted <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to reply since the noble lord opposite challenged me <e> <s> the noble lord lord elystan-morgan very uncharacteristically for him if i may say so missed the point <e> <s> the point is not whether or not local authority housing should be allocated according to need that parliament has laid down <e> <s> the point that arises on this amendment is who is to be the judge of that need <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the need for building land outside the green belt areas which is accentuated by the increased size of those areas can my noble friend do something to speed up local planning committees in dealing with applications <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will not accept this amendment which would be extremely restrictive in respect of the introduction of simplified planning zones <e> <s> as i understand the clause it puts on the local planning authority responsibility for considering the introduction of an spz <e>", "<cs> i should like to give a warm welcome to this clause and to the purpose behind it <e> <s> those who like myself in the past have had some association with the problems of development know what a handicap to developers our planning system in this country can sometimes be not least because of the sheer delay inherent in the system a delay derived sometimes from the rather bureaucratic activities of the planning officials of local authorities and sometimes from the extraordinary infrequency of the meetings of planning committees <e> <s> anything that can speed up that process must surely be in the national interest from two points of view <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e> <s> i spelt out conservative with a small c <e> <s> i hope the noble lord heard that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may mention a point relating to that raised by the noble baroness opposite <e> <s> why does the amendment say an authority who rather than an authority which <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of a personal view it is a question of the drafting of a statute <e> <s> who is used generally in respect of persons <e> <s> i say the noble lord who is conducting these proceedings with such skill but i would refer to the government which is conducting them with equal skill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the lord chairman able to say whether there is any connection between this motion and the long list of petitions which have been withdrawn against the bill and which appear on the front page of todays minutes of proceedings <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord able to say whether this is a very unusual procedure or is it one frequently adopted <e>", "<cs> as one who i am afraid became rather a bore to your lordships on the kitchens point earlier i must express my gratitude to her majestys government for dealing in this bill with that issue in clause <e> <s> i am sure that the committee universally welcome that though it took a good deal of pushing from all sides of the house as it then was to induce this happy change <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady trumpington puts those of us who see considerable merit in this amendment in something of a difficulty <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals said a moment or two ago the only real argument was not directed to the merits of the proposal but like the argument of the noble and learned lord lord denning was directed to whether this was the right vehicle <e> <s> i think my memory is fairly accurate my noble friend said something about this not being the occasion and not the vehicle <e> <s> any view supported by the noble and learned lord is entitled to very great respect and certainly it receives that respect from me <e> <s> but for the argument of my noble friend to have convincing effect certainly on those of us who see the merits of this proposal there would have to be some indication that if this is the wrong vehicle or the wrong time the government have in mind proposals for doing this or something like it in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> the last two speeches have been intensely interesting <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and to i was about to say my noble friend because in everything except the technical sense he is the noble lord lord harris of high cross neither of their speeches bears on the issue which in a few moments the committee will have to decide <e> <s> both speeches appeared to ignore the practical legislative realities of the position in which we now are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that modestly hopeful reply <e> <s> may i ask whether the government will among other things consider the possibility of operating the helicopter service at a somewhat higher altitude than previously thus mitigating the alleged nuisance of noise on the ground <e> <s> as regard the coaches will my noble friend and his right honourable friend consider operating them airside to airside that is from one aircraft direct to another and in that way cut out the need for passengers to go through customs and immigration twice <e>", "<cs> my lords are not those who take it upon themselves to organise these nightly riots with the consequences about which my noble friend has told us guilty of a number of offences and is it contemplated that proceedings should be taken against them <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the statement made by the noble lord lord avebury quoting mr gandhi to the effect that the introduction by this country of visa requirements was racist a little odd in view of the fact that india insists on visas for british subjects proceeding to india <e> <s> is it not a case of sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander <e> <s> will my noble friend clear up two points <e> <s> is it not the fact that airlines which bring into this country people who have no authority to enter are themselves responsible at their own expense for taking them home <e> <s> secondly in view of what my noble friend said about those who absconded when placed in hotels will he say what precautions are taken when immigrants whose status is doubtful are placed in hotels <e> <s> what steps are taken to secure that they do not simply walk out <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend deal with the point that i raised about the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not an interesting commentary on the contrast between our society and that of the communist world that we have to take steps to keep people out whereas it expends great energy on keeping people in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elystan-morgan founded the startling argument that because the schedule as it stands if complied with will involve some public expenditure it is a rather good thing to add more by way of the amendment <e> <s> that is absolutely characteristic of the attitude of the party opposite to public expenditure <e> <s> i am sure that we are much indebted to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan for displaying that with his characteristic honesty and frankness <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of my noble friends last few sentences can she bring out that any attempt to link social security benefits with wage levels would undoubtedly be frustrated by the substantial increases in wage rates taking place at the moment <e> <s> can she with all the authority of her office emphasise that those who push these substantial demands are jeopardising the position of those who depend on social security <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of the disposal of these buildings in the interests of the london ratepayers because of their very manifest value can my noble friend say whether lambeth council is being helpful over the planning aspects and whether ilea is being helpful over expediting its much-wanted departure <e>", "<cs> my lords surely nothing could be more appropriately judicial and balanced than the double negative of saying that one does not disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the introduction of the scottish comparison is largely a red herring <e>

many respects from the law of england <e> <s> if i may call to mind a recent example in another place it was decided that the law of england should remain different from the law of scotland with respect to the opening of shops on sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that among the so-called conventional weapons of the soviet union which have to be linked for purposes of a nuclear agreement there was included their massive development in respect of chemical warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws the amendment perhaps i may express slight concern about the clause <e> <s> i am not sure what the amendment does to it whether it strengthens it or weakens it <e> <s> i should perhaps declare an interest <e> <s> i am on a board of a company that owns a number of theatres including about half of those in the west end and i should declare that <e> <s> it seems to me that this clause could inhibit the production of some of the most famous plays in

jenkins as he referred me to the debate of two days ago <e> <s> i do not think that he can rely on that as being a justification in itself particularly in the light of what was then said for the points i have put <e> <s> it seems to me that this clause has dangers in it <e> <s> there is also the peculiar point that as i understand it it is to be beamed only on the performing threatre while excluding broadcasting <e> <s> we are entitled to a little more explanation than merely if the minister will allow me to say so a rather off-the-cuff reference to a previous debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the offence in question is a new and singularly unpleasant one as i think everyone agrees <e> <s> it is a dangerous offence and an offence whose motivation seems to be an attempt to intimidate society for one reason or another <e> <s> in those circumstances it is appropriate not merely to consider the level of sentence as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has done in relation to other offences but also to look at it in the context of the importance of parliament marking its view regarding the seriousness of the offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with the noble lord lord mishcon who in his usual witty way made some fun of the clause and pointed out perfectly properly that as it stands you can put vehicles in one field and vehicles in an adjoining field belonging to another farmer therefore mobilising if my mathematics are right a total of vehicles for the operation and you are perfectly all right whereas if you put vehicles into one field you are caught by the clause <e> <s> i wholly agree with the noble lord that the clause as it stands looks very odd <e> <s> i also think it looks odd

from the other side of the house about this action will my noble friend bring out even more clearly that the government in this action have been paying full attention to the recommendations of the public accounts committee in another place and that that body i speak as a former chairman of it is perhaps the most respected of all select committees in another place and is presided over at the moment by a very distinguished member of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friends reference to the review of arms sales from the community to syria being reviewed on th november

local authority would involve that local authority in considerable expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be almost impertinent for a church warden to venture to congratulate a bishop on his speech

incident has been made by the principal or by the college <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people outside and many people inside this house will feel that the improvements in

haringey say frankly that burnham must go and equally conditions <e> <s> i understood the noble lord to say that but of course he can deny it if he wishes <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to have that further emphasis but i do not understand why it was necessary for the noble lord to intervene <e> <s> we have also had from him i do not know whether he wishes to intervene again an acceptance that pay and conditions of service should be negotiated together <e> <s> we have therefore got a considerable measure of agreement and the atmosphere in that respect this afternoon as i see it is a little less contentious than it was on second reading <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord appreciate that there is all the difference in the world between the secretary of state being advised by an advisory council whose views he may or may not fully or in part accept and putting the secretary of state at the end of a long chain of negotiation faced <e>", "<cs> he said it again today <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend in reading the statement referred to the organisers of this matter <e> <s> given the experience of the past year and given the legal presumption that a sane man is deemed to contemplate the natural consequences of his acts will my noble friend consider consulting the law officers of the crown to see whether criminal proceedings can and should be brought against those who

i made no statement as has been attributed to me quite inaccurately by the noble baroness <e> <s> i asked a question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord rochester seems to have ignored in moving this amendment the discussion which we had at considerable length on the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on the point that it is unwise to try to rush a permanent and final arrangement by way of amendment at the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> i think a good many of your lordships on the previous occasion took the view that the government were right to go as the bill does for an interim solution during which a sensible and permanent system could be worked out in discussion with all concerned <e> <s> however this amendment if adopted excludes that and produces a new system intended no doubt to be permanent <e>", "<cs> it is apparently intended that it should be as my noble friend lord renton says a statutory provision <e> <s> perhaps either the noble lord lord mcintosh or the noble lord on the liberal benches could tell me who is a suitable statutory representative of parents <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord tell the committee what percentage of the parents in this country that rather aggressive body represents <e>", "<cs> this is a quite substantial amendment because it would deprive the secretary of state of the possibility of referring to the advisory committee any matter which had been agreed between organisations representing teachers and local authorities <e> <s> it is precisely in that kind of situation that before making up his mind what he is going to do the secretary of state might well wish to have the views of the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord lord mcintosh explain certainly to me and perhaps to other members of the committee whether the right to make representations or to submit evidence means oral evidence or oral representations or whether the requirement would be satisfied by the submission of written documents <e> <s> i shall be interested to know that because i think it has some bearing on the amendments degree of acceptability <e>", "<cs> this is substantially the same point that the committee discussed a little time ago on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh accepted and most of us accept that it is a good thing if teachers organisations and local authority organisations negotiate <e> <s> indeed he read out the part of the amendment which relates to that aspect <e> <s> but he did not read out and i make no complaint of this the crucial words at the end <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord wish me to answer that question <e> <s> i can do so at some length if necessary <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee at this late hour but it seems to be a very unattractive procedure that is followed in this case and one apt to give rise to difficulty <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me see why it should not be possible for details of the teachers salary scales and arrangements if they are complex and massive to be attached as a schedule to the order <e> <s> we are playing a little superficially with the serious process of legislation if subordinate legislation does not contain the substance of what it is trying to do and this is embodied in some other document distinct altogether from a legislative document simply published by the stationery office <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for saying that <e> <s> i think it is a bad way to legislate and perhaps in particular she and her right honourable friend will consider the alternative of simply scheduling the detailed document to the order <e>", "<cs> as i said last night i have great sympathy with most of the views of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton who in another capacity guided noble lords with such skill and judgment over a great many years <e> <s> but i am sorry to say that on this occasion in respect of this amendment i cannot support him <e> <s> we are dealing only with a very short-term question the time between now and st october and the practical point which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has ducked is the question of timing <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord has concluded would he address his mind to this point <e> <s> he put some weight on both houses or either house of parliament debating the matter and thought that that might reassure the teachers <e> <s> can he tell the committee what is to prevent us using the negative procedure a prayer being put down for annulment in either house so facilitating that discussion but without the delay involved in the affirmative procedure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is good enough to say that there is no substance in my point <e> <s> will he now condescend to answer the question that i put to him at the end of his earlier speech which he conspicuously did not answer <e> <s> why cannot his belief which is a quite reasonable one that teachers may wish to have some discussion in parliament on this matter be adequately met on the negative procedure by way of prayers in both houses <e> <s> although the noble lord lord houghton is right that in another place that could only be two hours in your lordships happier house it can take a very long time indeed <e> <s> why is that not adequate <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord really believe that there would not be a prayer <e> <s> would he not put one down himself <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord indicate whether he is taking a number of amendments together and if so which ones <e>", "<cs> i can agree for once with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey in his comment that the noble lord lord henderson of brompton moved this complicated group of amendments with the moderation and clarity that one would expect from him <e> <s> i can sympathise too with the noble lord lord mcintosh in his scepticism about anything being provisional or temporary <e> <s> the french as he may recall have a very good summing up of it <e>", "<cs> before the committee comes to a decision i should point out that the committee is being asked to make something of a nonsense <e> <s> a few moments ago the committee accepted the amendment of the noble baroness lady seear under which the bill can be continued after the three years by affirmative resolution <e> <s> that was the decision of the committee and it stands as the decision of the committee at this stage of the bill <e> <s> a few minutes later the committee is being asked completely to contradict that and to say that it cannot be continued at all after three years <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of our having had a debate to consider options it is a question of a committee of the house of lords as a part of the legislature putting a provision into a bill <e> <s> the committee unanimously as i understand it put in the provision and it is now being asked to contradict that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in contrast to the somewhat grudging response of the noble lord lord dean of beswick there are many of us who welcome enormously this carefully worked out detailed and very important scheme which he has announced and which despite his modest rejection of the suggestion many of us know owes a great deal to his own personal intervention care and experience <e> <s> is my noble friend aware i am sure he is that those of us who have some experience in industry know that one of the problems is the lack of availability of sufficiently trained labour to fill vacancies and that the unemployment figures are inflated as a result of that <e> <s> is he aware that it seems clear from his statement that that problem will be very substantially dealt with in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not find it a little odd as the learned judge who tried the case found that a man should be released from prison within a year of his having absconded from a previous grant of parole <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that the decision to release him resulted in the commission of further offences considerable wrongs being done to several members of the public and very considerable police effort <e> <s> is it not curious that the previous absconding should be completely ignored in a decision to release the prisoner on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords is any administrative system not improved by the knowledge that if errors are made as they were in this case they will have attention drawn to them <e> <s> is it not a fact that this particular man was not due for final release until spring <e> <s> so it was somewhat premature to regard this release on which he committed these offences against two innocent girls as having anything to do with preparation for final release <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say having said that the situation cannot be tolerated whether the government are contemplating introducing more effective sanctions against local authorities which defy the law <e>", "<cs> i was glad to hear my noble friend give that answer because i must confess that i was somewhat disquieted by the observations of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i discount the fact that he is the best debater in this place and could easily make a poor case sound splendid <e> <s> the noble lord made a significant point particularly in view of the delays in magistrates courts which he cited and which my noble friend did not contradict during which of course <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i always enjoy listening to the noble earl who has just resumed his seat and i always regret having to follow him because i enjoy his speeches so much that i find it astonishingly difficult to disagree with anything that he has said <e> <s> however i am relieved of that difficulty in respect of the noble baroness lady david on the front bench opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just finish that reference and then i shall happily give way <e> <s> i would wish only to make one exception which will not wholly surprise the noble lord <e> <s> i refer to his concluding paragraph <e> <s> on the other hand i can tell him that i am rather happy about it because i have a longstanding bet with one of my colleagues that noble lords who speak from those benches will drag in proportional representation on any subject you like and the noble lords concluding observations have put me one up on that bet <e> <s> now i shall give way to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not imagine that those are very unusual sentiments <e> <s> it is on the whole unlikely i put it no higher that the noble baroness would have said in terms that those on her bench were in favour of waste however much the practical record of their party in government may contradict that <e> <s> but one does not expect even so frank a person as the noble baroness actually to come to the dispatch box and admit it <e> <s> but i shall follow up a little what she has just been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give way as often as the noble baroness likes <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the noble baroness said that there were reasons for the waste and the unnecessary spending <e> <s> i quite agree <e> <s> but what the noble baroness did not do and this is the point that i am coming to was to have in mind what the audit commission said on page of its report <e> <s> the eight boroughs are listed in group a they are compared in their expenditure per head of the population and in the number of staff they employ in relation to population with those in group b eight boroughs also in london <e> <s> therefore the attempt to defend which when the noble baroness looks at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may have said that but the audit commission said the contrary <e> <s> i think that most of your lordships will be more inclined to pay attention to the careful studies made by the audit commission in its carefully reasoned report than to the mere assertion of the noble baroness at the dispatch box <e> <s> the audit commission goes on its way to point out that the boroughs in group b have problems similar to those in group a but the noble baroness appears entirely to have ignored that <e> <s> when she studies her speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords i will give way in a moment <e> <s> i have a little list as someone once said in an opera and perhaps the noble lords intervention will be even more effective if i complete the list before giving way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord were himself responsible for a business in which i was a shareholder is he telling me that he would look round the country when deciding where to locate his premises and would then deliberately choose to locate the business in an area of high and rising rates <e> <s> will the noble lord tell me that <e>", "<cs> my lords that intervention has not strengthened my enthusiasm for the intelligent management of the co-operative movement <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be quite obvious and i have a certain amount of industrial and commercial experience that if you are free to choose a location for your premises you will first of all consider the level of rates in respect of which you will have no vote whatever in local elections <e> <s> also i do not know whether the study mentioned by the noble lord goes as far as this you will look into the future <e> <s> if you go to an area which has been borrowing heavily as these local authorities we are discussing have been doing and building up large accumulations of money that has to be repaid in coming years you will know that you are sticking your neck into a rate trap <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to say that the whole complaint during mondays debate was that people were not bringing their businesses to those areas where people were suffering but were concentrating them in the areas like the so-called m valley <e> <s> if the noble lord will study the matter a little more carefully he will see that one of the discouragements and it is only one because there are many others if you are starting afresh and have no particular local connections to bringing your business into those areas is the simple calculation that you are going to pay high rates already and you will certainly have to pay more next year because that local authority has been borrowing and some time it will have to pay the money back <e>", "<cs> my lords given my noble friends first answer that the capacity is adequate only until and given the time which as he knows is required from the initiation of an airport scheme to the opening of the airport is it not high time whatever recommendations the government were to receive from elsewhere that the government themselves were taking decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the question of the noble lord lord bruce of donington is not the obvious answer to nationalise the production of this product and thereby diminish it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey admitted in his usual agreeable way that this series of amendments would start a debate which was to some extent a <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord has taken the point that i sought to make and no doubt that is my fault <e> <s> my point is that no attempt is made in this series of amendments to produce a coherent and complete bill if they are <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord explain from the point of view of the ordinary child the difference beween chaos in the school and disruption in the school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord yet again but as he has referred to me and quoted my words he will no doubt be aware that i went out of my way to explain i hope very fully that under the bill as it stands there is the perfect possibility of negotiation between the employers and the teachers unions <e> <s> to attribute to me any desire to abolish that is completely unwarrantable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson of brompton sought very properly to establish his doctrinal impartiality on this matter by pointing out that he had supported the bill at earlier stages <e> <s> but of course as he did not mention the same is not quite true of the bearer of the second name on his amendment whose unaccustomed silence has perhaps almost a sinister ring to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson suggested that i was fanciful <e> <s> this matter has been under discussion for between two and three years already <e> <s> the powers of delay of some of the parties concerned are very considerable <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the government of the day could legislate before the three years elapsed but having observed as the noble lord no doubt has the time which this legislation has taken it is clear that if it were apparent that agreement was not going to be reached inside the three years the legislation would have to be promoted very substantially before the end of the three years in order to make sure there was some legal structure in force when the bill lapsed as it would under the noble lords amendment <e> <s> one is therefore not going to have three years one is going to have at the outside two and a half years <e>", "<cs> my lords would not this same argument apply to the situation in which in order to preserve some stability some government would have to introduce an affirmative resolution to continue the bill <e> <s> does not exactly the same argument apply <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that one of the major difficulties facing those who want to bring forward developments of one kind or another is the extraordinary slowness and dilatoriness of local authorities planning procedures <e> <s> can he say whether the circular does anything to tell them to improve this <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wanted to add to what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said that the noble earls bill plainly represents the considered view after full discussion of a large number of your lordships <e> <s> i hope that the noble baronesss right honourable friend will take that into account when considering what further action may be necessary in another place <e> <s> there is strong feeling about this matter <e> <s> many people will be sad to see the noble earls gallant initiative frustrated <e> <s> many of us hope that the government will handle the matter in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no objection whatever if the noble baroness sends a copy of the letter sent to me to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> if it is so sent the noble lord will see that it does not wholly answer the difficulty raised at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i think that i raised it among others <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> i assist only by saying that the information with great respect to the noble baroness is not of the high value that the noble lord seems to attribute to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a little difficult to understand exactly what this amendment means particularly with reference to the position of the government <e> <s> as your lordships know central government find or per cent <e> <s> of the costs of the remuneration of teachers <e> <s> there is no specific <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave the noble lord quite rightly said that the amendment lays on the secretary of state the duty of bringing forward proposals but it lays down what they shall be <e> <s> they are proposals which leave no room whatever for determination by the central government <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord referred to me may i ask him to look at his own amendment and see that it specifically and definitely provides for <e>", "<cs> my lords that brings us back to the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> regarding that matter i should like to ask my noble friend a question which as i understand it has already been ventilated at the other end of the corridor <e> <s> it has been mentioned several times today that two of the teachers unions predictably the two which are affiliated to the tuc have announced that they proposed to ballot their members on the question whether or not to organise disruption or some form of strike action <e> <s> the point has been raised at the other end of the corridor and i do not think it should be passed <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend explain a little more fully what is the difficulty in drafting a clause to prohibit political propaganda on the rates <e> <s> surely all the preliminary work has already been done by widdicombe <e> <s> it is somewhat difficult to follow why based on that research a clause to do that cannot be inserted in the bill <e> <s> may i further ask my noble friend whether if i

amendment deals not with the failure of a local authority to collect money lawfully due to it but with the deliberate freeing of certain categories from making a contribution and poses the question of who pays <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble lords parliamentary agility in raising a point in which he is interested on this amendment <e> <s> i was merely pointing out to him that if there is a problem here and there may well be it is not one which would be remedied even if the amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> before that happens i should like to add a word <e> <s> i certainly could not support the amendment because among other things it contains the provision that any loss to the local authority must be compensated by the taxpayer <e> <s> we dealt with that matter on a previous amendment <e> <s> on the other hand i should not like to leave my noble friend with the feeling that i am at all happy with the position as it stands <e> <s> i wonder whether he can give a little further consideration to the position of people in the national services <e> <s> they may be posted from england to scotland or from scotland to england <e> <s> they will find in different local

have just spoken <e> <s> the bill reads very oddly <e> <s> there is nothing in clause which specifies what it deals with <e> <s> however when one looks at the side note it indicates that it relates to

like shall be spelt out in detail in the bill or whether these are considerations which the minister should be asked to take into account in the making of regulations <e> <s> that seems to be the conflict that arises between the two points of view expressed in the chamber this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt what my noble friends response to this amendment will be <e> <s> i am quite sure

example of the fact that hating the bill as he does he is prepared to take every point that he thinks he can against it regardless of whether those points are consistent with one another <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords can say no but let us take my example which is a common one of similar houses occupied in one case by a widow who has suffered the misfortune of her husband dying and her children gone paying the same rates as the household next door which has four or five earners <e> <s> if noble lords think that is fair i can only say that their idea of fairness is odd and it does not appeal

enacted is the worst of all propositions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i agree with him that the subject would be much more appropriate to a later amendment <e> <s> i

understand my noble friends argument which is undoubtedly valid in the case of a single offence of a relatively trivial kind <e> <s> however as i read the amendment it does not deal with the case and

public demand for keeping that person off the road for a number of years <e>", "<cs> surely as my noble friend has admitted that there is already a mandatory penalty available for this offence he cannot use the argument against mandatory penalties as an argument against this amendment <e> <s> it is a matter of judgment at what level the minimum mandatory penalty should be fixed <e> <s> i should have thought that public opinion generally holds and i hope many members of the committee would support it that a minimum of three years for an offence where by the seriousness of the reckless

saying that the bill seeks to put the wishes of whitehall on top of those of local authorities <e> <s> it is not whitehall that is enacting this it is parliament elected by all the people <e> <s> it is parliament the other place elected by all the people that has sent this bill to your lordships house <e> <s> no doubt it is good to stir up prejudice by talking about whitehall because it is very easy to laugh at bureaucracy <e> <s> i agree that sometimes it is no laughing matter <e> <s> but to do so is quite misleading <e> <s> when there are real abuses of this kind it is the duty of parliament to seek to deal with them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord defend those who put forward plans of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that <e> <s> he has also said that he will vote against the clause <e> <s> therefore there will be no legal sanction to prevent this kind of action being repeated in this borough and several of the other boroughs <e> <s> brent has authorised a display of gay books <e> <s> among the books is <e>", "<cs> it is all very well for the right reverend prelate to say that <e> <s> i have quoted several examples where whatever the parents reaction has been it has happened <e> <s> therefore it is sheer wishful thinking on the part of the right reverend prelate to imagine that it can be prevented by anything except legislation <e> <s> i am surprised and sorry that he does not take on this matter the more robust attitude in respect of clergy that has been recently taken by his brother the bishop of ripon who has been quite emphatic and clear on the ordination of practising homosexual clergy <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to know that the right reverend prelate supports that <e> <s> he did not go out of his way to say so in his speech <e>", "<cs> of course promotion can be treated in different ways <e> <s> if the clause becomes law it will be a matter for the courts to interpret in the sensible way in which the courts do interpret the law <e> <s> the fact that legislation always presents difficulties the noble lord knows that as well as i do is surely no reason why the legislature should refrain from legislating when there is a real evil as he admits there is and which as i have already suggested to the right reverend prelate cannot be dealt with other than by legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the immense importance and almost equal complexity of the statement will my noble friend arrange for an early debate in your lordships house upon it it being particularly a matter on which so many noble lords have valuable views and information to contribute <e> <s> my noble friend is hesitating to give an answer so i invite his attention to the convenient adjacency to him of the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend say that his answer to the noble lord lord williams of elvel means that the government do not regard it as a necessary condition of concluding the agreement that there should be equalisation of indirect taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend answers that question perhaps he will also answer this <e> <s> this is a government motion not a motion in the name of a back-bench peer <e> <s> can he tell noble lords whether this is the first occasion on which the time limited debate procedure has been applied to a government motion and whether this is intended to set a precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people very much resent the suggestion made by the noble lord opposite that the figures have been fiddled as both an unjustified reflection on ministers and a yet more unjustified reflection on our wholly impartial and honourable civil service <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the noble and learned lord lord denning that this somewhat complicated amendment would leave the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with quite considerable difficulties of selection and if i may say so with respect a rather odd collection of people <e>", "<cs> as my noble and learned friend lord hailsham suggests they are either those who committed serious crimes and who we know as a result of the activities of the parole board will soon be at liberty and therefore available for appointment to this board or if it refers to the legal aid scheme in particular as the great volume of the work done is as i understand it divorce the person presumably most qualified would be the member of the public who had had the most divorces <e> <s> that is not perhaps a proposal which would appeal to the right reverend prelates on the bishops bench <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the amendment is largely an organised or perhaps a disorganised nonsense and i hope my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor with his habitual courtesy will dismiss it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend add to that compendious list and answer this simple question <e> <s> is an obligation included to give notice to owners of adjoining property particularly in the case of aerial crop spraying <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend add to the interesting information that he has given the house the numbers currently involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the capacity of the community to sustain the massive costs of the national health service dependent upon the health of the economy and is that not also a matter to which his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer must give the closest attention if we are to continue our ability to sustain those burdens <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that the learned judge stated in open court that he had communicated with the home secretary and if the home secretary has lost his letter will be make inquiries so that the matter can be looked into <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that this is a serious matter in respect of which the police federation has expressed deep concern <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is a rather odd aspect of parliamentary procedure to refer to a chipping away at an institution when a question is raised which has aroused general public interest <e> <s> is he aware that the gibe of chipping away however amiably intentioned is not likely to discourage any noble lord from doing his duty in raising matters of public concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer and the for the implication that the cost of what is suggested in my question would be less than the figure he named <e> <s> is he aware that a concession is already made in respect of capital gains tax on a persons home and that an extension of this would carry the governments policy of making us a home-owning democracy further into another generation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the inland revenue could easily cope with that comparatively easy gambit by imposing a time limit <e> <s> is he also aware that the present high price of houses has the effect of pushing into inheritance tax people who have very few other means but whose houses have become highly rated <e> <s> will he express rather more sympathy than the noble lord lord bruce with the families turned out of a home which they had hoped would continue to be theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> does his reference to the liability to be checked mean that in practice all vehicles go over weighbridges <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the damage done to motorways and the road safety aspect can my noble friend say whether it is the intention and object of the government to ensure that all incoming vehicles are weighed and that we do not rely on the fallacious method of trying to guess a vehicles weight by looking at it <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who goes regularly to australia and claims to know the country well perhaps i may add just one word of additional congratulation to the australian people on the successful achievement of the past years <e> <s> australia as your lordships know is a country with wonderful natural resources full of active energetic dynamic and efficient people <e> <s> i am quite sure that the century which is now opening will show even greater achievements <e> <s> indeed when your lordships come to the tercentenary celebrations australia will undoubtedly then be one of the great powers of the world <e> <s> we wish it well <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering this application will my noble friend and his right honourable friend have in mind that this organisation consists of highly responsible people whose views could be of great assistance to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first follow up what has been said by the noble lord lord swann who as your lordships know speaks on <e>", "<cs> i am glad for once that i carry the noble lord lord ennals with me <e> <s> the shock to my system is almost overwhelming and conjures up the idea in my mind that i may well be wrong <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect i do not think the noble lord has really got the point when he talks about cash limiting hardship <e> <s> i know he is talking about the social fund <e> <s> but there is no reason whatever to believe that the operation of that fund with the alleviations and the concessions which have already been mentioned is going to cash limit hardship <e> <s> it may well be sensible to have in mind in dealing with these matters some idea of what the figure is going to be <e> <s> it is foolish to go in for an acceptance of unlimited liabilities without any understanding of how the funds are to be obtained <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord i do not believe that his intervention really takes the matter or his case any further <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it has been stated that yts will cover all those who desire to take part in it therefore the only fit people who would be left drawing benefit would be voluntarily unemployed young persons <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that on the hypothesis that the diagnosis of the noble lord lord barnett was accurate his prescription to increase public expenditure is the exact opposite of what the situation would require <e>", "<cs> one understands entirely the generous emotions that move the right reverend prelate in proposing the amendment <e> <s> however with great respect to him that approach is founded on two fallacies <e> <s> the first fallacy is that by operating sanctions against south africa we are in some mysterious way going to improve the condition of the non-white races in south africa <e> <s> how one improves their condition by making them unemployed is not a thing that i have ever quite worked out <e> <s> why it should be thought that by diminishing the employment-giving capacity and the wealth-producing power of south africa to perhaps a considerable degree we shall induce changes which otherwise will not take place seems to me a quite extraordinary idea <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will listen not one of the things he is best at he is much better at talking he will see that this is highly relevant <e> <s> if he does not see that it is relevant then he does not understand the amendment <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate cannot get away with that <e> <s> he spelt out very emotionally and very movingly that the question of where a local authority bought from raised moral issues and that he for one took the line that one should not buy on moral grounds from particular countries <e> <s> that was the whole point of his speech <e>", "<cs> with great respect it did not have any other point <e> <s> the right reverend prelate cannot now stand up and say of course this has nothing to do with sanctions <e> <s> it has everything to do with sanctions as the right reverend prelate knows <e> <s> i think that he would come better out of this debate if he frankly admitted that <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> the distinction is this <e> <s> in the case of a local authority the action taken probably approved by a majority but disapproved by a minority is outside the scope of that authoritys function <e> <s> in the case of central government that is not so <e>", "<cs> i cannot rival the conservatism of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby whose theme was that he wanted to leave matters alone <e> <s> he is against change <e> <s> nonetheless he indulged in a real fallacy <e> <s> he said why not leave the local electorate to deal with a local authority that uses its money for party political propaganda <e> <s> there is a simple answer to that <e> <s> it may well be that there is a strong element among the local electorate which thoroughly agrees with the use of its money for party political propaganda <e>", "<cs> in a moment but not in mid-sentence but and this may help the noble <e>", "<cs> i am well aware of the act <e> <s> i believe i inflicted a speech or so on this chamber when we dealt with that act and i am certain that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby did so too <e> <s> however even that distinguished parentage of the measure does not necessarily prove that it is perfect <e>", "<cs> in response to the comments made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby i believe that television viewers will regard this committee with great respect for the trouble that it is taking to get the bill right whatever their views <e> <s> the noble lord says that the viewers will see aged peers <e> <s> they may see the noble lord lord houghton but on the other hand when their eyes turn to the government front bench whatever accusation can be made against the minister great age is not one of them <e> <s> i believe that viewers will be deeply impressed to see that a peer of his relative youth is able to handle this complex material with such skill patience and effectiveness <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said on an earlier amendment that we were not even trying to get things right <e> <s> i would certainly agree that that observation applied to his own contribution <e> <s> however members of the committee generally are trying to get this right <e> <s> what the noble lord lord hutchinson has just said confirms what i said a moment or two ago about his attitude <e> <s> if a play is put on which is intended to promote homosexuality i think that it would not be and should not be a defence that it was also of high artistic or literary merit <e> <s> if the purpose was the promotion of homosexuality literary merit is and should be no defence <e> <s> if a play is put on in the general way and is not intended to promote homosexuality it is all right <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord really saying- it is interesting because i think he has unconsciously come clean that one can put on shall we say a play the clear purpose of which is to promote homosexuality and hope to get away with it because it is of high literary quality <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> it is the noble lord who has committed himself not the government <e> <s> he has made it clear and it is useful to have got this clear that one can put on a play deliberately designed to corrupt young people <e>", "<cs> deliberately designed to corrupt young people and get away with it if it is written by someone whose literary skills are adequate to enable it to claim high artistic or literary character <e> <s> it is extremely interesting to have extracted that from the noble lord <e> <s> it has taken a good many hours to do it but the truth is now out <e>", "<cs> i am not dealing at the moment with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was dealing with the one specific point as to whether a play or any other publication designed deliberately to promote homosexuality and thereby to corrupt young people should get away with it because it had high literary merit <e> <s> i confine myself to that point and resting on that i feel that the other parts of amendment no <e> <s> do not arise although i demur to the suggestion at the end that if the reference were educational that perhaps would not matter <e> <s> it is a question of the intention <e>", "<cs> i was not in fact referring to lord hutchinson of lullingtons point i was dealing directly with his noble friend on the front bench to whom i directed the question <e> <s> therefore i have nothing whatever to withdraw in respect of the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington although i felt that his speech tended as they so often do to miss the point <e>", "<cs> i declare an interest as a director of a company that owns a good many london theatres <e> <s> having said that i make the simple point in response to the amendment of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that it would seem very odd to make an exception of the theatre as compared with every other activity <e> <s> i do not yield to him in my admiration for the very high standard of the theatre in england today whether owned by private enterprise or operated by local authorities <e> <s> although there may be some force in what he has said it would be a great mistake to make a conspicuous exception and a grant of special immunity from <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord grimond and the most reverend primate the archbishop of york both suggested that this clause was the wrong method for dealing with what i think both of them conceded to be a real problem <e> <s> the committee will have noted that both the most reverend primate and the noble lord lord grimond did not advocate any alternative method of dealing with the situation <e> <s> in a limited but important number of boroughs a situation exists where the local authority is seeking to promote homosexual ideas in schools indeed involving some persecution of <e>", "<cs> the noble lords argument seems to be the odd one that because there are other evils as of course there are this one should not be dealt with when it can be dealt with by the proposals which the government are adopting <e> <s> that is a very defeatist line for the noble lord to take a defeatist line even for a distinguished leader of the liberal party <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the most reverend primate for that intervention <e> <s> i think there are two answers to it <e> <s> on the second point about the supply of information i read nothing into this clause that would prevent the supply of relevant balanced information if somebody asked for it <e> <s> as regards the new relationships in schools i do not follow him <e> <s> as i understand it there is nothing in the education bill now at present passing its peaceful way through another place to deal with this particular point <e> <s> therefore we come back to the fact that those who would take this clause out of the bill without offering an alternative are saying to our fellow countrymen yes we know there is an evil here which may do harm to the lives of quite a number of young people <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord grimond is grateful to the noble baroness for intervening on his behalf and giving the answer which he conspicuously failed to give to me <e> <s> however it is surely obvious and obvious to the noble baroness that if there is power in the act no government having that power would put itself to the trouble and difficulty of introducing further and new legislation <e> <s> that would be nonsense <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to quote me perhaps he will be good enough to do it accurately <e> <s> i said that where a publication was intended to promote homosexuality the fact that it was expressed in fine literary language was not a defence <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite the gloomy observations of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton all experience of other activities which have been privatised supports the assertion in the statement that the functions of this body can be more efficiently performed in the private sector <e> <s> can he confirm that the necessary legislation will be introduced during the current session <e>", "<cs> my lords as high steward and a former member of parliament for kingston i should like to thank my noble friend for her graceful and kindly reference to the great education success of the kingston borough council <e> <s> arising from that does that not illustrate the extraordinary situation there has been in recent years in which large and wealthy boroughs such as westminster kensington and chelsea have not had education authorities whereas education authorities have existed in much smaller places <e> <s> i suggest to my noble friend that if education is to be a locally administered service then it is absurd that such large boroughs should he excluded from the administration of education <e>", "<cs> my noble friend did ask a question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals sought to fasten on this not very important amendment a general attack on the handling by the government of social security both as i understand it under this bill and generally <e> <s> he failed to appreciate that the purpose and the effect of this clause is simply to restore the position to what everyone thought it was before the high court decision in the case to which he referred that of <e>", "<cs> by saying that the noble lord did not understand <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish the sentence and then i shall give the noble lord something to intervene about <e> <s> the noble lord did not understand the proper function of a social security minister <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will also be good enough to look at <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord ennals will allow me to say so the object of the amendment seems very sensible <e> <s> one would not wish in any way to discourage a return to work or to education and training by someone who has been sufficiently disabled to have an allowance <e> <s> however so far as a return to work is concerned at present wage levels in general the discouragement would be very small because it is unlikely that the wage earned would be other than a great deal more substantial than the allowance <e> <s> i think that the noble lords argument is stronger as regards education or training <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ennals said this is not one amendment but three <e> <s> it is perhaps a little inconvenient to deal with them together but as they have been so moved i suppose that the committee had better consider them in that way <e> <s> as regards the first two amendments which lay down time limits for proceedings i am a little puzzled by the drafting of the proposals <e> <s> i have complete sympathy with their purpose <e> <s> there has always been too much delay in dealing with many of these matters <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals rightly pointed out that can cause great hardship and give an impression of inefficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend concerned about the effect on the unemployment figures of the recent sharp rise in wage levels and the strike action by which those have been obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite the mitigations of the rule to which he has referred there are many people who find it very difficult to understand how it is possible to justify paying a lower pension to the war widow pre- than to those widowed after that date <e> <s> surely it is the older war widow whose need is the greatest <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks was right when he said that the great majority of young people will not be affected by this clause because they will have the good sense to accept the possibilities and opportunities offered to them by the yts and will not choose voluntary unemployment <e> <s> however he went on to argue that because it would only be a minority of young people who if left to themselves would choose voluntary unemployment and financial support at the public expense we should not legislate <e> <s> i do not follow that argument <e>", "<cs> that is what the clause is designed to deal with <e> <s> i am glad to hear noble lords opposite saying no <e> <s> very few of us would feel that it was right to leave that so both on the general principle and also because when one is young few things can be more demoralising than unemployment and voluntary unemployment is perhaps one degree worse <e> <s> indeed noble lords opposite when they thought they were on to a good thing on the issue of unemployment were often full of the most <e>", "<cs> i can answer that question easily <e> <s> if one uses the act one has to show that the person concerned has refused several offers of employment <e> <s> therefore the matter will drag on for a long time <e> <s> the person concerned will say oh i did not like that job but hope another one will turn up and so on and will shilly-shally in that way <e> <s> furthermore while the matter is dragging on he will be drawing benefit <e> <s> it is to prevent such a situation that the clause is necessary in other words the act is no answer quite apart from the administrative complications of which the noble baroness spoke that would be involved in following up case after case of refusals of employment with all the arguments that can be adduced as to why any particular employment was not attractive to the person concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down she seems to have missed the point that the yts for those aged between and is to be universal <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend go a little further than this <e> <s> he accepts that the has been steadily eroded <e> <s> thanks to the good economic policy of the government it has not been eroded recently very fast but all the same it has been eroded <e> <s> as my noble friend said that there will be future <e>", "<cs> nonetheless can my noble friend answer my question <e> <s> i am not quite sure what he said in reply to my question as to whether in bringing forward the legislation he has forecast serious consideration will be given to adjusting the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an odd amendment <e> <s> i fully understand that noble lords opposite do not like the compulsory putting out to tender of activities at present undertaken by a local authority <e> <s> one fully understands that doctrinally they do not like it <e> <s> but what is difficult to understand is why sport and leisure should be singled out as activities which could not through the process of affirmative resolution and so on be included in the category of defined activities <e> <s> a much better case was made out on the previous amendment where we dealt with serious responsibilities such as a local authoritys responsibility for civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of procedure with which i can assure noble lords i have been familiar for many years <e> <s> i do not think that that is an answer because the decision would be a simple one not giving rise to amendment <e> <s> either an order is presented to take these activities and make them into defined activities with all the consequences with respect to putting out to tender or it is not <e> <s> therefore it would be a straight issue as to whether this house and another place thought fit to approve the order <e> <s> as i see it there could be no useful purpose served by fussing about with amendments <e> <s> it still seems most peculiar that these two activities sports and leisure should be picked out specially to be made into a category which cannot be turned into defined activity while for the purposes of discussing the amendment all the other activities of a local authority can be <e>", "<cs> my lords where in those two options or variants on them to which the noble lord refers is there any inhibition on a local authority which wishes to put these services out to contract specifying in the contract to be signed by the other party that specific provision shall be made for particular categories of people for particular opening hours or for particular sports <e> <s> if one puts a service out to contract it is a matter of what one negotiates into the contract <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey referred to the governments attitude as lying on their back with their paws in the air because the government drew the attention of your lordships to the distinct possibility that action of this kind would be contrary to the treaty of rome <e> <s> i do not claim to be an expert on the treaty of rome and i do not have the faintest idea whether or not this particular proposal would be contrary to that treaty but i should have thought that it was not very good legislative practice to legislate to give to local authorities powers which there was some reason to believe might be illegal under the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the noble lords attempt to suggest that this is a different approach from that on which we spent a good deal of time in committee the amendment is in fact fundamentally the same as that which we discussed earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have thought that even a liberal peer would find it possible to introduce the doctrine of proportional representation into a debate dealing with the problems of homosexuality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i am not giving way for the moment <e> <s> will the noble baroness resume her seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give way but not in the middle of a sentence <e> <s> i therefore continue to say that i suppose that it may be although it is not obvious to me that there is some connection between the two doctrines <e> <s> i now give way to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear most of what the noble baroness said <e> <s> as it apparently was not intended as a compliment i shall not worry myself too much about it <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that the amendment is basically a waste of time <e> <s> by proposing to delete lines to it virtually removes the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> many of us are thankful that there is no compulsion to go to discos <e> <s> i accept at once that there is a distinction <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord is arguing that it is wrong to corrupt children in schools and that it is all right to corrupt them in discos <e> <s> i do not know if that is his argument <e> <s> but the fact remains i shall give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree <e> <s> if a local authority promotes homosexual ideas at public expense with attractive trimmings and music that a great many people like then whether or not the noble lord is right in calling that compelling such persons to listen to such things i do not know <e> <s> but i do not think that even the noble lord can deny that that is promotion of homosexual ideas and that if you promote homosexuality by attracting people to a function that is just as much promoting it as if you promoted it by compelling them to go to school <e> <s> therefore though they are different activities and properly dealt with by different paragraphs in the original clause they are both evils which i suggest to your lordships it should be the purpose of public policy to avoid <e> <s> while offering what the noble lord lord ritchie believes i think wrongly to be some protection in schools this amendment offers no protection whatever to young people against activities promoted out of school <e> <s> i hope that without wasting much time on it your lordships will reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> will he add to it by telling the house how the spanish government have sought to reconcile this restriction on the use of gibraltar airport with their desire to share in its operation <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a connection between the two matters inasmuch as the spanish attitude on the use of spanish airspace for military aircraft into gibraltar airport must induce a mood of suspicion in the gibraltar government and people

that disabled people should get the fullest possible training <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is i think indulging in a half truth <e> <s> to take the example of the lawyers that is not a closed shop in the sense in which we discuss it in the trade union world because no one can be a member of those professions who has not passed the necessary examinations <e> <s> there is no necessary

difference <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord began by misquoting me <e> <s> i did not say that i would support the closed shop if it depended upon qualifications <e> <s> what i did was to point out

will he look very anxiously at the question of whether there will be enough runway capacity available in a few years time <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend answer the question put by the noble lord the leader of the opposition as to the powers of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords has consideration been given following the example of certain european cities to banning the entry into the central area of very large vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords to have ones cake eat it and welcome it with open arms seems an extraordinarily agile performance <e> <s> although none of your lordships would deny the quality of agility to my noble friend i am not sure that it is a wholly appetising prospect which we are offered <e>", "<cs> my lords if local authorities were prepared to get on with the job of restraining the activities of a good many of them who use public funds for party political purposes there would not have been any necessity for the clause as a whole or for this part of the bill <e> <s> however the very fact at any rate in the view of her majestys government and parliament so far that it is necessary to legislate to restrain those activities surely indicates that one cannot leave to a local authority association the drafting of the code of practice <e> <s> if local authorities were so well disposed so responsible and as public spirited as the noble lord lord hayter seems to suggest it would not be just a question of a code of practice but of whether it was necessary to legislate at all on this matter <e> <s> i know it is something about which some of your lordships take different views but so far we have proceeded on the basis that it is necessary to legislate on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she allow me to say that she has given me my case because what she is saying is that she is against the promotion of party politics on the rates and therefore supports this amendment <e> <s> that is exactly the point i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i very much regret the necessity for the introduction of this bill <e> <s> it was introduced because of certain abuses and certain things going wrong in local government <e> <s> i am afraid it is an example of the well-known principle that if those in public positions and public authority over a long period abuse their powers do wrong then sooner or later a change has to be effected and responsibility for that change lies with the national government and with parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right and the electorate <e> <s> indeed the approach which lies behind this bill was only as recently as last june endorsed by the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord is ignoring the fact that in a unitary system of government such as ours the sovereign power is the crown in parliament <e> <s> that means does it not <e> <s> that unless parliament is prepared to acquiesce in wrongdoing wrongdoing will flourish but it gives to that sovereign parliament the ultimate duty of putting it right <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has referred to me will she allow me to say that i did indicate amusement and i hope she did not regard that as discourteous <e> <s> it happened simply because i find absolutely fascinating the way in which spokespersons from the liberal benches succeed in dragging in proportional representation on every conceivable subject and i was delighted to sec the noble baroness right up to form <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on this particular amendment has been a vivid and for some of us a somewhat nostalgic revelation of the difficulties that face those who are responsible for social service and social security administration <e> <s> it is always possible if a particular benefit is in some cases abolished or in others restricted to raise genuine and sincere feeling and emotion and to suggest that something terribly wrong is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the noble lord means by saying which one <e> <s> he spoke at any rate from a sedentary position <e> <s> i was in fact coming to the question of concentration <e> <s> it is the family support arrangements that are based on need <e> <s> it is exactly that concentration in those areas which must be the main object of any good minister who is in charge of social security <e> <s> therefore although it is necessary to endure if you do so the criticism in respect of the area from which you are to some extent diverting those resources nonetheless i do not think any serious student of socal policy can doubt that that is the right course to take <e> <s> it is for that reason that i think the government are right in this matter and i think that the amendment however much it may have a sentimental appeal is not one which is consistent with intelligent clearly thought out social policy such as i hope that the government will always follow <e>", "<cs> my lords first in the light of what i was saying i should stress that i was not referring to the married womans allowance <e> <s> however were we to have the opportunity to debate that matter i should have the greatest pleasure of doing so with the noble lord <e> <s> i am far too old a hand to be caught out by such a catch question as the noble lord should know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled about this amendment which seeks to put social fund officers within the purview of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> i should be extremely surprised i may be rusty about this if they were not already there <e>", "<cs> members of the committee discussed this issue at some length during the second reading of the bill <e> <s> indeed some of us expressed the view that it was one of the important aspects of the bill from the point of view of its major policy of restoring power to the individual trade unionist as against the leadership of the unions <e> <s> it is obviously very relevant to that because it involves some redistribution of power within a union <e>", "<cs> yes though it is not a very convenient moment but i have such an admiration for the noble lord that of course i shall give way <e>", "<cs> that is not a point that arises on the amendment <e> <s> the point that arises on the amendment is that the union member should be protected if notwithstanding the decision of the union to take industrial action he continues to work <e> <s> i have suggested that there may be factors in his mind which will weigh in favour of so doing <e> <s> the noble lord asks a fascinating question what happens if the union member goes further and takes action against his union as he describes <e> <s> that raises an interesting matter but it is not a question which arises on the amendment <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord i propose to stick to the amendment <e>", "<cs> just wait a moment <e> <s> i shall give way of course <e> <s> those members made that a priority and the union imposed the substantial fines <e> <s> now the noble lord may intervene if he wishes <e>", "<cs> again the noble lord is trying to widen the scope of the amendment which he is supporting <e> <s> i hope he will not mind if i bring him firmly back to this amendment <e> <s> the issues he raises are fascinating <e> <s> they may well arise on other amendments <e> <s> they do not arise on this one <e> <s> on the present amendment i am quoting the wapping case against what he said that is that the penalties are very often not enforced <e> <s> in that particular case substantial fines were imposed on members of that union who had in the view of many of us properly decided to support their newspapers against a wholly irresponsible and foolish strike <e>", "<cs> and one which as the noble lord may remember ended in failure for the union <e>", "<cs> that may well he <e> <s> it certainly adds to the view that some of us take that they acted more responsibly as well as more sensibly than their union in the course of a very foolish and unsuccessful industrial action <e>", "<cs> nor wise <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add to what my noble friend lord renton has said <e> <s> the analogy with the golf club and the charming lady in shorts is a false one for this reason <e> <s> trade unions are bodies given substantial privileges by law the major one being not to be liable to be sued in tort in respect of industrial action <e> <s> when you have bodies such as that which are favoured by the legislature with privileges of that sort it necessarily goes with that that they must be subject to rather more obligations than bodies such as golf clubs which have no such privileges <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that people do not need to join a union <e> <s> that is not always true <e> <s> from a practical point of view even with the reductions which i am glad to say are now being made in the closed shop there is still a considerable number of cases where a man simply is not going to get a job if he is not a member of a union <e> <s> therefore it is quite wrong and quite inaccurate to say that a man does not have to join a union he may well have to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that <e> <s> of course that is a wholly unreal approach and he knows that perfectly well <e> <s> he knows that if an employer for whatever reason offers increased wages it is likely that the ordinary human being will take them <e> <s> that is nothing whatever to do with being prepared to give the union and its activities priority over the other interests duties and obligations which he has <e> <s> the noble lord knows that perfectly well <e>", "<cs> of course the noble lord is right about that section <e> <s> but there still remains very substantial privilege as regards industrial action and being sued in respect of it <e> <s> the noble lord knows that as well as anyone <e>", "<cs> i believe that at this stage the relevant thought is that the side note to the clause is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will realise that the first point does not arise in connection with the bill <e> <s> we are discussing the second point <e> <s> it is clear that the representatives of the labour party believe it to be right that a worker should be unjustifiably disciplined <e> <s> i believe that that will be noticed outside this committee <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has ventured to refer to me i should perhaps say that so far from being pleased i was merely being amused <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will pay particular attention to the amendment in the name of my noble friend viscount brentford <e> <s> it seems to me that he has made a valid point on the rather curious use of the word incidental <e> <s> to take the obvious case if a solicitor attends a meeting in order to advise a union on whether to fight a certain issue or to settle or give way he is then giving advice not incidental to the decision but crucial to it <e> <s> his advice will bear on the decision which that committee ought to take <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press my noble friend a little further but i am not happy about the word incidental in subsection ab <e> <s> i wish to refer to the example that i put to the minister earlier which he did not deal with <e> <s> if a union is faced with a possibility of legal proceedings will it decide to fight <e> <s> the legal adviser turns up to advise <e> <s> that is not <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is normally extremely fair in what she says <e> <s> i believe that she has earned the respect of the committee for the way in which she has led the opposition to this measure <e> <s> i was therefore the more surprised when she described the clause as malicious <e> <s> i believe that that description is quite unjustified <e> <s> it is surely not malice but a sensible view of our society that the role of trade unions particularly the major unions is so important that it is necessary to see that they are led by responsible people who are responsible to their members and to our country <e> <s> surely it is reasonable to provide as has been increasingly provided for in successive bills that the principal positions of those who control trade unions should be held by people who have been freely and honestly elected by the members <e>", "<cs> i wonder why the noble lord lord mccarthy gets so excited about this matter <e> <s> the committee has decided that there should be elections and it surely makes sense that those who are to vote have some idea of the policies and proposals that the various candidates adopt <e> <s> they should be helped to know what they are voting for <e> <s> it seems quite extraordinary that the noble lord lord mccarthy should work himself up into almost hysterical excitement at the idea that those who vote in trade unions should actually be assisted to know what they are voting about and what the candidates stand for <e> <s> for some reason it may be that the noble lord believes such a measure will undermine the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> there is a simple answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> in this case we have discussed it at length and i shall not go on doing so parliament has laid down that there shall be <e>", "<cs> parliament is not at the moment legislating about voting for companies <e> <s> it is no use the noble lord dragging in companies as he has done i suppose half a dozen times in the past hours <e> <s> we are not legislating for companies at the moment <e> <s> when we come to a companies bill we can talk about that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is very agile but he must restrain his physical agility for a moment <e> <s> we do not want any dialectical abseiling in this particular debate <e> <s> we are legislating <e> <s> parliament has decided and the committee has decided that there shall be elections in trade unions <e> <s> it is therefore relevant to decide the conditions under which those elections shall take place <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand why members of the committee opposite want to deprive the voters in those elections of the information which this clause will give them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a publication called <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend indicate the reason for the answer which she gave to the question asked by the noble lord lord jay <e>", "<cs> my lords the only problem that arises on this amendment is one of precedent <e> <s> i am inclined to share the view which has already been expressed that one can pay too much attention to the risk of creating a precedent <e> <s> indeed noble lords may remember how amusingly this matter was dealt with by the late alan herbert in his delightful book <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the debate at the report stage to which the noble lord lord ennals has just referred though with my habitual diffidence i did not intervene <e> <s> we have had this evening very much a repetition of that debate and a largely semantic repetition at that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just years since i was first involved in social security legislation <e> <s> that experience gives me some idea of the immense feeling of relief that my noble friend lord skelmersdale must feel at having reached the final stage of this legislation in this house <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord ennals agrees with me <e> <s> no one who has not had the experience of piloting measures of that sort through either house of parliament can possibly understand the great feeling of relief and happiness which must be felt by a minister when the last lap is all but finished <e>", "<cs> this amendment does neither one thing nor the other it does not retain the membership of which seems to appeal to both the noble baronesses who have spoken on the other hand it proposes that six of the members should attend only in an advisory capacity <e> <s> it is not very clear what precisely is meant by an advisory capacity although i suppose it means that they would have no vote in the event of a difference <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> the point that i was trying to make was this and if i failed to make it clearly i apologise to members of the committee <e> <s> the employer is in the first place in a position to know what skills are likely to be required in future years <e> <s> he is in a position to know therefore not merely that people require to be trained but how many of those trained in particular skills will be taken up in employment <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> i did not say that he had sole knowledge <e> <s> the noble lord misunderstood <e> <s> i said that he had a major responsibility and i stick to that <e>", "<cs> on a separate point i question one word in the amendment <e> <s> i see the argument that the facilities should be reasonably suitable to the capacities and attitudes of the person concerned and of reasonable overall quality <e> <s> the word which i think calls for some explanation is requirements <e> <s> as i understand it the word requirements puts the decision in the hands of the young person concerned who could if he or she felt so inclined say oh well i require training in some speciality such as an astronaut or pop singer or something exciting but which is not a heavily populated occupation <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness has misled herself on the procedure regarding other increases in benefits <e> <s> she said quite rightly that the orders had to be laid before parliament <e> <s> but only in a very limited number of cases are they subject to the affirmative procedure which the amendment contemplates for the allowance <e> <s> the vast majority i speak from memory are laid and they can be prayed against in either house if any noble lord or member of another place wishes to do so <e> <s> that is a totally different procedure from the affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way but if he wishes to intervene we shall listen to him with the greatest of interest <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy obviously enjoyed himself as did your lordships in his good romping speech of which i venture to suggest he does not really believe half <e>", "<cs> a high-level course <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness pointed out very fairly that her amendment includes the word requirements which we discussed on an earlier amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear was good enough a little time ago to acknowledge that it was not an appropriate word in the context of the ealier amendment nor i would suggest to the committee in the context of this amendment <e>", "<cs> oh absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the people and government of gibraltar have to make for them an important and difficult decision <e> <s> it is particularly difficult for them to come to a sensible conclusion without knowing much more of the detail of what is proposed <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that it would simply not be good enough to ask them to accept and then fill in the gaps <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if as his replies appear to suggest the details of the arrangement are not to be disclosed until the people of gibraltar have reached a decision he is putting that decision at very great risk and making it much more likely that the people of gibraltar will reject the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords in respect of zero-rating of books and newspapers specifically is my noble friend aware that quite apart from the cost many people would find it repulsive to impose taxation on knowledge and the dissemination of knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords why does my noble friend think it safer for the motor-cyclist to turn his head to look over his shoulder than to glance into a mirror <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not accept this amendment whose purpose plainly is to weaken if not emasculate the clause <e> <s> that is indeed its purpose <e> <s> with that in mind it is perhaps relevant to recall that the headnote relating to this clause reads rights of trade union members <e> <s> that is its subject matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little surprised that the noble lord lord rochester supports this amendment because in the days when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in favour whichever way the vote goes of an unofficial body imposing punishment on british citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has confused two quite separate matters <e> <s> first there is the ballot for industrial action which he has described perfectly fairly and secondly what the amendment bites on what happens after the ballot when those who operate the union under the present law are free to punish those who did not take part <e> <s> that is what i object to <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will press his motion so that we can get rid of it <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that the introduction of this motion at this stage is simply an attempt to delay the bill <e> <s> he is far too well informed in the procedure of this house to believe that there is the slightest justification for the idea that the bill as it now stands involves hybridity <e> <s> indeed in the books on procedure it is quite clear that hybridity has to be far more precise in its effects on particular individuals than are the clauses in the bill as they now stand <e> <s> he will find that all the precedents point that way <e> <s> i am afraid that the fact that he sees fit to raise this matter at this stage late in the evening during the report stage <e>", "<cs> of the bill and when he himself says that he is pointing out that any invalidity that arose in committee <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble lord said that <e> <s> if he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that if this motion were accepted it would delay the bill because it could not proceed further until the examiners had examined it from the point of view of hybridity <e> <s> the noble lord knows that perfectly well and that is why he is doing it <e> <s> i do not know why he is wasting the time of the house by denying it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has given details of the

lordships house echo the hope that in view of its very great importance it may be the subject matter of debate in here before long <e>", "<cs> they are here my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us find his reply to the noble lord lord airedale most reassuring <e> <s> will the government continue to bear in mind that as easter is the chief festival of the christian year its date is much more a matter for the churches than for governments <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the strength of sterling which is the matter now causing comment is a considerable justification of the economic policy pursued by the government <e> <s> does my noble friend recall the contrast of the weakness of sterling when noble lords opposite were in charge <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if that answer means as it seems to mean that the site is to be sold that will be a matter for great congratulation for the ratepayers of london <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that all governments have followed the policy in this respect which my noble friend has outlined as the policy of the present government <e> <s> are not the government to be congratulated on the fact that the results have been very successful <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that commodious premises suitable for occupation by the european parliament will

politically orientated <e> <s> he remarked that i would understand that expression when he used it <e> <s> i retort that when used by him it is an expression used with full knowledge because the record of the government over which he presided whatever else it was he will agree that unhappily it was not a very successful government was highly politically orientated <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friends hope that from onwards we shall continue our good record in comparison with our european friends very greatly dependent on the exercise of restraint in wage increases by all those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little unhappy with the argument of my noble friend lord carr of hadley based on analogy with public companies <e> <s> it is true as he said that in many cases public companies appoint their chief executives below board level <e> <s> but it is equally true in my experience and certainly that of the noble lord himself that many companies have an executive chairman who is elected by the company and many more have a managing director who is in a full sense a director and as such is also elected by the shareholders <e> <s> that surely shows that the argument that insistence upon election must negative the appointment of efficient administrators really does not stand up very well <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to answer my noble friends question if the noble lord will permit me <e> <s> the situation i am sure is as i have tried to describe it <e> <s> a company decides whether a high officer shall also have administrative responsibilities whether as chairman or as managing director and he will be appointed by a vote of the shareholders <e> <s> in my experience that has never resulted other than in the appointment of a highly efficient person <e> <s> as i understand the bill where we are not talking of someone in a position covered by the amendment but of a lower administrator

attractive to many of us than a holiday which at the moment is often known colloquially as the feast of st marx and st engels <e>", "<cs> it is very agreeable to be able to listen to a speech from the episcopal bench with which one wholly agrees <e> <s> i am indebted to the right reverend prelate the bishop of london for giving me that agreeable experience which i hope will often be repeated in the

thoughtful and penetrating speech with which he opened it <e> <s> i think i can make no better comment on that speech than saying that it was what one would expect from a fellow of all souls <e> <s>

determine them <e> <s> so far this debate has been concerned basically with those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always anxious to oblige the noble lord opposite and if within the reasonable time that i allot myself i can pass on to such forms of taxation then i shall gladly do so <e> <s> however i must return to the point regarding the stimulation of entrepreneurial activity <e> <s> it is direct taxation on incomes which is directly relevant <e> <s> the other forms of taxation especially in the case of national insurance contributions have a certain relevance but the crucial point from which i do not wish to be led is the effect of income tax on enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord misunderstood what i said <e> <s> what i was saying i apologise if it is obvious was that the standard of life in the united states was infinitely higher than that in the soviet union that is of course if one excepts the

cuts resulted <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that whatever the decision of the european court such a tax cannot be imposed without the consent of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords is

of law that a sane man is deemed to intend the natural consequences of his acts <e> <s> the natural consequence of acceptance of the amendment inevitably as anyone with any knowledge of public administration knows perfectly well is a substantial delay in the operation of clause and the abolition of ilea <e> <s> of course i accept that the right reverend prelate does not want that though i

however large a pension is now being paid to a member of a religious community he shall still receive exemption from the community charge <e> <s> it is not unknown for people who have had a successful career in the world as a result of which they have retired with a substantial pension to spend their declining years in a religious community <e> <s> that is not an unusual phenomenon <e> <s> however it seems ridiculous that if a large pension were being paid to such a person he should be exempted from the charge <e> <s> will my noble friend consider putting a limit on this and excluding it only where the pension is of fairly modest dimension <e>", "<cs> if that be so why is it necessary to have sub-paragraph disregarding the pension <e> <s> either there will be a pension and in those circumstances i suggest that the exemption should be limited in respect of the amount of the pension or as my noble friend says if it is not going to apply to anyone who has a pension why on earth is

taking the place of the older practice of towing away <e> <s> may i ask whether he and the metropolitan police appreciate that a clamped car that is obstructing traffic continues to obstruct the traffic for longer than it might otherwise have done whereas once a car is towed away there is no further obstruction <e>", "<cs> i cannot see the necessity for this amendment <e> <s> if the duty is first to set up and then to maintain a register surely that carries an obligation to keep it up to date <e> <s> the noble lords amendment is a double statement and is quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i do not have the scottish act with me but i am prepared to discuss the matter simply on the merits if the noble lord does not regard it as offensive as they apply to the english bill <e> <s> i ask how one can possibly maintain a register if one does not keep it up to date <e>", "<cs> with respect this is not a question of the scottish provision <e> <s> it is simply a <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord somers it depends on what one is talking about <e> <s> if one is talking about a register one is not maintaining it if one allows it to become out of date <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment is understandable because he rightly like most members of the committee does not wish to discourage people entitled to go on the electoral register from going on it <e> <s> as many members of the committee with experience of local and parliamentary government know the electoral register is not always as complete as one would wish and as it should be in a democracy <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble lord fully appreciates the imputation he is making against the moral standards of some of our fellow countrymen <e> <s> he suggests that there are people he referred specifically to young people who wish to go on the electoral register so as to be able to vote and determine the policy of their local authority but who at the same time wish to evade making the financial contribution which the decisions of that local authority may impose <e>", "<cs> i did not say that there was no one <e> <s> i said that it was a grave reflection on a large number of people

avoidance which is a complex subject relating mainly not to this topic but to income tax which i shall be <e>", "<cs> as one would expect of him the noble earl put his case much more plausibly than did his noble friend who moved the amendment <e> <s> however it was plausible rather than convincing <e> <s> the noble lord lord meston made the point that if it were known that the electoral register could be used to construct the register quite a number of people who would otherwise go on the electoral register would not put their name forward <e> <s> that was his clear statement <e> <s> it was to that clear statement and the reflection that it conveyed on a number of our fellow citizens that i took and take exception <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord as a former financial secretary to the treasury suggesting that tax evasion is simply the prerogative of the poor <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was quite right when he said that it was important that the major regulations should be made in good time so <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for that commentary <e> <s> but it amounts to the fact that he is perfectly legitimately seeking the intentions of the government on timing but is proposing an amendment which he does not want to put into the bill <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is answering that question perhaps he will also answer something to which he referred that seems a little <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that his proposal concerning whitsun would make a great deal of sense if the government proceed as i understand they are considering proceeding to do away with the bank holiday at the beginning of may and to transfer it to october <e> <s> one would then have easter and whitsun both feasts of the church and both with a fairly constant margin

swap them <e>", "<cs> my lords is not my noble friend aware that the official aid figure is not the only figure that matters <e> <s> is it not a fact that investment by the public and the private sector of this country in the developing world is at a highly creditable level and is at least as important as official aid <e>", "<cs> i understand that the list of groupings as originally placed in the printed paper office has been withdrawn and a subsequent amended one put into issue <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend can arrange for amended copies to be made available to the committee in the chamber <e>", "<cs> the speech and the amendment of the noble baroness lady stedman are obviously inspired from the point of view of local authorities <e> <s> looked at solely from their point of view

system <e> <s> can he say whether it has been possible to provide those details <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the information given by her majestys government to the gibraltar government covers the question of the size of the gate leading from the gibraltar-owned airport into spanish territory <e> <s> is it to be the kind of gate through which an aeroplane can go or only passengers <e>", "<cs> the last two speakers made very clear their opposition to the main principles of the bill <e> <s> i am in a different position since i am a supporter of the main principles of the bill <e> <s> i speak briefly this afternoon on that basis although my comments will be directed toward the specific amendments under discussion <e> <s> perhaps i may add that i do not have to declare an interest in respect of westminster <e> <s> my london home is half the width of a street outside the city of westminster <e> <s> that half-width of the street costs me an additional several hundreds of pounds a year in rates because the borough in which my home is located charges a higher rate than does the city of westminster <e> <s> i should be only too happy if that halfwidth of the street could be eliminated <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the best ways of encouraging this useful expenditure to do what the government are doing and which comes into effect today that is to

house both a few minutes ago and at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that intervention though i am far from clear what the point of it was <e> <s> if he is saying as apparently he is that young and cynical people in not very good schools in scotland would not operate very well under this system i am wholly prepared to agree with him <e> <s> what i am arguing about and it is more relevant to this amendment is that it would be quite disastrous in inferior schools in england <e> <s> that i notice he did not contradict <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness misunderstood me <e> <s> i was referring to the fact that at the committee stage as earlier this afternoon your lordships came down in favour of the other system that embodied in the bill of the core curriculum and that this is simply an attempt to go back on that <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend clear up one point on the ruling he has just given <e> <s> if one is in the position as i think i am of favouring some of the subsequent amendments of the right reverend prelate but being against others how am i to vote on the paving amendment <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> shame <e>", "<cs> they usually do <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord to which amendment he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a point regarding the drafting of the amendment which i think is probably fatal to it in any case <e> <s> the noble lord lord young of dartington seems to assume that all children are the children of one-parent families <e> <s> he refers in the amendment to the parent of any pupil <e> <s> surely if he is trying to legislate he should either say parents or a parent <e> <s> it is not to be assumed even nowadays that there are no children who are the children of married couples <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason why the amendment should not be correctly drafted rather than relying on the interpretation act <e> <s> the noble lord should rely on accurate drafting <e> <s> he should have said parents if that was what he meant or a parent if that was what he meant <e> <s> the interpretation act however ingeniously deployed by the noble lord lord morton of shuna does not let him off that hook <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that unambiguous reply <e> <s> are the government weighing the economic consequences of the maintenance of our crazy system of sunday legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that the events of two years ago to which he properly referred were not unconnected with the activities of the well-heeled pressure groups about which the noble lord opposite has warned him <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the government have any idea as to where the hooligans concerned get the funds to enable them to travel to these places <e> <s> presumably they are not working <e> <s> are they on social security <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what guarantee there is particularly in the light of recent experience that in the event of a serious emergency by way of fire a competent person will be available to operate the switches <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the ticket office in the station adjoining the palace of westminster is often closed <e> <s> when he says that there should be a competent person available can he tell the house what steps are being taken particularly in the light of recent experience of london underground to ensure that there is <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems a most unwise amendment <e> <s> it means that the parents with the most experience of the working of the school are for that reason to be denied a vote <e> <s> parents of a child <e>", "<cs> my lords i made no such assumption <e>

perhaps he can look at the manual of procedure and we would get on quicker <e> <s> i made no suggestion one way or the other <e> <s> i merely said that we wanted to get the right decision and that those with most experience of a school would be most likely to give the right decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the right reverend prelates amendments are technically correct and no doubt my noble friend the minister will tell us but i am bound to say that his argument seemed to be unanswerable <e> <s> surely both churches should be treated alike and in both cases the trustees brought in <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be able to accept the spirit of this even if the wording requires further amendment at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that the leader of the house is in his place <e> <s> i should like to support the point made by my noble friend lord renton on the proposed timing of the further stages of this bill because that timing is highly relevant to this amendment and to the one which the noble baroness is about to move <e> <s> if my noble friend lord renton is well informed he generally is it is apparently the intention to take the third reading on tuesday of next week <e> <s> i suggest most earnestly to my noble friend the leader of the house that that will cause very considerable difficulty <e> <s> i do not need to stress to him because he knows it that this is one of the most important pieces of legislation for many years <e> <s> it is years since we had an education bill and many of us who have been taking part hope it will be another years before there is another <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the strong feelings that the noble lord lord peston has about free schooling <e> <s> the views that he holds and expresses are probably widely held in the house and elsewhere but i am unhappy about the second part of his amendment the exclusion of any possibility of an opted-out school going in for selection <e>

baronesses on the benches opposite becoming so critical of public expenditure and urging restraint in public spending <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an experience which has all the charm of novelty <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness wishes to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has only said at several times greater length what i was saying that is she and her noble friend on the front bench were criticising public expenditure and urging restraint in public expenditure <e> <s> i said it rather more briefly <e> <s> as i say it is a refreshing experience to hear that comment from the benches opposite <e> <s> of course the truth of the matter is that noble lords and noble baronesses opposite do not like the idea of the city technology colleges <e> <s> they do not appreciate their importance whereas to me and possibly to other noble lords they are one of the most encouraging aspects of the governments education policy because the intention is to develop those organisations to train people for what is our enormously important need people trained in the technologies and processes which will help our industry to continue to expand and develop <e>", "<cs> my lords if one wanted to politicise governing bodies adopting this amendment would be the way to do it because it suggests that in considering who should be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another issue

raised the question of the timing of the third reading of the education reform bill with my noble friend perhaps i may thank him warmly for the way in which he has dealt with the submissions made to him which provided that the bill is delivered as he has said on monday gives sufficient time for your lordships to study it with a view to the possible submission of amendments <e> <s> some of us with ministerial experience realise how difficult it is to alter the timetable and therefore we appreciate all the more the action taken by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> does he recall that on monday in reply to the noble lord lord kennet he said at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord allows this system with its inherent dangers

considerable time in a stack <e> <s> can my noble friend say what the government are doing about that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend referred to the evidence given by the caa <e> <s> will he deal with the point which i put to him on my earlier question which he has not yet answered as to whether he is aware that the shortage of air space which admittedly is the immediate problem is accentuated by the shortage of runways <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend the minister will treat this amendment very seriously <e> <s> i hope that he will either accept it as it stands to my amateur eye its drafting looks impeccable or if with the aid of his experts the minister finds some deficiency in the drafting will be prepared to accept it in principle and bring forward a corrected version at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> your lordships have just heard an extremely moving speech from the noble baroness opposite <e> <s> i think very few of us were unaffected by it spoken as it was with the immense experience of the noble baroness in these matters and her record of wonderful service to unfortunate people <e>", "<cs> my lords while my noble friend is referring to these figures will he tell noble lords how much money the government are expecting to receive from charities as a result of the european court decision <e> <s> surely that should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself for once in agreement with the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i am delighted to tell my noble friend how glad i am to see these proposals <e> <s> from the beginning the dual system looked as though it was going to be complicated and difficult to operate and very difficult to justify in principle <e> <s> it seems to me a great improvement to move straight over to the new system <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say how sorry i am that he insists on attributing all the credit for the new realism to the government and denies any of it to the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the proposal in the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord <e> <s> throughout the debates on the bill there has been an enormous amount of discussion about the technical complications in respect of finance which will be facing local authorities <e> <s> if ever there was a case for having a chief finance officer that is an officer with experience and responsibility in financial matters it is surely this one <e> <s> we are concerned with large sums of public money <e> <s> i say nothing against chief executive officers <e> <s> they are generally people of high standing often with legal qualifications <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord opposite would understand that a specialist concentrating on matters of finance would be needed for those various functions <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an odd amendment <e> <s> and to bring up the issue again as the noble lord lord mcintosh has done is even odder <e> <s> the amendment proposes that after the bill becomes law there shall be a study carried on mainly for the purpose of continuing the controversies which we have had during discussion of the bill <e> <s> this is to be at the public expense as it is proposed that it should be done as a result of legislation <e> <s> it is an odd idea <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that supplementaries such as those posed by the noble lord lord hatch are not very helpful in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the fallacy that lies behind the argument for the amendments is the view specifically stated by the noble lord lord stewart that if one does not have to take the decisions by statutory instrument parliament can do nothing about it <e> <s> that is a complete fallacy <e> <s> if the secretary of state or any other minister does something wrong it is perfectly possible for either house of parliament to hold him to account <e> <s> if he does something wrong and scandalously wrong it can be drawn to the attention of a local member of another place or one of your lordships <e> <s> through ordinary parliamentary proceedings perhaps beginning with a parliamentary question it is perfectly possible to challenge a decision and bring it before parliament <e> <s> it is a fallacy to try to contrast decisions which have been taken by statutory instrument as therefore being subject to parliamentary control and decisions which do not require that as being immune from it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the second question asked by the noble lord is a long one and i shall take a long time to answer <e> <s> it depends upon the importance of the subject matter <e> <s> parliament has taken the view that matters above a certain degree of general importance should he subject to these procedures <e>", "<cs> public importance <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house how much of taxpayers money has been put into subsidising the continued operations of this yard over the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the motives behind this proposal and sympathise with the amendment but i feel that the second paragraph in particular would give rise to a great deal of trouble <e> <s> after all political representation in local authorities as elsewhere changes from time to time sometimes drastically <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the problem and the noble lord is probably right in suggesting that <e> <s> however if we put this into the bill we would give the incoming authority a very good pretext for the kind of action he describes <e> <s> authorities would say that they were only doing it to comply with the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dormand said that he had moved a similar amendment on report <e> <s> he was capped by the noble earl lord russell who said that this was the third time that this amendment had been discussed <e> <s> on the basis that they are right and i am sure they are i wish to enter a protest against the amendment being tabled on third reading <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite contrary to the practice of the house and of the use of the facility of having amendments on third reading to table again amendments which have been put down and discussed at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> the companion to the standing orders tells us very clearly the kind of amendment that is appropriate for third reading <e> <s> it certainly makes quite clear that the repetition of amendments which have been discussed and dealt with earlier is quite wrong on third reading <e> <s> it unduly prolongs the proceedings and begins to raise the issue as to whether the procedure committee should consider the whole question of whether amendments on third reading ought to be admitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i respond to the noble earl with this <e> <s> at the moment i am not concerned with his feelings or the merits of the matter i am merely concerned with the fact that he appears to be abusing the procedure of the house <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the high exchange rate to which reference has been made is an indication that foreign financial circles take a more cheerful and robust line about the british economy than certain gloomy noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and for making it clear that the government are not bound by the agreement between the then chairman of the british airports authority and the west sussex county council <e> <s> is he aware that some of his supplementary answers on llth may did not make that point clear <e> <s> my purpose in putting the question was to clear up that matter so that when the government of the day face the reality that a second runway must be built they will not be faced with any unnecessary obstacles <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there would be plenty of space if new ground were taken and that many people in the aviation world regard the white paper as now being completely out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy for once to be able to agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and to say how much i too welcome the concession which my noble friend has announced in respect of hostels <e> <s> i am sure it is a sensible decision and will do much good <e> <s> we shall come to the general matter of charities later but am sure that my noble friend has done the right thing as regards hostels <e> <s> i am sure as the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> said that noble lords in all parts of the house will welcome the concession a great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting reply <e>

long delays suffered by persons applying for passports or simply for renewal of them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to say whether the figures that he gave to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for the current period are better or worse than they were at the same time last year <e>", "<cs> my lords could there not be some alleviation of the suffering being imposed on air travellers this summer caused partly as my noble friend has said as a result of the tiresomeness of european air traffic controllers by relaxing night landing restrictions <e> <s> at heathrow and gatwick night landing restrictions could be relaxed to permit the landing of delayed flights whose scheduled time of arrival was in the daytime <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the point made by the noble lord lord peston simply an indication of the gross domestic product having risen so satisfactorily as a result of the economic policies of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords was my noble friend a little surprised when the noble lord opposite referred to profits rising drastically <e> <s> would it not be better to say satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that helpful reply perhaps i may ask him whether it means that in all cases in which an aircraft is delayed and as a result arrives on the approach after the time of closure it will be allowed to land at gatwick and not be diverted to other airports with consequent misery to passengers and threat to safety from an overtired crew <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend twice referred to permission to land after hours being granted where there had been widespread and prolonged delays <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that if you are a passenger or the crew of an aircraft which is behind time it

problems facing the commanding officer of a ship at war already in action with gunboats than any of them <e> <s> is it not correct that the view of the british government based upon that experience is entitled to great respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will as the noble earl has just said follow the advice of the right reverend prelate and accept this amendment <e> <s> the government have obviously made a considerable effort to meet the views which were expressed in your lordships house <e> <s> by introducing a system of two ballots i think they have met the very real danger which was mentioned at an earlier stage of a small group of zealots pushing a motion through in the absence of the great majority of parents <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> surely those are exactly the circumstances in which the secretary of state would refuse the application <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from what my noble friend has so

many films and television programmes as possible which are made in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that the other place has previously not raised the question of local expenditure or taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> the amendment is curious because it seeks to censure her majestys government for seeking to oppose the amendment not on its merits but on the grounds of commons financial privilege <e> <s> that is a curious reason for seeking to blame the government <e> <s>

seeking to make money by publishing immensely offensive observations about the founder of the christian faith <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the fact that the film to which reference has been made in several supplementary questions is not an exercise in free speech but a deliberate attempt to raise money by publishing offensive observations about the founder of the christian religion with the knowledge that they would be offensive and with no other motive than making money <e> <s> is he aware that many people feel that the law of blasphemy which he has defended is a pretty ineffective instrument if it cannot stop this <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a bad practice to table questions based on no better authority than a film <e>", "<cs> on the merits of the clause as described by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton i am wholly in favour <e> <s> however i rise only to support what my noble friend lord renton has said on the complexity and difficulty of

ennals seems to have read into this particular paragraph more than i was able to read into it <e> <s> i await with some interest what my noble friend the minister has to say <e> <s> the paragraph

users council which he quoted with approval to the effect that it would not object to the increase provided that efficiency was improved is the collorary that if efficiency is not improved and it shows no signs of being so the increase will be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend note that the views of the liberal party appear to be that as the citizen is not fit to use his own money he must have it taken away in taxation <e>", "<cs> congratulations my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government also aware of the effects of the dock labour scheme on the ports to which it applies <e> <s> in particular are they aware of the fact that over the past years whereas the number employed in non-scheme docks has more than doubled in docks covered by the scheme the number has fallen by more than half <e> <s> is that fact not some reason for the government to make up their mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of his answer to the noble lord lord mellish is my noble friend aware that there would not have been a need for a docklands scheme if the london docks had been preserved from the ravages of the dock labour scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem with the amendment while its general approach seems harmless is that it assumes that there can be no circumstances at all in which publication of the results of research could not be harmful to the public interest <e>

statement of this kind were not made <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend observed the desperate efforts being made by noble lords opposite to dispute the fall in unemployment <e> <s> can he explain it <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend notice that the right reverend prelate stated that the present situation of the law on sunday trading was chaotic <e> <s> in the light of that is it not for the government to give a lead to remedy a situation which puts the prosecuting authorities throughout the country in enormous difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord bruce of donington was quite right when he said that he had never heard a statement like this because he has never heard as good a statement as this or as encouraging a statement for the british public as a whole <e> <s> is he aware that the statement makes it clear that her majestys government while providing additional funds where they are really needed have kept an effective grip on public expenditure a fact that reflects great credit on the government as a whole and on the chief secretary to the treasury in particular <e> <s> is he aware also that many people will be very reassured to see this steady management of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether or not his european colleagues either at the october meeting or any other have indicated that they are seriously tackling the frequency of industrial disputes among their air traffic controllers which inflicted so much misery on our fellow citizens last summer <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is the ministers birthday i should have thought on the contrary that that was a reason for not pressing him too hard on an amendment particularly if i may be allowed to say so if it is a very odd amendment indeed <e> <s> the concept that a person who abstains from voting when a vote is taken can suddenly say three weeks later that he would like to vote is a novel one <e>", "<cs> if it applied at a parliamentary general election it might have startling consequences <e> <s> if it had applied in it might have resulted in a change in the decision of the electorate a week or two later

amounts to a second ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords in other words having declined to vote the first time he is effectively being given a second vote <e> <s> it is no use the noble lord lord seebohm

amendment he will see that it is not restricted to those unable to vote it deals also with those who do not vote which is a very much wider category <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by the noble lord lord carter is obviously well intentioned <e> <s> it is put forward against the dilemma which has confronted all your lordships at earlier stages of the bill when the discussion took place on the ability of disabled people to have equal rights with able-bodied people over the purchase of their homes <e> <s> there is a real dilemma <e> <s> either one discriminates in one way or another against the disabled or one risks reducing the stock of suitable accommodation for other disabled people <e> <s> there is no avoiding that dilemma although i believe the amendment is intended to seek to find a way of so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i put it to the noble lord that a house which can be disposed of to anybody must receive a higher market price than a house that can only be disposed of albeit otherwise a similar house to a limited category of people <e> <s> in other words the phrase market price has no meaning whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord mcintosh i think that this is a good bill <e> <s> i think that it must be a good bill to have been able to stand up to the bombardment to which it has been subjected notably by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>

fact that the bill has emerged virtually undamaged after being dealt with in the way he dealt with it is perhaps paradoxically an indication that it is a rather good bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this example show that such a public service should have a no-strike agreement and also that it is quite wrong for an organisation that does not have a no-strike agreement to have a statutory monopoly

effect <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford partly reminded us as long ago as not only the late mr bevan but also the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx resigned from the labour government

and definitely thrashed out particularly by my noble friend lady young <e> <s> it is quite clear that we should be acting contrary to the spirit of the constitution if we were to reject the commons

should be done or uses it merely as a form of reproach <e> <s> i rather understood his tone to be one of reproach with the suggestion that my noble friends to whom he referred had erred <e> <s> if that is so it is no argument that the offence should be repeated by the present opposition <e> <s> on the other hand if the noble lord is holding it out as an example of correct behaviour i <e>",

inducement to some of them to work abroad from where it may be difficult to recover the debt <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that there is a very considerable wish in all quarters of the house that this very important matter vital to all those who move about in london should be debated very early in the new session <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that not particularly incisive answer <e> <s> is he aware that the words of the question echo the resolution adopted at the conservative party conference <e> <s> is it not time that the government who have otherwise shown themselves to be courageously reforming tackled the mess <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the matter will my noble friend look at the example of scotland where they get on perfectly sensibly and effectively with total deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what the noble lord lord kilmarnock has just said will no doubt receive a reply on tuesday when your lordships house proceeds to discuss financial and economic matters <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will not think it discourteous if i revert to the general subjects for todays debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i said neither if the noble lord had been kind enough to listen to me <e> <s> i said that the sentences were eroded by the grant of parole <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord has taken the point now <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the peers to whom the noble lord has referred is an ancestor of mine <e> <s> i have an extremely good print of the scene of his execution on tower hill <e> <s> i also

from all underground stations while in service <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting answer <e> <s> is she aware of the fact that many people believe that the prolonged difficulties which have arisen owe a good deal to the action of her majestys government in not associating the government of gibraltar in the negotiations with spain but presenting them with a <e>",

gibraltar will be associated with them at the time and will not simply be given the results afterwards on a take it or leave it basis <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is the turn of this side <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the substantial payment to help the industry in its difficulties and the fact that the problem has been known for some time can my noble friend say whether or not the industry itself has taken initiatives to deal with the dangerous defects in its product some of which your lordships will rather painfully remember arose last may <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful reply <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that the present proposals of london transport and london underground provide for the necessary release mechanism involved in this apparatus being sited in the ticket office <e> <s> is he further aware that on many occasions from ones observations the ticket offices are not manned <e> <s> will my noble friend carefully bear these matters in mind since any government approving a scheme of this sort may be taking a very heavy responsibility indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to my noble friends answer to my noble friend behind me as regards the governments powers is it not the fact that the government appoint and can sack the board of london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a convention in debates such as this to begin by expressing gratitude to the mover <e> <s> however on this occasion it is a great deal more than a formality <e> <s> your lordships are much indebted to

handicap of its taking place on the eve of the christmas recess has produced a long list of speakers and an excellent attendance <e> <s> this is a debate well worth undertaking it was given a most brilliant start by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> that all sounded very simple and attractive but if you have a government which is in fact keeping control of public expenditure reducing a particular amount of taxation does not mean that taxation has to be imposed elsewhere <e> <s> that is a complete fallacy <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt again but does not the noble lord also have to consider whether it is not quite a good thing to encourage people at all levels to retain their home and continue to live in it and for their family to be able to do so afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend convey a very special expression of sympathy from this country to the families of those american <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord strathclyde on his rapid mastery of a bill with which yesterday he was no doubt not particularly concerned <e> <s> i thank him for the clear and helpful explanation which as a result he gave to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness lady jeger will not think it offensive if i say that her speech has fairly accurate precedents in debates of this kind over the past years <e> <s> when proposals for uprating social security benefits are discussed in either house the opposition always say that they are not good enough and do not go far enough and the government say on the contrary that they represent a considerable improvement on the previous position <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble baroness will not expect me to respond to her points because that is the job of the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has missed the point <e> <s> the retirement pension has never been means tested <e> <s> the point i am trying to make and i am sorry if i did not make it with sufficient clarity and i shall try again is that even the retirement pension a contributory benefit was in that era regarded as something

matter of concern to a very large number of people in this country who realise what we owe to the raf <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is not the efficiency of the postal service also a matter of concern for the government in view of the vital part it plays in the working of british life and the british economy <e> <s> if the government are not satisfied as to the efficiency of the post office are they prepared to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that contrary to the experience of the noble lord lord mottistone many letters come from this city to hampshire a distance of miles in two and a half days which works out at an average movement of one mile an hour <e>", "<cs> my lords are not comparisons with canada and australia somewhat absurd in the light of the enormous difference in the size of those countries and this one <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that comprehensive reply <e> <s> i ask whether it amounts to this that in general the government are not prepared to relax night landing restrictions save in difficulties and emergencies <e> <s> however they believe that they have some other method for dealing with the shortage of runways <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the air traffic control service at these airports perfectly satisfactorily operated at present <e>", "<cs> it was pleasant to hear the noble lord lord williams of elvel applauding the increase in wider share ownership <e> <s> it was particularly pleasant to hear it from those benches because that has not always been the theme of the labour party <e> <s> however when one comes to the specific proposals which he is putting forward i believe that he is probably somewhat exaggerating the significance of the subject matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the criticism made from the benches opposite of the introduction of the police is my noble friend aware that most people will feel that where one has a prison with a large number of dangerous people in it if the government in that situation had not called in the police they would rightly have been subject to censure <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not dismiss the point that the noble lord lord williams of elvel has put to him because it raises an echo in my mind and i guess that of a number of my noble friends <e> <s> outside consultation is a good thing but it happens from time to time i am afraid that on technical issues where there has been full outside consultation noble lords in all parts of this place are not consulted but are faced with approving or disapproving in most cases the conventionally cannot disapprove an order <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may support the appeal of the noble lord lord ennals to my noble friend for an early debate in your lordships house on this immensely important statement <e> <s> your lordships house has much to contribute and i think that it would be very

gap with only the august holiday between those holidays and christmas <e> <s> will the government announce a decision in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords while no one wishes to inhibit the noble baroness lady turner from dancing round the maypole to her hearts content is my noble friend aware that may day only very occasionally coincides with the may day holiday because of the provision that

football grounds in england had been no higher than according to him it has been in scotland this bill would have been necessary at all <e> <s> but of course as he himself said it has been a very different story <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who heard the noble lord lord graham of edmonton while not using the rather archaic hook line and sinker language which the noble lord lord mishcon

clear impression which he gave <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon may remember that his noble friend lord graham of edmonton said that the bill was an insult to the football clubs <e> <s> that was

experience show that a statutory framework for the protection of young workers is one of the best methods of securing that they suffer unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that under the present law alcohol can be freely sold on sundays <e> <s> that is clear from schedule to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords is the right reverend prelate then saying as i think he is that not only

much obliged to the right reverend prelate for his habitual courtesy <e> <s> when he says that the churches are consistent in this matter has he in mind the cathedral shops which as recently as last sunday all broke the law by selling goods prohibited by law <e> <s> is that consistency on the part of the deans and chapters of those cathedrals <e>", "<cs> my lords if the right reverend prelate invites me to intervene of course i accept <e> <s> i merely suggest to him that even if half of what he is saying is true at the end of the five-year period there would be such a revulsion that people would want to withdraw the practice <e> <s> however if what he is saying is not particularly convincing he would be right and it would not be reversed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend asking me a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to him at once that i think that the speed limit on motorways should be enforced and that it is the fault and i say this in the presence of the minister of the home office that there are insufficient motorway police <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that it cannot be enforced <e> <s> if my noble friend has ever travelled on united states highways where incidentally the speed limit is mph he will see that it is very rigidly and effectively enforced <e> <s> if the americans can enforce mph i do not see why we if we put in sufficient manpower cannot enforce mph <e>", "<cs> five million <e>", "<cs> my lords happily for me and your lordships it is the convention that in the last speech of this kind of debate the mover is not expected to make a serious or substantial attempt to reply to the points raised <e> <s> if that were the convention then your lordships would be in for a very late sitting indeed <e> <s> as it is our main duty is to thank noble lords of all points of view for taking part in the debate and for contributing to what i hope from the point of view of your lordships house and of the minister has been a very useful exchange of views <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is a service in st albans <e> <s> i was however a little reassured by the fact that i had the pleasure of bringing out the following to your lordships <e> <s> whatever line the right reverend prelates may take on this matter the deans and chapters of at any rate a <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the rest proposals or those of any other body may achieve we exist at the moment under the present law <e> <s> i was gathering reassurance from the fact that the present law is so manifestly silly that whatever approach the right reverend prelates may make the deans and chapters of a large number of cathedrals are far more practical <e> <s> they are far more into the contemporary scene and the contemporary approach and are even prepared to carry their trading practices to the point of transgressing the criminal law <e> <s> that is still the point <e> <s> whether one accepts the rest proposals personally i do not although i shall not waste time on that now or those of any other organisation is irrelevant to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case can my noble friend give an assurance that there will not in the future be cases such as there have been in the recent past of trawlers coming in with cargos of fish being forbidden because this is a dock labour port to land them themselves and being forced to take their rapidly decaying fish to other ports <e> <s> can we have an assurance that that will not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will inform the noble lord lord mellish that i have often suggested the abolition of the dock labour scheme and that sometimes it is helpful when so doing to draw attention to particular examples where it is causing mischief <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether any local authorities are still obstructing or delaying the sale of council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the uprating of the national insurance retirement pension is an enormous operation covering many millions of people that it is quite impossible to alter it at the last minute and that any attempt to do so would only cause confusion and hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the quality of the aid programme to which my noble friend referred do the government take into account the fact that in certain countries the aid provided at the cost of the british taxpayer is wasted notably in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that where a business desires to appeal against the valuation of its premises in the list the procedure for appealing will be the same as at <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the position of chief constables are the government not concerned at the reduction both in absolute terms and in proportion to the regular police in the number of special constables <e> <s> are the government not concerned to reverse that trend <e> <s> if my noble friend has any difficulty

hooliganism the limited number of police available are able to arrest only a small proportion of the malefactors <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had given way a moment earlier he would have saved

released before the termination of his sentence <e> <s> is he also aware of the fact that within a matter of months he had committed the murder of a married woman for which he has again been sentenced

lords if the prison rules demand the release of a man known to be dangerous is it not time that they were reconsidered and further thought given to the protection of the public which the learned judge who tried the case thought he had given <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is right and he is more likely to be right than the noble lord lord mishcon is there not a very strong case when one is dealing with dangerous characters who have already inflicted serious injury and from whom the public have a right to be protected for the prison rules which apparently produce this situation to be urgently reviewed <e>", "<cs> as between the two noble earls i found myself in agreement with the minister and i think my noble friend lord selkirk very conscientiously has somewhat exaggerated the difficulty of proving the lack of knowledge which is required by the subsection <e> <s> as i understand it someone who desired to rest on this defence would go into the witness box and say on oath that he did not know <e> <s> he would then be cross-examined and there would be put to him various circumstances which the prosecution might thick should have made him known or suspect <e> <s> he

of the european court of human rights <e>", "<cs> exactly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he referred to the europeancourt of human rights <e>", "<cs> or the court of justice as the referee and said that it was wrong to be flippant about it <e> <s> however the noble lord must face the fact that that court has not had a very successful record <e> <s> there are

water bill until it comes to us <e>", "<cs> my lords for almost the first time in my life i can happily agree with something said by the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> it was the remark made in his concluding sentences <e> <s> i agree that the churches are coming together and that it has ceased to be the case that one church regards it as a merit or virtue to criticise another <e> <s> that will strengthen the hold of the christian religion on the public and undoubtedly it will help in the matter now before your lordships <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot agree with much more that the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e> <s> i have always noticed that the noble earl is enormously thoughtful and considerate towards the needs and well-being of the criminal <e> <s> however i have noticed much less concern expressed on his part about the effect on the victim <e> <s> he has always concentrated on the well-being of those who have committed crimes many of them serious crimes <e>

is right <e> <s> i remember his bill <e> <s> with respect it was not an effective measure nor one which had the slightest chance of becoming law as he knew perfectly well <e> <s> i repeat that his manifest concern is often expressed for people who have committed atrocious crimes and it is well known in this house <e> <s> it appears to me to detract from the balance of his remarks when dealing with this subject <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to intervene i shall give way if he does not mind taking second place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> that does not alter in the slightest the fact that over the years it is years since then the noble earl has distinguished himself by continually raising the question of the convicted criminal <e> <s> he did so this afternoon when he stated that the governments penal policy was flawed because it suggested longer sentences <e> <s> i shall deal with that matter in a moment because i believe that his reasoning on it is also flawed

government under a previous act <e> <s> all that i asked was that after that illustration of the effect of those regulations and in those circumstances the government should at least reconsider the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that singularly uninformative answer <e> <s> is the ignorance which is shown by government of the situation in respect of sunday shopping

aware that the right reverend prelate is an inconvertible security <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that somewhat ambiguous reply <e> <s> is it not quite ridiculous to compel an aircraft which has just taken off on a transatlantic flight to land within a few miles of the point of take-off <e> <s> is he aware that that compulsion according to the airlines adds some two additional take-offs and landings with all the safety considerations involved and adds three hours to the time of the round trip <e> <s> what is the point of a government which believes in free enterprise imposing a nonsense of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it is not a question of whether airlines use airports other than prestwick in scotland <e> <s> air is already using glasgow <e> <s> this is a question of whether he does prestwick any service by making it compulsory to call there ridiculously close to the point of origin <e>", "<cs> my lords surely

separation of the may day holiday from easter <e> <s> is the minister aware that one can increase that separation by moving either of them <e>", "<cs> this seems a rather surprising amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asks for indications to be given of the action that would be taken in certain circumstances by the security service <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will not give such indications because they would be a matter of very great interest to various activists outside this country who might well like to know what kind of response their machinations might produce from the security service <e> <s> surely the essence of the work of the security service is that those against whom it operates should not have advance warning <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord annan and one or two of those who have spoken from the other side of the committee do not seem to have had fully in mind what is proposed in the amendment <e> <s> there has been a tendency to play down the role of the proposed committee <e> <s> i should like to remind the committee of what the amendment proposes to insert into the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall tell the noble lord why not <e> <s> indeed i am much obliged to him because i was just about to explain <e> <s> exclusive power is so given <e> <s> in my view there are certain matters affecting the security of the

lord attlee i mean the first earl a decision was taken to build a british nuclear bomb <e> <s> that fact was completely and in my view wholly justifiably concealed from parliament and the public because it was thought by those responsible the then labour government that that was in the interests of the state <e> <s> surely that is a good example of the fact that in this unhappy world in which we live with all the violence and all the strange movements which take place in it there are certain matters which are best known only to the service and to the responsible ministers of the crown <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with the intervention first <e> <s> the noble lord made a wholly inaccurate statement when he said that during the government of mr attlee as he then was but he subsequently became earl attlee the country was in a state of war <e> <s> it was not <e>", "<cs> during the six years of that labour government this country was in fact at peace <e> <s> therefore that argument is founded on a complete mis-statement <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will understand that i quoted that as an example of the fact that there are certain matters vital to the security of this country which cannot and should not be disclosed outside the machine of government <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend observe that the noble lord lord underhill speaking from the opposition front bench referred to the move of labour from a nationalised to a privatised industry <e> <s> has my noble friend any comment to make on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill referred to british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure the house that in the publicity which his department handles in this matter the alternative of deferring retirement and thereby earning an incremented pension will be clearly put before those to whom this concession would otherwise apply so that they are not excited by it into doing what might not be in their case in their best interests <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hatch suggested that some of us on this side of the house thought that ministers were always right <e> <s> let me assure him as one who has served in one house of parliament or another since the war that i know very many examples to the contrary though i shall spare the blushes of certain noble lords by refusing to enumerate them <e> <s> there

responsibility for the safety of the realm <e> <s> they have a very special responsibility as my noble friend lord pym put it so well a few moments ago <e> <s> there is great danger in trying to wean away to whittle away that responsibility which properly falls on ministers and ministers only <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to enter into a discussion of the arrangements in other countries <e> <s> we are now concerned with the proper arrangements which are to be made here <e> <s> it is more than possible that some of the countries which he has in mind are being extremely unwise and are endangering their security <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> let us suppose that something of that kind were happening now <e> <s> who believes that a judge and jury are competent to form a view on the immensely important and difficult question of whether it would be in the public interest that such an issue should be disclosed <e> <s> now i shall certainly give way to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i suppose that the noble lord is entitled to that belief however fantastic <e> <s> if one could find anything more relevant to a charge of abuse of authority or neglect of duty than the question of this countrys manufacture of nuclear <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has challenged my own experience i must state that he omitted the fact that for a number of years i was also chief secretary to the treasury <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord grimond in his usual agreeable way indicated the view which he takes rather generally on the bill <e> <s> i hope the committee will allow me to confine my few remarks to the amendment <e> <s> here we are concerned with damage to the work of or any part of the security and intelligence services <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the solution to be found in encouraging british coal to become more competitive <e>", "<cs> i hope that in this serious matter the committee will accept the advice given by two members of the committee who have the greatest practical experience of the subject matter with which these amendments deal <e> <s> i refer to my noble friend lord home and to the noble lord lord hankey <e>", "<cs> i do not share the uncritical enthusiasm that my noble friend lord renton has for the noble lord lord mishcon and his argument <e> <s> i believe that the point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon on this occasion is simple <e> <s> although he did not say so the effect of his amendment is to weaken the clause which has been the effect of several previous amendments moved from that side of the committee <e> <s> if one has only to prove that the interests of the united kingdom have been jeopardised as i understand it one has to mean that they have been threatened <e> <s> it does not mean that actual damage must have occurred <e> <s> if one puts into the bill the words proposed in the amendment as i read them it would mean that a mere threat to the interests of the united kingdom would not be sufficient <e> <s> in order to constitute the offence damage must be visible and have been caused <e> <s> that is a substantial weakening of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will not be surprised to know that those of us who have been pressing for this change for some years are delighted to hear the statement this afternoon and to know that the government are acting and acting with characteristic promptness in introducing a bill forthwith <e>", "<cs> my lords secondly it is enormously depressing to hear from the noble baroness that labour party thinking on industrial matters has not moved for years <e>", "<cs> my lords has the civil aviation authority already advised her majestys government that an additional runway will be required in the south-east of england before the end of the century and that therefore time is now running short for the preparatory work <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend point out to the noble lord lord underhill that there is a <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start again <e> <s> will my noble friend point out to the noble lord lord underhill that there is a very close relationship between airspace and runway capacity and that shortage of runway capacity accentuates shortage of airspace <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct when he says that the attitude of many of us to this amendment is to some extent affected by which side of the house one happens to be sitting <e> <s> that is natural and true <e> <s> this is the kind of amendment that is moved in more or less the same terms to most major bills <e> <s> it is also true that the many and complex problems raised by this bill will undoubtedly give rise to the making of a great many statutory instruments by ministers of the crown whoever they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords that may possibly be the case <e> <s> however if that is so it is a case for an amendment to that effect being moved in the house which believes that it will benefit from it and not for your lordships to be so maternal towards another place as to seek to provide for it <e> <s> even if the noble lord is right and i have had some experience in another place and think he somewhat exaggerates surely that is their business <e>", "<cs> forty sitting days <e>", "<cs> my lords that is interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only a question of the foreigner <e> <s> the foreigner who genuinely did not understand the matter would almost certainly be gently and leniently treated by any court <e> <s> the amendment goes much further <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to provide that the attempt to

tries to defy the intentions of parliament and in the process gives an enormous amount of trouble to those concerned with the security of the grounds should commit no offence <e> <s> as i understand it that would be the effect of accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be patient for a moment <e> <s> my only surprise as my noble friend lord renton said is that the maximum sentence is so moderate <e> <s> one month is not in many ways a very sensible sentence to impose <e> <s> its shortness is perhaps a factor against its deterrent effect <e> <s> but the general principle that in an extreme case a persistent offender could be sent to prison is an important part of the bill <e> <s> now i shall certainly give way <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not legislating for

us who agree with the governments view against widening the scope of clamping because clamping perpetuates obstruction would nonetheless like to see severe penalties being imposed for use of unlicensed vehicles <e> <s> has consideration been given to confiscating such vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does it not strike him as rather odd that you

happening know that he himself played a major part in bringing about this particular investment <e> <s> this country should therefore feel great gratitude towards him for that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the public interest defence has been exhaustively and one might say exhaustingly discussed at a number of stages of the bill both in this house and in another place <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon rather despairingly put it in his speech this is its last ditch <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that because in the circumstances he described of a civil servant at the ministry of defence it might not be possible to prevent serious matters being disclosed there is therefore no point in protecting information where it is most vulnerable of all that is in the secret service <e>", "<cs> my lords one sees what the noble and learned lord is seeking to achieve by means of the amendment <e> <s> indeed it is perfectly open to him or to any of your lordships to argue that once secret information has been widely disclosed there may not be much point in proceeding against further disclosures <e> <s> but as against that argument it suggests that if someone commits a breach of security and gets away with it to a modest degree that person is entitled to publish as much as he likes everywhere and no one can do anything about it <e> <s> in other words if you commit a modest offence you should have free licence to commit as much more of the same offence as you wish <e> <s> i am not sure that that is an attractive aspect of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will

disseminated from there is much greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say because my noble friend lord renton appears to have made a point of some significance and drawn attention to what appears to be a deficiency in the bill <e> <s> his amendment could instead have simply proposed to delete the word abroad in lines and which would have had the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the one point on which all noble lords present will agree is that of gratitude to my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for opening the debate and giving us the opportunity to discuss the most important matter in the world today <e> <s> if we do not resolve the problems of maintaining international peace nothing else that we do such as the social reforms and economic developments of which we may be proud will matter very much <e> <s> my noble friend speaks with unique authority and he gave the debate a wonderful start <e>", "<cs> my lords it must have

union aids and abets but does not organise a strike it can get away with it without a ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the questions from the opposition front bench can my noble friend say whether there is any evidence that the relevant trade union did anything to discourage the strike action which caused untold misery on two occasions to hundreds of thousands of people <e>", "<cs> my

my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware of the fact that the tax on someones personal home given the very high valuation based on house property at the moment is often a serious blow to an individual at a particularly difficult time <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be in accordance with the governments policy of encouraging a nation of home owners to make a concession here <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards my noble friends argument about narrowing the tax base is it not a fact that capital gains tax is excluded in the case of a principal home <e> <s> will the minister not agree that that is a very good precedent for dealing similarly with the inheritance tax <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the answer which he has repeated is in a considerable degree reassuring but that some noble lords would like him to go a little further and indicate that it is the governments intention that in the outcome this immensely interesting relic of

of us have as to the importance historically and aesthetically of this site it offers a considerable contribution to our tourist industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend and his right

tendency of modern legislation in respect of length that in moving the second reading of the bill my noble friend lord henley should say that a bill which in fact includes clauses and nine schedules many of them massive was not a very long bill <e> <s> compared with some other measures with which your lordships house has to deal that is of course relatively true but it is a substantial bill and

lords perhaps i may ask the noble earl to clear up one point on the interesting and important matter to which he referred of the right and duty of the home secretary to veto the grant of a licence in certain circumstances <e> <s> i understood him to say that the ground for exercising the veto would be that the source of finance for the applicant was inappropriate <e> <s> does that mean a source of finance perhaps from an unfriendly foreign power or does it go wider and involve a judgment about sources of finance in this country for example those concerned with very low grade entertainment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain why it is that the forthcoming dissolution of ilea should suddenly make these playing fields surplus to requirements when they have been needed over the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that merely to say that the rate of decline has reduced is not particularly encouraging to those of us who greatly care about the decline in

second reading speeches <e> <s> this type of amendment makes that quite inevitable <e> <s> this is simply a proposal to reconstruct the dock labour scheme and put it in place of the one that the bill abolishes <e> <s> if one is to discuss it it must be discussed in very much the same terms as was the original scheme <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord mccarthy i am interested in the likely duration of the transitional period <e> <s> i shall be very grateful if my noble friend on the front bench can give some indication of the governments attitude <e> <s> where i differ from the noble

removal of a member of the board should be by statutory instrument and moreover by statutory instrument subject to the affirmative procedure appears to make very heavy weather indeed of the issue <e>

minister but it seems a most extraordinary proposition that it should be done in the full blaze of publicity of an affirmative order which may be argued about <e> <s> in the course of that argument the board members personal characteristics and suitability might well be dragged in <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the delays in the issuing of passports and the consequent gross inconvenience to the public which considerably preceded the industrial action taken by the passport office staff are accentuated by the insistence on the rule that the holder of a perfectly good passport with plenty of space still left is compelled to turn it in for destruction and replacement simply because he has held it for years <e> <s> is he aware that the situation could be eased

regards the two by-elections in one seat which the labour party already held the majority went slightly up and in the other went slightly down <e> <s> what conclusions does my noble friend draw from that <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that as long ago as the publication of the conservative party manifesto for the general election it was contemplated that action would be taken to deal with strikes in public services which hurt the public <e> <s> in view of what is now happening and the hardship that is being imposed on millions of our fellow countrymen by the irresponsible and selfish action of the strikers is there not a good case for proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to prolong to some degree the transitional period after the bill has become enacted <e> <s> surely there must be in your lordships minds some doubt as to whether that is a good thing <e> <s> certainly the sooner the industry gets through the change and settles down on a long-term basis that is the sooner it gets through the transitional period the better for all concerned for the prosperity of the industry and for the opportunities of those who work in it <e> <s> therefore i look with a certain degree of apprehension at an amendment which however well-intentioned its purposes obviously they are very well-intentioned will delay the full implementation of the bill when it becomes enacted and which will further prolong the transitional period which may in any event take a little time <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e> <s> but in the case of the docks it does not apply to all those who work in them it applies only to the registered dock worker section of those who work in the docks <e> <s> therefore the noble baronesss argument with the greatest respect to her does not take her very far <e> <s> indeed i shall continue my argument having been stimulated by her intervention <e> <s> she said that dock work is dangerous <e> <s> of course it has dangers <e> <s> but many other industries are dangerous for example building mining and aviation to name but a few <e> <s> if this proposal is put forward on the grounds of danger i suggest to the noble baroness that there is no case whatever for singling out a minority of dock workers and giving them special additional provision which is not given to their fellow citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords it may have the effect of setting a standard for the industry <e> <s> the standard was no doubt much appreciated by those who had the advantage of it <e> <s> but with great respect that is no argument for continuing to set a special standard for an industry which itself contains only a small minority of workers <e> <s> what justification does the noble baroness see for creating or continuing in this case those special privileges <e>", "<cs> the lower reaches <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the characteristically courteous manner in which he has given way <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he realises that while all that he has been most eloquently saying may have an application to registered dock workers he is at the same time seeking to justify a discrimination against that majority of people now working in the docks who are not registered dock workers <e> <s> how does he justify that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish has completely misunderstood the earlier speeches <e> <s> to my knowledge i have attended the whole of the discussion no one said that it was a scandal that good medical attention should be available for a particular section <e> <s> i said and the noble lord did not question it that the health and safety at work act which i suppose he supported because it was a labour governments act had since the introduction of the dock labour scheme altered the situation by providing a basic provision in this respect covering industry as a whole and that this was a far more satisfactory provision than seeking to preserve the remains of an older scheme limited to a certain number of people <e> <s> that seems to make a good deal of sense <e> <s> i hope that it does so now to the noble lord lord mellish <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give himself the boredom of reading my speech tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble lord attributed part of the parentage of his amendment to me i hope that he will not think me ungrateful if i say that as a matter of drafting the amendment reads very oddly <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i did not say a word about that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a rather odd proposition <e> <s> it is that the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that not particularly informative answer <e> <s> does he recall that as recently as th may his right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport addressing the scottish conservative party conference said <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend explain to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that the restriction does not reduce in any way the number of flights leaving glasgow airport but merely impedes the operation of them <e> <s> is he aware that prestwick being as he said a very fine airport can only be damaged by the compulsory imposition of a stop on an airline which does not wish to stop there <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will look sympathetically at this amendment <e> <s> i doubt whether it is technically sound but it seems to me to be based on quite an important social point <e> <s> obviously one will listen to what he says but i hope that he will indicate appreciation of the situation which occurs when someone dies and the carer suddenly finds himself or herself left alone in the world <e> <s> it is on the whole very much in the public and private interest that such care should be given <e>", "<cs> the problem with all social security legislation and your lordships will perhaps know that i have some experience of that is that one deals item by item with the various aspects of it <e> <s> it is always possible only too easy to make a powerful strongly emotional case sometimes a strong intellectual case for the particular proposition which is being debated <e> <s> on the other hand the minister has the responsibility of looking at all the various directions in which the now vast expenditure on social security goes and trying to work out his priorities <e> <s> without expressing very strong opinion on this amendment i should with great respect say to your lordships that if one is to consider this responsibly one must look at it not merely on its own merits but also in comparison with and in relation to the very large number of other matters that the committee and people outside are discussing where there is a perfectly good case to be made for improvement <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down has he the figures for the cost of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the views on the merits of this bill no one can fail to be affected perhaps even moved by the strong feeling which it has aroused among a number of noble lords opposite and most notably the noble lord lord mellish and the noble baroness lady turner who spoke with real emotion understanding and sincerity <e> <s> noble lords will also recall at a previous stage the fine speech made by the noble lord lord callaghan who came to the house specially for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the minister to say why <e> <s> however if i may respond to the noble lords invitation which i always do most willingly i might add one or two reasons <e> <s> as he said i have for some years been convinced that the dock <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for very good reasons <e> <s> it is because of the type of cargoes and business that they deal with <e> <s> it is quite impossible to measure productivity in the conventional way one against another <e> <s> however what is striking and the noble lord must admit this is the way in which they have grown and the way in which traffic in them has grown compared with the decline in the scheme ports <e> <s> that is indisputable <e> <s> given that it would have been quite wrong for the government to allow the dock labour scheme to go on <e> <s> it had outlived its usefulness <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord talks of guillotines i must recall to a former labour chief whip in the house of commons that the use of the guillotine has never been confined to governments of one particular colour <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord could speak on the guillotine with great expertise as he applied it often <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of opinionwhen i was in the commons i thought that practically all the measures to which the noble lord applied the guillotine were absolute nonsense <e> <s> indeed the noble lord may recall that not only did i think that but i said so on many of them <e> <s> if the noble lord looks back he will find that i was right <e> <s> it is quite absurd to try to distort the argument on this by referring to the guillotine in particular when that point is sought to be made by someone who was a singularly skilful and vigorous exponent of the guillotine when he filled the relevant office <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see the point of the amendment in the light of the speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> the noble lord opposite said that such matters would need treasury approval anyhow whether or not it was in the bill <e> <s> therefore the proposal would not make a pennyworth of practical difference <e> <s> on the other hand it is the practice in similar statutes and the noble lord cannot brush this aside to lay down that where we are concerned with the manpower arrangements of central government and attached organisations the approval of the treasury is required <e> <s> it seems strange in this bill to omit that provision unless there were some intention that the situation should be different from that under other bills <e> <s> therefore the amendment appears pointless <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say something about this committee of experts <e> <s> for example who are the members and in what are they expert <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always admired the ingenuity of the noble lord lord mcintosh but he has excelled himself this afternoon <e> <s> he began with the very proper affirmation that he did not favour this house getting into conflict with another place by a direct rejection of its views and insistence on an amendment which it had rejected <e> <s> he then sought to justify this amendment in a very curious way by references to a meeting in brussels which he himself described as a non-meeting and whose relevance to this discussion would therefore seem to be a trifle tenuous <e> <s> he further suggested that what the commission was talking about at the moment was a reason for a very last minute amendment to the bill <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that international discussions on matters of this kind need to take time <e> <s> to try on the pretext of their relevance to slip in a further amendment to a bill in its final stage is a misuse of language <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that noble lords opposite say hear hear <e> <s> i am glad to carry them with me <e> <s> that was the real purpose of the earlier amendment and that is the purpose of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me a question and perhaps i can answer it <e> <s> the great discouragement to investors would be this proposal with its slow and cumbrous demand for an investment plan totally different from what would be in the ordinary sensible prospectus either in the private or the public sector <e> <s> the noble lord knows that perfectly well <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will appreciate the great care and trouble he has taken to consider the representations made to him on this matter not least in the debate in this house a week or two ago <e> <s> is he also aware that many of us will warmly welcome his decision to reject the monopolies and mergers commissions proposal for the compulsory divestment of a large number of public houses by the major brewers with all the confusion and difficulty that that would have caused particularly in country districts <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain why the soviet union which is a land mass with very little dependence on sea communications thinks it requires a navy of this size <e>", "<cs> my lords to my mind the amendment illustrates vividly the difficulty which your lordships house is in in discussing one by one amendments to the bill <e> <s> plainly on its merits it excites the sympathy of all your lordships in all parts of the house <e> <s> as the noble lord lord allen of abbeyfield with his skill in advocacy brought out it is comparatively small in its financial impact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i was in the wrong field <e> <s> dales are of course far more fertile <e> <s> as the noble lord brought out the impact is comparatively small <e> <s> therefore it seems an easy matter for your lordships to consider

said or indeed what i intended to say was that the opcs would give us the whole picture and it would then be for the government and parliament to decide in the light of that action what changes if any

regularly indeed <e> <s> it is good news for our country and in particular for those who are still unemployed and are being offered increasing opportunities for jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble

was one of those who spoke against the amendment when it was in your lordships house <e> <s> despite or perhaps because of my opposition it was duly carried <e> <s> that does not prevent me from understanding the strong feelings of those who supported it and who feel strongly about the matter when they find that it has come up against the barrier of commons privilege <e> <s> it is only human when one has been keen on a proposal and when one believes as many noble lords on both sides do that it would have been an improvement in our social security system had it been carried into law to feel strongly about the matter <e> <s> but we are up against one of the major features of our constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords they have accepted so many <e> <s> i do not propose to weary your lordships by reciting the work of the past few years <e> <s> it would be a waste of everyones time because the fact that another place has accepted our amendments is surely not an argument against it because in this case it has decided to reject them <e> <s> it is fully entitled by long-standing constitutional practice to reverse our decisions where they involve substantial expenditure <e> <s> that has been indisputably the position for a great many years <e> <s> it serves little purpose and <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate very little has been said about the constitutional position because in the debate on the previous amendment there was general acceptance whether noble lords liked it or not that the commons was clearly within its rights <e> <s> therefore on this occasion i shall not say anything on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply am ito understand from it that her majestys government now accept that an additional runway or additional runways will be required in the south east by the end of the century <e> <s> in view of the long time that it takes from a decision to a runway becoming operational can my noble friend say what the government are doing about it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend regard his suggestion that the views of the caa are not yet known on this matter as consistent with the letter dated th july from the chairman of the civil aviation authority to the secretary of state in which it is clearly stated that the caa has already indicated its view that there is a need for a new runway in the south east <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend add a little to her answer to the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> as i understood my noble friend she said that the extent of these costs had only recently come to light <e> <s> can she explain how that could be <e> <s> as i understood her earlier answers many of these costs go back a great many years <e> <s> surely the government system of accounting took account of them <e> <s> they must have been available to her department and to ministers <e> <s> can my noble friend explain why only at this very late stage the existence has come to light of these large liabilities which require to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i also begin by congratulating my noble friend lord caithness on the front bench on an extremely well deserved promotion <e> <s> those of us who have seen him in action on the legislation of this session know what an adroit and effective parliamentarian he is <e> <s> it is very good indeed to see that ability and hard work recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> consumption of course was reduced in under the measures taken as a result of the pressure from the imf <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that computerisation is very often used as an excuse for increased inefficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who have direct experience of the treasury very much resent the suggestion made by the noble lord lord bruce that the officials of that great department would produce accounts other than the most accurate possible <e> <s> will he repudiate very firmly the suggestions of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord gave us as he always does a most interesting tour of this part of the law <e> <s> i am sure that no member of the committee could have listened to him without learning quite a lot about the working of the system <e> <s> for that i for one am grateful <e> <s> however the amendment is quite specific and arises on only one point <e> <s> it seeks to transfer to the local authority the decision as to whether or not clause to which the committee has not yet come shall apply in a particular case <e> <s> apart from anything else it seems procedurally difficult in that way to pre-empt a considerable part of clause which the committee will no doubt want to discuss on its merits <e> <s> it seems objectionable on the assumption that clause stands that what parliament sees fit to enact as part of the law of the land should be subject to suspension on the whim of a local authority <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord wilt allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said that a ratepayer could challenge misuse of the power <e> <s> however the power is very wide <e> <s> it is a question of the opinion of the local authority <e> <s> of course if the opinion were plainly crazy that could be challenged but opinion is a fairly loose test and if the local authority says that it honestly believes that hardship will be caused it is unlikely that any court would upset that decision <e> <s> it is an extremely wide power <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will i think agree that there is a misprint in the first line of paragraph bb of amendment no <e> <s> a as it appears on the marshalled list <e> <s> should it not read contractors and not contracts <e>", "<cs> the only other point that i have is whether in the case of a very small job the amendment in doing away with the discretion of the local authority to waive the demand for two separate estimates which i understand is its effect might exclude the very small builder <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say about that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord a simple question <e> <s> if neither of the two builders who has submitted estimates wishes to undertake the work what happens <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps the noble lord will say what the point is of putting these words into the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee was reasonably happy with the statement made by my noble friend the minister on the earlier batch of amendments that he wished to have an opportunity to consider and consult on the points which arose on them <e> <s> for that reason i was not going to say anything specific on most of them but i should like to enter a reservation against the proposal which has just been spoken to on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> that moves from disability in its various forms with <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend enlighten me as to what useful result is expected from this widespread prosecution other than the provision of full employment for lawyers <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend and her majestys government indicate to the commission that very little useful purpose is served by the initiation of prosecutions of this kind and that goodwill and the effective working of the ec would be helped if they would drop this kind of behaviour and settle down to peaceful co-operation <e>", "<cs> i understand the difficulty faced by my noble friend the paymaster general <e> <s> he is in obvious difficulty in dealing with legislation from a department of which he is not a member <e> <s> i have listened to the whole of the debate and i think that my noble friend realises the very wide spread of opinion held on all sides of the committee that there should if at all possible be some legislative provision to deal with the position of tenants so placed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will welcome the adaptations and adjustments that the government have made to this system in response to the representations which they received from all quarters <e> <s> in particular i welcome the cutting down of the safety net provisions to one year <e> <s> as my noble friend knows they were deeply criticised as going against the whole spirit of the community charge proposals <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble friend on the front bench said a few moments ago as to the intentions of the government and in view of the fact that one incident of charging has arisen can my noble friend tell me what harm would be done by putting this amendment into the bill <e> <s> he did not make any criticism of its drafting <e> <s> he appears to accept its intention <e> <s> what harm would be done by putting it in <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a certain lack of logic among the supporters of the amendment <e> <s> to argue that demographic developments are going to mean as they are the need for the employment of more women and at the same time to argue that in those circumstances one must provide additional advantages or protection for employed women seems to be quite illogical <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should face the fact that if there is a great demand for womens labour for that very reason there is less need to protect their rights of employment <e>", "<cs> the case which arises as regards this matter is a difficult one <e> <s> i think many noble lords will very much share the feelings so eloquently expressed by my noble friend lady macleod of borve <e> <s> it must be a frightful shock for the person who has innocently acquired this disease to find that he is also quite apart from the physical injury he is likely to suffer going to be in difficulty as regards employment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton in a speech which lasted minutes made very clear his dislike of clauses and <e> <s> if he will allow me to say so he made a speech which might have been even more appropriate either on the motion that these clauses stand part of the bill or indeed on second reading <e> <s> he expressed his views with his usual clarity and force <e> <s> i hope he will not mind my saying that it sometimes gives me an ironic pleasure to see the spokesman for the labour party from that front bench making so powerful a speech against legislative change <e> <s> conservatism spelt with a small c is of course the current mark of the labour party and this was certainly a very good example <e>", "<cs> the point which i feel with respect that the noble lord is not wholly aprehending is that what he is suggesting is that there should be legislation enacted by parliament and granted royal assent and then if certain people outside do not like it the secretary of state in some mysterious way should be able to cancel it <e> <s> i am suggesting to him that that is not procedurally the way for parliament to proceed <e>", "<cs> that has nothing to do with the amendment <e>", "<cs> even if there is a case for investigation of health and safety in the mines the effect of the amendment i think this is its true purpose is simply to delay implementation of the first three subsections of clause <e> <s> a royal commission is not exactly a speedy means of proceeding <e> <s> i suppose that on average something like three years from its appointment to the production of its report would be expected <e> <s> for those three years the whole operation of the first three subsections of the clause would be held up <e>", "<cs> this amendment has one rather curious aspect inasmuch as it equates the health and safety commission and the equal opportunities commission with the secretary of state in the making of regulations <e>", "<cs> this clause is a very important part of the bill and represents what seems to me to be a most courageous decision on the part of the government to sweep away the mass of obsolete or obsolescent legislation which up to now has inhibited and made more difficult the employment of the younger generation <e> <s> however it is a mistake one which i think the noble lord lord rochester made to believe that if you do away with the legal restrictions upon the hours which <e>", "<cs> my noble friend did not mention it but i believe that we are taking amendments nos <e> <s> and with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i disagree with the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon when he says that other people will resent this concession to the sikhs sense of religion <e> <s> i do not believe that ordinary decent people in this country will fail to understand that this is a concession to a sincerely held religious view <e> <s> most of us certainly i speak for myself greatly respect people who take their religion sufficiently seriously to adopt this line <e> <s> they must be aware of the increased risk of injury to themselves in the event of an accident <e> <s> they have apparently weighed this up and have come to the conclusion that their duty to their religion their faith in it demands that they should not wear a helmet <e> <s> the government are right to accept that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i share my noble friends lack of general enthusiasm for referenda <e> <s> however is he aware that on a subject that is specifically left to the individual judgment of members of another place and this house without any advice from their parties there is a special case for ascertaining for the guidance of those people what in fact is the opinion of our fellow countrymen <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware as the noble lord lord mishcon does not appear to be that when it came to the decisions to which he referred another place did not have the advantage of knowing what the view of the public was <e> <s> is he also aware that there is some evidence that recent events notably bombings and the shooting of policemen have had an appreciable effect on public opinion on this difficult issue <e>", "<cs> as always the noble lord lord callaghan has crystallised the issue and put it forward with his habitual clarity <e> <s> however his reasoning does not lead me to the same conclusion as it appears to lead him <e> <s> as i understand it what we are concerned with here is not just time off but time off paid for by the employer namely time <e>", "<cs> i think with respect that the noble baroness has somewhat exaggerated the effect of the clause <e> <s> i am sure she is quite wrong to read into it such governmental intentions as she apparently does <e> <s> as i understand it we are simply concerned here with what purposes should permit an employee to demand paid time off from his employer <e> <s> as i understand it there is nothing to prevent an employee performing the interesting training or other functions to which the noble baroness referred in his own time <e> <s> all that is at issue here is whether his employer should be bound to pay him for that <e>", "<cs> if the activities appear likely to lead to an employers benefit the latter might well be prepared to pay for the time off voluntarily <e> <s> but is an employer to investigate in advance whether the studies are likely to be to his benefit <e> <s> has the noble baroness also considered that if time off is to be taken for union purposes that have nothing to do with an employer it is the union which should pay <e> <s> unions have their own funds and if a man is to stop work in order to carry out work which the union wishes him to do on ordinary principles i should have thought it was for the union to pay the man <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness oversimplifies this issue by simply suggesting that redundancy payments should be available to anyone under the age of provided they are discharged in the ordinary way <e> <s> there are quite a number of occupations which have an earlier age of retirement <e> <s> i shall refer to one obvious example which i am sure the committee will be aware of <e> <s> in our foreign service retirement in my view most misguidedly is insisted upon at the age of by the foreign office <e> <s> if someone is retained beyond the age of as occasionally happens in the case of ambassadors of considerable quality and then he is dismissed it would be rather odd that he should then receive a redundancy payment having already passed the age at which he might be expected to be retired <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> does that not mean that if someone whose total income is below the level of tax liability as determined by parliament invests his <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that whatever the deficiencies of past ministers who should have known better the fact remains that tax is being extorted from people whose incomes are at a level at which it is generally understood that tax is not payable <e> <s> is that not only wrong in principle but also a considerable deterrent to saving <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the contribution to national defence that this company makes in his previous incarnation my noble friend must have closely followed it quite apart from the monopolies and mergers commission are not the government concerned that this company should continue in operation in order to help sustain our defence effort <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with an extremely narrow amendment to a clause whose heading refers to accounting practices <e> <s> all that this provision permits the secretary of state to do is to lay down the accounting practices to be followed <e> <s> i can imagine few subjects more unsuitable to the affirmative resolution procedure which this amendment seeks to impose <e> <s> it would be largely a technical question as to what was the correct and proper accounting practice <e> <s> it will be right for the secretaries of state to lay that down in order to secure among other things a universal practice throughout the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on the amendment has taken two separate and distinct forms <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has raised the point about the inconvenience of the introduction of a major amendment at this stage <e> <s> there has been a general discussion of the merits or demerits of the community charge <e> <s> indeed the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal in a sense although perhaps she did not realise it was justifying the governments action in putting such an amendment into the bill <e> <s> if she will allow me to say so she made a number of very practical and helpful suggestions in respect of the community charge and its administration to which i hope my noble friend and his department will pay attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for bringing up again an argument which i used at an earlier stage <e> <s> as always he recalled my words with punctilious accuracy <e> <s> however i do not think the position is quite so simple as he suggests <e> <s> there is no dispute that there should be a right to be employed again if one has worked prior to pregnancy for a certain period <e> <s> it is simply a question of specifying the period <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness reminded noble lords there is a difference between this amendment and the one which your lordships discussed in committee namely the provision in subsection which the noble baroness herself quite plainly does not like very much and which gives to the secretary of state the power to exempt certain occupations <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this amendment puzzling <e> <s> the noble lord did not explain i imagine because it cannot be explained how anyone could have feelings of conscience against working underground <e> <s> people may well not want to work underground and may be frightened of doing so <e> <s> as the noble lord said the conditions may not be appropriate for women to work underground <e> <s> however perhaps he could explain certainly to myself and perhaps to other noble lords how any human being could have feelings of conscience against working underground <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is no difference between the two why has the noble lord put both in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very well intentioned amendment but i think the noble baroness lady seear perhaps subconsciously or unconsciously indicated some of the difficulties behind it <e> <s> she said for example that many employers would be unwilling to allow a young worker time off in order to undertake a training course <e> <s> i think that she put it a little too generally but no doubt there are some <e> <s> if that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that the noble baroness would allow me to finish my sentence <e> <s> i shall give way in a moment and give her a full opportunity to explain her position <e> <s> if that is so she would discourage employers from taking on young people who wish to undertake a training course <e> <s> now i shall give way to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness does not appear to see that in saying that she is giving away a great deal of her case for the amendment <e> <s> what she has said amounts to this if an employer is unwilling to provide paid leave every week for training he will not take on or having taken on will dispense with the services of young people who want that extra paid day off for training <e> <s> the effect of her amendment may be the exact opposite of what the noble baroness intends <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i said exactly the opposite <e> <s> i said that the employer would not take them on <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment raises a serious and important issue and merits a little discussion by noble lords <e> <s> there is no doubt that the changes effected by the bill that affect young people will raise a number of practical problems for the young people concerned their employers and the public <e> <s> there is some attraction for me in the idea of a code of practice to cover this area of activity <e> <s> where i part from the movers of the amendment is on the suggestion that the health and safety commission should issue the code of practice <e> <s> as i believe the noble lord lord rochester has indicated i should have thought that a code of practice would be better if produced by the government <e> <s> the government are responsible for the very considerable changes that we are effecting most of which unlike noble lords opposite i welcome <e> <s> however the government are responsible for creating a situation which it is difficult to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to speculate what would be the effect of this amendment if it were to be carried into law <e> <s> once <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend is right in what he says <e> <s> her majestys government offers employment to young men to join the diplomatic service with the condition that the employee will be forced to retire at the age of <e> <s> the government cannot slide out of the situation quite as easily as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he recall that the post office prefaced its introduction of higher charges a few weeks ago with an indication that one of the purposes of those higher charges was to enable sunday collections to be started on a large scale <e> <s> if as my noble friend suggests it applies those collections only in a few places ought it not to reconsider those increased charges <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain how it is that if the unions are not co-operating the post office nonetheless proposes to introduce sunday collections in i think the minister said five areas <e> <s> can he also tell your lordships which are those five areas <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say when the decision will be announced as to whether those relics of the economics of the s and s are to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon at times was seeking to go back on the decision of the house taken at earlier stages that in deference to the sikhs religion they should be exempted from the obligation to wear helmets in circumstances in which all other workers were bound to wear them <e> <s> we had a considerable discussion at earlier stages on that point <e> <s> i do not propose to weary your lordships by going over it again <e> <s> the net result is the bill as it stands <e> <s> at least it has the merits of being clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has it all wrong <e> <s> the fact that for whatever reason the building trade employers organisation which incidentally does not always represent the trade wishes to put itself in a position of difficulty is no reason why your lordships should agree to this <e> <s> in fact we ought to save them from themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i respectfully differ from the noble baroness in what she has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that on the contrary this bill helps to clear the way not least by the removal of outdated restrictions for a new era in which we all hope and believe that there will be a very high level of employment <e> <s> therefore it is especially important that there should not be outdated restrictions on the work that people may do or on the way in which they may do it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend in fact regard it as an improvement when he has to say that per cent <e> <s> of the escalators on the london underground are out of service <e> <s> is he aware of the hardship that that causes particularly to the disabled the elderly and people with luggage <e> <s> in the circumstances does he agree that it is a pity that his noble friend lord brabazon of tara rejected the suggestion made earlier in this house that someone should be appointed to london underground who understands how these things work <e>", "<cs> my lords does that answer mean that a man who is doing his job suffers deduction of tax from his pay but that if he goes on strike he obtains tax-free emoluments <e> <s> how long can he go on doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords when your lordships house i think with a sigh discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e> <s> in the technical and commercial sense it is not a special resolution but it is a separate resolution and as the noble lord knows that is the point <e> <s> it is separate from the whole general motion that the report and accounts be adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal in this amendment is quite distinct and different from the state of the law as regards political contributions to trade unions <e> <s> it does not propose the same arrangements as parliament has laid down for trade unions <e> <s> i do not wish to weary the house with my next point because i spent a little time on it during the course of my speech <e> <s> a union has to have a ballot if it is to have a political fund <e> <s> but having succeeded in a ballot to establish such a fund for years afterwards political contributions can be and are made and can be and are made on a much larger scale in proportion than political contributions are made by companies <e> <s> therefore there is no comparison <e> <s> these are totally different situations <e> <s> there is also the point i repeat it if the noble lord did not take it on board that whereas in many cases a member of a trade union cannot without sacrificing his job leave a union of whose policy in this respect he disapproves shareholders can <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene at this point <e> <s> i said absolutely nothing of the sort suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> i rather resent his trying to attribute such a foolish remark to me <e> <s> i ask him to refer to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take up any more of the time of the house but the noble lord persists in misrepresenting me <e> <s> i said nothing about contracting out <e> <s> i said that whereas a shareholder could sell his shares and get out in many cases a trade unionist could not leave the union however much he disapproved of what it was doing because that might endanger his job <e> <s> has the noble lord got the point now <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us heard the first part of his answer with great pleasure because we feel that during the past session the broadcasting authorities behaved most properly and did a great deal to build up the public estimation of themselves and of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not difficult to reconcile what my noble friend has very properly said about gratitude with discrimination against the older widow <e> <s> is it not the fact that if anything the older widows needs are greater than those of the younger ones <e> <s> does my noble friend appreciate that <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend comes to that meeting will he bear in mind the good point made by the noble lord lord tordoff namely that if there are four days the subjects can be divided far more logically and clearly than if they are compressed into three days <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first join in thanking the paymaster general for his admirable repetition of the statement <e> <s> i also thank him for his vigorous defence of last seasons tax cuts <e> <s> it is the habitual illusion of left-wing economists and politicians that high levels of taxation help the working of the economy <e> <s> my noble friend and the former chancellor are both to be congratulated on their firm rebuttal of such nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there has been plenty of time for this legislation to be thought through in as much as to my knowledge it was first considered in <e>", "<cs> my lords many noble lords will echo the concluding words of the noble lord lord hankey who if he will allow me to say so seemed to speak a great deal of good sense on a number of problems <e> <s> but we shall be called upon tonight to decide on two amendments that in the name of the noble lord lord williams and that in the name of the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> i should therefore like to comment a little on both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that point in due course <e> <s> otherwise i shall only detain your lordships unnecessarily long by breaking the flow of my argument <e> <s> the fact remains that the great majority of people in this country enjoy a higher standard of life than they have ever enjoyed <e> <s> curiously enough some of our problems for example the problems of traffic congestion are a reflection of this <e> <s> the problems of traffic congestion are simply a reflection of the fact that enormous numbers of people who never dreamt of owning a car even years ago now own one <e> <s> there are indeed few families who do not have a car or a share in one <e> <s> one sees it too in the enormous increase in holidays in the mediterranean the fact that people of quite moderate standing in life and in their jobs have holidays now at marbella or at places in the sunshine of the mediterranean <e> <s> there has been an enormous increase in the standard of life <e> <s> that has not been achieved by accident <e> <s> it did not grow in the years before this government came in <e> <s> surely it must be accepted that that is a considerable achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the discussion that we had in your lordships house on this point <e> <s> i am happy to comment on it <e> <s> we were told by the minister concerned i have no reason to doubt his accuracy that the amount provided was calculated to be sufficient and as i understand it there was no suggestion that if that assumption proved to be wrong there would not be an improvement <e> <s> nor is there the slightest evidence let me say to the noble lord that any of those who are sleeping rough or otherwise not availing themselves of social security are doing so because the money had run out under that fund <e> <s> there is not a scrap of evidence for that <e>", "<cs> my lords in his interesting argument has not the noble lord omitted the fact that between and there was no perceptible increase in the standard of living indeed there was a measure of deterioration <e>", "<cs> my lords if the employer simply accepts liability for the charge himself instead of reimbursing the employee or tenant will the situation be the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that carefully drafted reply <e> <s> how does my noble friend justify if he does justify it the substantial discrimination overall between the treatment of the pre and post war widows <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that he has not attempted to answer the basic question as to the justification for discriminating between pre and post pensions simply on the basis of the date of war widowhood <e> <s> does he recognise that until he does so he will leave many people on all sides of this house and outside deeply depressed at the insensitivity of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my admiration for my noble friends robust defence of the indefensible but will he tell your lordships whether those in the government who take these decisions fully understand that opinion in both houses of parliament appears to be overwhelmingly in favour of making that concession <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be better for all concerned including the government if they were to yield gracefully and quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend and the government bear in mind the sordid but practical fact that cathedrals

arrival uninvited of these large numbers of people <e> <s> the great majority of them are not in any sense refugees they are simply illegal immigrants <e>", "<cs> my lords is the remarkable improvement on the past form of the passport office which that answer indicates due to the very considerable pressure which many of us know the noble earl himself exerted upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords

parliamentary salary and allowances added to their ministerial salary which produces a not unreasonable figure <e> <s> however in your lordships house these junior ministers have no parliamentary salary with which to augment their ministerial salary which looks a little bare <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have lords in waiting particularly in mind as they are specifically provided for here <e> <s> to be frank i had more the parliamentary under-secretaries in mind <e> <s> however what i have to say obviously has its applicability to lords in waiting <e> <s> i prefer to refer to the category of junior ministers as embracing ministers of state parliamentary secretaries and lords in waiting in fact the whole of the ministerial team below the cabinet level <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend finally sits down does he appreciate that the argument that he has just used concerning the higher payment to the scottish law officers that unlike their english counterparts they do not receive a parliamentary salary undermines his whole argument in respect of other ministers who are not given the same treatment <e> <s> if that is right for law officers and it is a fact that lawyers are sometimes quite good at looking after themselves why is it not right for all the other ministers in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that not unhelpful answer <e> <s> have he and his right honourable friend considered the representations made by the mail users association rather nicely headed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a falling off in the number of letters delivered the next day <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of a debate which has not been without some elements of bitterness it was agreeable to hear the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale speak as he did <e> <s> i find myself in full agreement with a great deal of what he said <e> <s> i was also in agreement with the reasonable tone in which he put forward his arguments <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of pleasure my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is simply making an assumption <e> <s> there is nothing whatsoever in the bill to compel the solicitor advocate to have another solicitor sitting with him <e> <s> my noble friend says that he always does but we are talking about a situation which has not yet arisen the right of audience in the higher courts <e> <s> because you want to prove that it will be more expensive it is nonsense to assume that that will happen <e> <s> there is not a scrap of evidence in support of it and the bill does not so provide <e> <s> as i have said to my noble friend if he is right it will come out in the wash <e> <s> if it turns out to be more expensive the ordinary client will adopt the cheaper alternative <e> <s> there is therefore no need for my noble friend or any other noble lord to worry about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the turn of this side i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that generally in this country public opinion will be in sympathy with our american friends for the situation in which they were placed <e> <s> it will have full confidence that they acted sensibly to deal with an all but impossible situation <e> <s> is he also aware of the fact that in similar situations world peace will be preserved only if major powers such as the united states are prepared to take upon themselves the risks and dangers inherent in the action which most of us fully applaud <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a custom <e>", "<cs> my lords it has never existed and the noble lord knows that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that unhappiness about the scheme is not confined to the other side of the house <e> <s> is he also aware that on the best possible outcome it must be many years before any saving to public funds results from it <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be wise to use the christmas recess to give further thought to it <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply is he and are the government satisfied that lrt is in a position to enforce the admirable intention which he attributed to it <e> <s> in particular is he aware that some of us can give specific examples in my own case of pm on th december at westminster underground station when there was no member of staff either in sight or within call <e>", "<cs> it was impressive as it always is to listen to the noble and learned lord lord ackner there is no doubt at all that he has a very serious point in respect of the under-provision at present for the county courts to which it is a major purpose of this bill to transfer a great deal of business <e> <s> therefore i believe that the committee will start out with great sympathy with his objective <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i used the word quite deliberately in the light of what he said in his speech <e> <s> perhaps before making any further comment he will read his speech in <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not feel disposed to disregard the highly authoritative advice that we have been given by the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls and the noble and learned lord lord roskill <e> <s> there is no question that consideration of a serious social problem motivates those who support the amendment <e> <s> however with great respect the amendment goes the wrong way about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting answer <e> <s> can he say whether her majestys government regard with equanimity the possession of a substantial navy by the soviet union which obviously has very little need for protection of sea communications or whether they hope to see there too some activity by way of disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend remain firm in a view which he expressed a moment ago that regulation of air fares is not government policy and that they should be deregulated and set by the airlines in accordance with their commercial judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of inflation is my noble friend aware that the million saved by london underground is rather less than would be expected <e> <s> is he also aware that many regular users of the underground would have preferred london underground to have concentrated its energies on securing the mechanical efficiency of the trains and proper working of the escalators instead of installing that expensive machinery which it is perfectly possible to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noted the attempt by the european parliament to intervene in this matter <e> <s> will she indicate that a firm positive and definite reply will be sent to it <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will not favourably consider this <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for the gracious way he responded to my remarks <e> <s> he has with his usual skill deliberately avoided the point <e> <s> the point is that if any body other than a professional association or a trade union in good heart supports such pathetic cases to which he referred it would still be at risk as regards costs <e> <s> he proposes a very special immunity <e> <s> frankly given the relationship between the trade union movement and the labour party one fully understands why <e>", "<cs> my lords minutes <e>", "<cs> i find myself in almost complete agreement with the noble lord lord mishcon a situation almost as embarrassing for him as it is for me <e> <s> i listened to what he said with such agreement that mercifully i can keep my own observations extremely brief <e>", "<cs> i would not have intervened on the amendment had not my noble and learned friend lord hailsham who is obviously enjoying himself a great deal seen fit to misquote what i said on the preceding amendment <e> <s> i did not say and if he consults <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those interesting figures <e> <s> is he aware that under legislation for which i was responsible about years ago the tate gallery has full authority to lend pictures to bodies in official and public buildings <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be better that more pictures should be on display in such buildings where some people can see them rather than to have them stored where nobody can <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that however frequently the pictures are rotated it still means that are at any one time not visible except under the special arrangements to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> will he encourage the directors of the tate gallery to be a little quicker and a little more willing in the lending of pictures to official buildings where there is of course no question of the expense that is involved in respect of provincial galleries <e>", "<cs> despite that speech nowadays i disagree reluctantly with my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> that was less so as he may recall in the old days on the south-eastern circuit when sometimes i had the privilege of appearing against him and once or twice was successful <e>", "<cs> that was a very characteristic observation my noble and learned friend never remembers his defeats <e> <s> this is a case in point <e> <s> however i do differ from him <e> <s> if i may say so i very much prefer the very helpful attitude adopted by the noble lord lord alexander of weedon who seemed to me to approach this matter in a balanced and helpful way <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not exciting the noble and learned lord to do so again <e> <s> i was about to refer to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale when he intervened <e> <s> he undoubtedly said it seemed to me very dogmatically that the change that will be introduced by the bill would not be economical but more expensive <e> <s> i was about to deal precisely with that issue <e> <s> however the point that i was making before he leapt up to intervene was that he did not seem to be particularly concerned with the cost to the public <e> <s> i am glad to say that by this bill the government are so concerned <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton speaks from a sedentary position <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is right why does he think that anyone would employ a solicitor <e> <s> that is the fallacy of his argument <e> <s> if one leaves it to members of the public to decide whom they employ as this bill does they will undoubtedly in general employ the most economical <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend is right then he has absolutely nothing to fear <e> <s> but if he is wrong he may well have certain apprehensions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will consider whether some of these areas could do a great deal to help themselves by making their regions more attractive to prospective employers <e> <s> further does he recall how dundee lost the ford factory together with jobs solely because of obstruction by the transport and general workers union <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the government will recall that twice in the lifetime of many of us the failure of successive governments to provide adequately for national defence brought us to the verge of defeat and involved us in long and terrible wars <e> <s> will the government always keep that recollection firmly in mind and not be led astray by the noble lord lord mayhew <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can he confirm that the government in general and the department of transport in particular are fully aware of the urgency of the situation in the light of the growth in air traffic and the risk of losing air traffic and airline services to airports such as charles de gaulle or schiphol where there is adequate accommodation and likely to be so for some years <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend add to the economic information which he has given and received by bearing in mind that if we make heathrow and gatwick too expensive a great deal of traffic will go not to our regional airports but to european ones which are more economical <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble and learned friend will not accept this amendment <e> <s> it seems to be quite wrong in principle that when a minister of the crown seeks to make regulations he should require the consent of somebody else <e> <s> it puts him in the obvious difficulty that if consent is withheld he cannot make the regulations which he feels he ought to make and which he may very properly be being pressed in either house of parliament to make <e> <s> therefore to place a veto on the lord chancellors regulation-making power in this way even in favour of a deeply respected figure like the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice is quite wrong in principle <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble and learned friend will allow me to intervene <e> <s> if he is good enough to make a personal onslaught on me for being authoritarian perhaps i may suggest that he is being authoritarian in as much as he is seeking to put part of a regulation-making power into the hands of a very distinguished judicial figure who is not responsible to parliament <e> <s> if anything is authoritarianism cutting out parliament in that way is precisely that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a great many people who are deeply disturbed by the incidence of crime in this country and most ordinary people are very worried about it will welcome the statement and the white paper as indicating a determination by the government to come to grips at least with some of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that one of the difficulties of clamping is that when a car that is obstructing traffic is clamped that ensures that it will continue to obstruct the traffic for a considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i express the view of all your lordships when i convey my congratulations to the noble earl lord de la warr on a really very remarkable and highly impressive maiden speech <e> <s> the noble earl comes from a family which has some centuries of highly honourable public service behind it <e> <s> he is clearly in a position to contribute to your lordships debates up-to-date knowledge of the workings of our financial system and to address most interesting and stimulating arguments arising out of that knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord says that because i was about to add that experience has shown that a mixed economy is a mixed-up economy <e> <s> that is exactly what happens because it is the areas of state control and government-controlled industry and all the rest of it which inhibit the working of the free market side of the economy and lessen its effectiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it was as a result of my alleged persuasiveness or whether perhaps as a result of the merits of the matter but the noble lord will recall that the price commission approved the set-up at that time in the cement industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the factors that produce the shortage of cheap land to which my noble friend refers the very restrictive attitude of quite a number of local authority planning committees <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the proposed legislation will deal with a trouble which arises today <e> <s> i am referring to the fact that just when the highway has been restored another worthy organisation comes along and digs it up again <e> <s> in view of the fact that my noble friend says that the matter is being considered does he agree that it was being considered in government to my personal knowledge in <e> <s> is it not now time that something was actually done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is not part of the problem as my noble friend has just said that whereas ministry of defence police can be and often are armed in general private employees are not permitted to be armed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the importance of knowledge of economics among the largest number of people so that they are able to make a proper assessment of the policies of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would draw attention as he did not in his admirably succinct opening to what seems to be a very useful alteration of the rule in respect of giving way during a speech <e> <s> several noble lords have been concerned that with the growth in time-limited debates sometimes involving speeches limited to a very short duration indeed the more popular the subject the shorter the duration of the speech the speaker in question is put in a very difficult position as to whether to give way <e> <s> if he does not give way he is thought to be not acting in accordance with the spirit of the house if he gives way in the course of a four or five-minute speech he wrecks the speech <e> <s> it is extremely useful that the select committee has firmly laid down that during a time-limited debate a person speaking can refuse to give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will pay great attention to the remarks made by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> it is plain to the naked eye that the lighting is not as good as it was <e> <s> moreover i have received several complaints from people who watch the broadcasts of our proceedings who say that we are at any rate marginally less visible than we were <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will take up the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the reference to lunatic policies by the noble lord lord mayhew and he speaks on that subject with authority can the minister confirm that the government will continue to bear in mind that twice in the lifetime of many of us we went into wars from which we suffered and which we very nearly lost largely because in time of peace we had failed to provide for adequate national defence <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the major features of the taylor report to remind clubs of their duty to take care of the people whom they attract to their grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment deals with an important matter but it raises two separate or it seems to me separable issues <e> <s> the first issue is the present state and condition of much of our legal system and particularly the state of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of that review will my noble friend take into account he will be aware of this fact if he looks at his diary that in the six weeks from th april to th may of this year there are three bank holidays that is one a fortnight <e> <s> however during the following seven months until christmas there is only one bank holiday <e> <s> from the point of view of the public and of employees and employers is that not a nonsensical distribution <e> <s> is it not time that the governments prolonged consideration of this matter reached a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the mere cases outstanding to which he referred amount to a considerable infliction of hardship on people who have already suffered a great deal of hardship <e> <s> is he aware that the criminal injuries compensation board has now replaced the passport office as the most incompetent idle and irritating organ of government <e>", "<cs> my lords has the governments hope for an improvement in the service rendered by the london underground yet shown any signs of realisation <e> <s> how many escalators are still out of service and how many breakdowns of rolling stock and hold-ups resulting from them have occurred in the last few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to take up the time of the house in discussing the motion of the noble earl lord russell partly because it is no more than a gesture which can have no practical effect on the passage of the bill and partly because if the criticism in the motion of the drafting of the bill is just and there is a perfectly good argument for saying that then the time to say that there is insufficient information before your lordships for proper consideration of the bill is not now but on third reading when there has been full opportunity for ministers and the rest of your lordships to express their views <e> <s> moreover if we spend time on this motion it amounts to a distraction from what is infinitely more important that is the bill itself and what it seeks to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that somewhat miscellaneous reply <e> <s> will he tell the house when it is anticipated that that service will cover the whole country <e>", "<cs> take the hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not easily shocked <e> <s> i have been too long in public life for that to happen easily <e> <s> however i must confess that i had a feeling of strong surprise when i saw the amendment of my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson on the marshalled list <e> <s> i believe that the case for the amendment has been most effectively demolished by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> therefore i only wish to add a few words to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope not on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been apparent for some sittings of the house that the noble and learned lord lord ackner is able to restrain his enthusiasm for the bill within the limits of decorum <e> <s> i am not sure that he succeeded to my mind he did not succeed at all in establishing that because of that it was necessary to introduce this drastic change in the system of appointing the judiciary <e> <s> moreover the noble and learned lord did not touch on what seems to be essential in the present system and which would be largely destroyed if the proposals of the amendment were accepted <e> <s> i refer to the accountability to the public and to parliament of those who advise the sovereign on the appointment of the higher judiciary the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in respect of some appontments and my right honourable friend the prime minister in respect of others <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is always anxious to jump up behind <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble and learned friend looks at subsection to which he has invited your lordships attention he will see that if someone is appointed who has not been recommended by the commission that information has to be published <e> <s> does he really think that anyone would accept high judicial office on the basis that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is particular reason for celebrating commonwealth day because of the <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord graham of edmonton i welcome the bill as part of the steady progress which the government have achieved over the years in moving activities from the public to the private sector <e> <s> we now have great experience of the practical results of that movement <e> <s> there is no doubt on the evidence that that move has been greatly to the public benefit <e> <s> i shall quote only i could quote many examples by way of example the extraordinary change in cable and wireless whose profit earning has multiplied by five since it moved from the public to the private sector although it is excelled in that respect by the national freight corporation whose profit earning has multiplied six times during that process <e> <s> therefore it is not enough for the noble lord lord graham to say that a proposal for a further step in that direction can be dismissed as doctrinaire <e> <s> of course what he means by doctrinaire is a policy with which he happens to disagree <e> <s> as a good and loyal member of the labour party he believes in public ownership <e> <s> that is an exercise of faith which one cannot but admire <e> <s> noble lords will know that faith has been defined as believing in what you know is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has misled himself but he must not mislead the house <e> <s> as i understand it those reports related only to crown suppliers and not to the major activity of the psa <e> <s> therefore it is quite wrong to say as he has been saying to the house that the psa was given such a clean bill of health as he ventured to suggest <e> <s> that is really not the case <e> <s> that relates simply to the crown suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to enter into debate with the noble lord on the gas and electricity bills among other things i should detain your lordships until a rather late hour this evening <e> <s> in point of fact if he looks at those bills and reads the speeches made about them the noble lord will see that very considerable efforts have been made in respect of both those activities to introduce elements of competition <e> <s> he will find that the government share his concern to see an element of competition there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad that the noble lord keeps re-promoting me to minister <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not from him that is intended as a compliment but it is a little distracting <e> <s> of course his question is utterly irrelevant <e> <s> no one is proposing to have mini-psas in every department <e> <s> each department will have its own section which goes out to contract <e> <s> there will be one section in each department and not sections <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now putting forward a totally different point <e> <s> it is very difficult to pin him down because his mental and physical agility are such that when he has made a thoroughly bad point he leaps away in order to make another from a different angle <e> <s> he in fact said that each department would have mini-psas <e> <s> now that i have drawn his attention to that blatant error he tries to ride off in some other direction <e>", "<cs> my lords that has nothing whatever to do with the bill <e> <s> the bill has nothing to do with the operation of the private sector except in the building and construction area of the psa <e> <s> that is what we are concerned with here <e> <s> that is the only matter on which noble lords will be deciding <e> <s> to speak of other issues with which one could deal if time permitted is to distract the house from the main point <e> <s> the noble lord has now admitted that in the context of the psas work and the putting out of that work to contract the events at deal are wholly irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that far from there being mirth on this side of the house there was considerable resentment at the implication made out of order by the noble lord opposite that a previous reply was untruthful <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that notwithstanding the criticism made by the noble lord lord donoughue a number of well-run local authorities have managed to put forward a community charge that is below the target proposed by the government <e> <s> i refer notably to westminster and wandsworth <e> <s> is not that good example one to be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill goes to the select committee there are two points that i wish briefly to raise <e> <s> first i hope that it will look at the title which describes itself as the london underground safety measures bill <e> <s> given past experience that is a reassuring title <e> <s> however inspection of the bill indicates that it contains a good deal of material and its connection with safety seems to be somewhat remote <e> <s> i hope that before the bill returns to your lordships consideration may be given to giving it a title which is more appropriate to its content <e>", "<cs> i suppose i should begin by declaring an interest as i was as many noble lords will know the first chairman of the caa when it was set up in <e> <s> therefore i approach the matter in a somewhat different way from my noble friend lord kinnoull <e> <s> there seems to be implicit and indeed in his speech perhaps explicit criticism of the authority <e> <s> i hope that whatever else my noble friend the minister does he will make quite clear what i believe to be the fact namely that the authority has done and is doing an extremely good job in what is an extremely difficult and responsible area <e>", "<cs> i have one specific point which i should be grateful if the noble earl on the front bench would deal with when he comes to reply <e> <s> it is my understanding of the scheme that it is proposed to withdraw the social security benefits to which students are at present entitled unemployment income support and housing benefit <e> <s> that was clearly stated both by my noble friend on second reading and in paragraph of the leaflet which he was good enough to circulate <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend the paymaster general knows i am able to keep my enthusiasm for the bill within the limits of proper decorum <e> <s> i have listened closely to this debate which seems to have been concerned not so much with the main merits or otherwise of the bill as with the quite difficult question of timing <e> <s> i say with respect that i do not agree with my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls that were the committee to adopt the amendment that would negate that was his word the decision taken at second reading <e> <s> the amendment itself provides that the bill shall come into effect on st september <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite wrong <e> <s> at second reading we did not vote on when the scheme should start <e> <s> we voted to give the bill a second reading <e> <s> my noble friend is misleading <e>", "<cs> the minister is not <e>", "<cs> there seems to me to be something in favour of this amendment in respect of current students <e> <s> students who have embarked upon their courses at universities or other institutions of higher education started on a certain basis no doubt believing rightly or wrongly that that basis would continue during the normal term of their studies <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend completes his argument will he consider the point that i ventured to put forward that if as he suggests the changeover is to the advantage of current students they should be given the option of whether to go on to it or to remain on their present basis <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend answer my question <e> <s> if the changeover in respect of a current student is to his advantage that should be apparent to him <e> <s> why should he not be given the option either to continue on the basis on which he became a student or to accept the as my noble friend argues more agreeable alternative <e> <s> what is the objection to giving him the option and therefore not appearing to be going back on the basis on which he became a student <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that sensible reply <e> <s> have the spanish government been good enough to offer any explanation of this action <e> <s> it is damaging to the tourist trade and involves territory belonging to a fellow member of the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the conference will result in a reduction of the major source of pollution of the north sea which is the output of the rhine <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reference in the question to the protection of the residents of the city of westminster is my noble friend aware that those of us who live in adjoining boroughs are plain jealous of them since the city of westminster has managed to fix the community charge at a reasonable level <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the established convention that in the county courts solicitors clerks and others are entitled to be heard it seems to me that a possible construction of the bill as it stands may be that this procedure is being brought to an end <e> <s> the bill after all firmly states <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i think it would be helpful to many noble lords if he could indicate how far it is intended to proceed tonight <e> <s> this is a very important and as your lordships know not uncontroversial bill <e> <s> there is a good deal to be said for at any rate the motion that the bill do now pass being discussed at a civilised daylight hour <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be to the advantage of the government if what i regard as the very powerful case for the bill were deployed at an hour when many noble lords could be here and also when its chances of being adequately reported were greater <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he referred to finishing the third reading tonight <e> <s> that indeed was my suggestion <e> <s> he has not dealt with the point as to what should be arranged for the motion that the bill do now pass which as he knows is the normal final stage in which perhaps almost ceremonial speeches are made <e>", "<cs> my lords has there been an increase in the costs and expenditure of london underground to put against the increase in revenue of which my noble friend informed the house <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend studies this matter as he has been good enough to say that he will in the light of the anxieties expressed from all quarters of the committee will he particularly direct his mind to the following situation <e> <s> when a student has taken his degree he starts applying for jobs <e> <s> knowing as a future employer will that this legislation if it passes is in force the prospective employer may be anxious as to whether he is taking on a man subject to a substantial debt liability <e> <s> there are a number of jobs where an employer is rightly anxious and he will not employ someone who is in debt and subject to all the obvious pressures and difficulties which being in debt may produce <e>", "<cs> with respect my noble friend has the point wrong <e> <s> a prospective employer does not know whether a student today has or has not borrowed any money commercially from a bank but he will have a very good idea once the bill is law that the former student whom he is about to employ has a debt <e> <s> that is the great difference <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i agree very much with my noble friend lord peyton about forcing a division on the previous amendment regardless of the very full assurances which my noble friend on the front bench had given <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell is right in saying that technically in this chamber one is free to force a division whenever it is thought right and sensible <e> <s> i hope that he will consider whether it is sensible <e> <s> we are at committee stage and at the close of the debate the minister concerned promised further consideration of the points raised <e> <s> in those circumstances one is at least doing something contrary to the spirit of that approach if a vote is then insisted on and the committee rejects the amendment <e> <s> that may well condition my noble friend the minister to be less agreeable to the propositions that were put than he otherwise would be <e>", "<cs> it is clear from the debate that the problem to which noble lords on all sides of the committee have referred has been created by the decision to withdraw housing benefit from students <e> <s> frankly i do not share the view of one of my noble friends who said that it was wrong for social security measures to be as he put it mixed up with education <e> <s> we are dealing with people on the whole over the age of who for all purposes in law are citizens voters and the rest <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why an unsuperable barrier should be erected between being a student and drawing either this or other social security benefits if on the merits of the case the facts warrant it <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend aware that those figures are not comparable because the social security benefits go only to a limited number of students whereas the figures that he has quoted generally go very wide <e> <s> it is obvious that there is great disquiet in the committee particularly on the student housing point <e>", "<cs> in the light of that answer surely it is sensible to write the balance into the bill <e> <s> that does not commit a future government in whichever government that may be to maintain that if they are prepared to legislate <e> <s> however when you are discussing a provision which on my noble friends own view is to last years there does not seem to be any objection to writing that

expressed from both sides of the chamber to the effect that appointments should be made on merit and irrespective of the political alignment of the people appointed <e> <s> but the terms of the

financial interests <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us have been shocked and horrified by the action of certain sections of the teachers <e> <s> it has damaged the

of the noble lord the leader of the opposition they show that professional devotion to the care of children which they certainly used to show <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that

according to my recollection began in december <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will have a further look at the matter <e> <s> i have been listening to the debate with some care <e> <s> i was a little surprised to find that the possible exclusion of audit commission surveillance from this large area of public expenditure seems to be contemplated <e> <s> can my noble friend say before he goes on to reconsider the matter whether as the bill now stands the audit commission will still have its normal function which as he rightly said a moment or two ago relates to efficiency <e> <s> if as the bill now stands there is a doubt about that it surely seems sensible to put in something along the lines of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware how much his tribute to british air traffic controllers will be appreciated by all those who have worked with them <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies to that question does he recall that the debate on the social security bill was extremely interesting and valuable <e> <s> is he aware that many of us thought it was a great advantage that unlike much other legislation the second reading took place in daylight

united kingdom income tax or any income tax <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down in view of his reference to the possibility of a conflict with another place has he thought about a major source of conflict which will arise if these amendments are carried and inserted into this bill in the light of the amendment inserted into the social security bill in another place on th march <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is absolutely right in saying that we can amend and that another place can amend <e> <s> however i ask him to consider whether that makes good sense <e> <s> we are trying to help a very unfortunate section of our population <e> <s> with the full approval of another place there is a provision which will go a great way towards achieving that <e> <s> because some of us may prefer in certain detail our own ideas it surely does not make good sense and certainly does not make good social sense to involve ourselves in a long and complicated conflict with another place which will delay the remedial measures that we all wish to see <e> <s> if the noble lord really wishes these people to be helped quickly he will withdraw his amendments <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow

what it does it remains premature to adopt a partially conflicting amendment <e> <s> as always i am deeply indebted to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i specifically limited that observation to inspectorates and organisations in the social security area <e> <s> as regards the tax inspectorate i can only say <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i understood that the noble baroness was referring to tax inspectors and one always has great admiration for them or at least it is expedient to say so <e> <s> the factory inspectorate is a different area <e> <s> the point i made is that i am afraid that in the social service sphere that danger is real <e> <s> i believe that from her own experience the noble baroness will realise that <e>", "<cs> as i understand it those matters would be taken into account when the revenue support grant for the local authority concerned is under consideration <e> <s> as i understand the amendments they simply pick out those two specific items and seek to treat them separately in respect either of rural areas or of inner cities <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear from my noble friend what the effects of doing that will be <e> <s> it is certainly my understanding that questions such as the degree of extra costs in particular areas must be taken into account when the general revenue support grant is under assessment and that there would not necessarly be any case for simply picking out those two matters and dealing with them differently from every other issue that arises in that respect <e>", "<cs> i take up one matter raised by the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i do not believe that he meant it seriously when he suggested that because of the greater efficiency which would follow from the adoption of these proposals there would

concerned with some immediate expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the labour partys record on nationalisation is it not very reassuring to find noble lords on the opposition front bench now anxious that concerns should make a profit <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend take note of the success of lee kuan yew in singapore in dealing with drug trafficking by making it a capital offence and enforcing sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made a splendidly emotional speech in the true tradition of the labour party and one cannot let it pass without comment <e> <s> we know that the noble lord hates anything being privatised and is a sincere exponent of what he believes to be the merits of public enterprise <e> <s> but that view is not shared by many noble lords <e> <s> in particular it is not shared by those of us who from time to time have had dealings with the property services agency <e> <s> the presence of the noble lord on the woolsack prevents me from referring to episodes somewhat nearer home <e> <s> however anyone who has had dealings with the psa will know that compared with similar organisations in private enterprise it was slow and costly <e>

can he tell us whether any of our european colleagues reproduce that provision in our law under which it is lawful to sell a pornographic magazine on a sunday but a criminal offence to sell a bible <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the fact that a law riddled with anomalies absurdities and contradictions does nothing whatever to reinforce or support the christian idea of sunday but merely reflects the bad system that we operate and which your lordships house unlike another place was prepared to alter a short time ago <e>", "<cs> nobody disputes that child benefit has been a useful part of our social security system <e> <s> the question that this amendment poses is whether priority be given to increasing it in line with inflation over the many other directions in which that money could usefully be spent <e>", "<cs> that does not apply at all <e> <s> on the one hand the noble lord is talking of a tax <e> <s> we are here speaking of a payment from the exchequer to the

leaving it to them to decide whether chivalry demands that the noble baroness should speak first <e>", "<cs> i cannot carry a list of interventions in my mind <e> <s> i hope i shall be allowed to reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> there is all the difference in the world between reducing the burden of taxation and making a grant <e> <s> i do not want to weary the committee by widening the debate but the levels of taxation imposed particularly the higher levels have a considerable impact on the growth of the economy the development of productivity and the stimulus to effort <e> <s> with great respect to the noble baroness therefore it is utterly irrelevant to compare making a social security payment to the better off with any reduction which can be made in lowering the level of taxation <e> <s> experience over the past few years has shown that that has greatly mitigated the working of our economy <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to contradict the noble baroness and i am sure that it is hopeless to do so but there is all the difference in the world between making social security payments to people from public funds and deciding to take less from their earnings by way of taxation <e> <s> if the noble baroness cannot see that i can only comment that she obviously fails to understand the effect of taxation particularly of high taxation on diminishing the growth of the economy the incentive to work to undertake enterprise and to take risks <e> <s> if that is so we must agree profoundly to differ <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to say that if that is the view of the liberal party it is no doubt one of the explanations for its state today <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not recognise that there is obviously some force in what he said <e> <s> one has a much better incentive by reducing the tax that the person concerned pays <e>", "<cs> this seems a sensible proposal <e> <s> unless the form is such that the provision can be made without amendment to the bill i hope that my noble friend will consider the matter <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what action to take on this amendment perhaps my noble friend can say something further on the position of those who have been overseas in the service of the crown whether in the armed forces or in the foreign service <e>", "<cs> we are told that the amendment derives from the european social charter <e> <s> however that does nothing to increase my enthusiasm for that somewhat controversial document <e> <s> on the other hand if we were to put what is proposed into our law it would be a marvellous benefit to the legal pr of essions <e> <s> i say that because if it were put into law it would give rise to an enormous possibility of litigation on the largest possible scale <e> <s> i am sure that it would be of the greatest benefit to the legal professions though perhaps not to anyone else <e>", "<cs> even if the noble baroness is right that is no argument for extending benefits to the legal profession although of course i know that its members would be happy to have them <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> surely there is all the difference in the world between the secretary of state having to satisfy himself that certain provisions are adequate he is answerable to parliament for the decision he makes on that and laying down in a statute that something shall be adequate <e> <s> that is a matter which could only be interpreted by the courts which will be in a hopeless position to do so <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble baroness lady turner said <e> <s> i was responsible for the administration of the industrial injuries scheme for a period of six and a half years and therefore have some knowledge of

being asked to approve a proposal for which there is obviously a certain amount to be said but equally obviously would involve quite substantial national expenditure <e> <s> it is significant and there are perhaps grounds for complaint that neither the noble earl who moved the amendment nor any of the three noble lords who supported it have given the faintest indication of what the cost of implementing it would be <e> <s> i appreciate that they do not have the means that the minister has for giving an accurate assessment on such a matter <e> <s> on the other hand it is hardly fair to ask the committee to approve a proposal with no indication whatsoever of the cost <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down will she deal with this point <e> <s> i accept thoroughly what she said in her last few sentences <e> <s> surely we should know the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend make it quite clear that the government will not be diverted from their anti-inflation policy for the sort of considerations that have been suggested by among others the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that few of us would

<e> <s> he was quite plainly not available for any other employment <e> <s> although i have a great deal of sympathy as the noble baroness knows with the general objection to the withdrawal of social security benefits from students i wonder whether the amendment goes too far <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord russell relieved my mind when he explained that this particular amendment derived from the social charter <e> <s> that explains its woolliness <e> <s> indeed i have often thought of the social charter as i think of this amendment in terms of the well-known advertisement from the clothing industry that there is no substitute for wool <e> <s> i do not believe that if the amendment were included in the bill it would make the slightest practical difference because it is so

of care <e> <s> to put that into statute would be very unusual and it would certainly present the courts if the action of a local authority were challenged with a most remarkable task of interpreting whether the authoritys philosophy of care would be outraged by doing this or that and indeed what that philosophy of care was <e> <s> it is a nice rhetorical expression but it would be a serious error to seek to put it into statute <e> <s> i can hardly believe that it is meant seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this was a most excellent speech setting out the position of this country with great clarity and that i for one was very glad to read it <e>", "<cs> my lords when the history of this government comes to be written one of the features which will stand out most prominently is the change that they have been able as a result of a series of measures to introduce into our industrial scene <e> <s> your lordships will recall not many years ago the domination of our economy and of a great deal of our life by the trade unions the major strikes and all the hustle and flurry of midnight meetings at downing street followed by a settlement which very often was expensive and very often was not accepted the whole confusion caused by the excesses and misuse of trade union power <e> <s> that was the picture let us remember it not many years ago <e> <s> the government by a series of measures as my noble friend lord strathclyde said moving step by step have changed the situation largely though not wholly by changing the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> one becomes confused by those agreeable scottish cities <e> <s> the dundee case is of great importance not merely because of the immediate loss of an enterprise which would have employed to begin with and in due course people <e> <s> it involved big investment in this company <e> <s> it involved the giving of employment in an area where it was greatly needed <e> <s> what happened must have had a discouraging effect on ford and perhaps other companies which were contemplating investment in this country <e> <s> the noble lord cannot merely brush that case aside and say that it is so unimportant that it does not need dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to interrupt the noble baroness immediately but i believe that she is subject to a misunderstanding <e> <s> the closed shop as she calls it in the legal profession is not based upon membership of an organisation <e> <s> it is based upon people having obtained certain qualifications which is a totally different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope first that my noble friend will carry out the suggestion made by my noble friend <e> <s> if he plans to reject the amendment which i hope he will not on the grounds of cost he should state fully what the cost will be <e> <s> secondly perhaps he will offer some answer to the rather difficult question of why four years after parliament enacted the measure it has still not been put into force <e> <s> if it was right four years ago after all it was carried by the same government can he explain why it is not right now <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he tell the house when the consultations which are not yet completed actually began <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not grossly unfair to pick out one engagement in respect of one minister in complete ignorance of all the other items of business which the heavy load carried by ministers today involves <e> <s> will my noble friend make clear that his right honourable friend has been carrying a considerable burden and should be free to choose which engagement it is most urgent for him to fulfil <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh does not appear to realise that there is a basic contradiction between the terms of his <e>", "<cs> that was a rather non-vintage reply if i may say so <e> <s> the noble lord seems to be in a state of some confusion in respect of the analogies that he referred to <e> <s> i speak with due diffidence and timidity on the subject of the national rivers authority as a consequence of the noble lord sitting behind me <e> <s> the national rivers authority has specific serious and important responsibilities <e> <s> however those responsibilities cover a specific area <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble lord does not see the point that there is an enormous difference between looking at a body such as the national rivers authority and deciding that in those circumstances power should be delegated to that distinguished body and dealing with a bill which goes right across the field of pollution <e> <s> i do not accept that in the case of a bill which covers every aspect of pollution it should be contemplated that power should be given to the minister to delegate all the functions of the bill outside parliamentary control <e> <s> if the noble lord cannot see the difference between those two cases i cannot help him further <e>", "<cs> the civil aviation authority was given considerable powers but as the noble lord will recall from the days of his very helpful co-operation which i am pleased to thank him for now after many years when he was the minister concerned there was still a residue of authority left in the department of trade and a certain number of questions could be asked <e> <s> if i may add one pendant to that i was told that i as chairman and a member of the house could attend your lordships house when those questions were asked <e> <s> i was not allowed to intervene but said the civil servants facial expression is not excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that whether or not a white paper is necessary public opinion in this country will

nuclear conventional and chemical warfare equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl will recall we have discussed the matter in this house on several occasions and there has been no general consensus of view <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said this amendment raises big issues <e> <s> she told your lordships about the consideration that had been given over a good many years to the possibility of equalising our state pensions or rather national insurance pensions <e> <s> however she understated the length of time that that proposal has been under consideration <e> <s> i can tell the house that when i was the minister of pensions and national insurance in the late s we gave serious consideration to the issue <e> <s> if the departments archives have not been scattered or damaged my noble friend will no doubt be able to turn up that evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously misled the noble baroness <e> <s> the high costs would arise in connection with men rather than women because men would be receiving the full retirement pension at or the compromise age of <e> <s> that would involve very large numbers <e> <s> that would involve the cost of paying the pension and also the loss of a good deal of work because it would encourage earlier retirement <e> <s> the men would cost the money not the women <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will be able to answer the point that has been made by the noble baroness <e> <s> on the face of it to change the law retrospectively and deprive individuals of benefit on which they have won a legal decision seems a somewhat oppressive action <e> <s> it may well be that the noble baroness has misunderstood the position and that my noble friend will be able to explain it <e> <s> if he cannot do so then i feel that the government might be subject to some criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> are the government aware that the law on sunday trading is now in a state of hopeless confusion which is unfair both to individual retailers and to the local authorities which have responsibility for enforcing it <e> <s> are the government unless they obtain some formula for agreement content to leave the law like that <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend regard it as proper for a responsible government to accept that the present state of the law is confused unenforceable and unfair to all concerned and yet say that they propose to do nothing about it <e>", "<cs> my lords to his enormous regret my noble friend lord whitelaw who is chairman of the carlton club is unable to be present <e> <s> he has asked me as his predecessor to say a few words on behalf of the club <e> <s> i too thank my noble friend for repeating the statement <e> <s> to members of the carlton club it is important and in its wider implications it is probably a statement of considerable national importance <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friend and the members of the club i too express gratitude to the police and the fire service who responded with great speed and their habitual courage in order to rescue injured people and to do what they could to rectify the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the social charter is a singularly well-designed instrument for increasing both unemployment and inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those listening to these questions are shacked and horrified at the attempt by certain noble lords opposite who happen to disagree with the transaction to make wild charges of corruption for which they have not a scintilla of evidence <e> <s> it is utterly contrary to the principles and practice of this house to make them <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend proceeds will she indicate to your lordships where an accurate and proper copy of these regulations is to be found <e> <s> the copy i have which i obtained this morning is full of amendments of every kind corrections simply inked in like a schoolboys notebook <e> <s> coupled with that are several pages of typed riders <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend lady blatch will take this matter seriously <e> <s> we are being asked to legislate <e> <s> when one is asked to legislate one is asked to approve of some document be it a bill or a regulation in the clear form in which it is to pass into the law of the land <e> <s> can my noble friend really say that this dirty bit of paper with inked-in corrections deletions and amendments all over it and with two typed-in so-called riders is the form in which your lordships house should be asked to approve legislation <e> <s> if a minister cannot provide us with a proper copy of a proper document would it not be the responsible line to defer discussion until a proper copy is available as i am sure it will be in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i collected it this morning from the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness replies to that i must ask her again why if there is a correct and tidy copy available apparently one was made available to the noble baroness lady young it has not been made available not only to noble lords on the opposition front bench but also to other noble lords who are interested in this matter <e> <s> in a sense the fact that a proper copy exists but is not available makes the position worse <e> <s> the noble baroness should think further before asking your lordships house to consider an important matter in such a handicapped way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady blatch appears to have been taken by surprise <e> <s> however as the government chief whip was in the chamber a moment ago i think it only fair to say that earlier this afternoon i warned him about this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is helpful as ever <e> <s> however he does not appear to appreciate as he would if he were to look at the document that although it may be alleged to be accurate it is extremely difficult to understand or to follow <e> <s> it is difficult to be sure what each inked-in amendment means and what it relates to <e> <s> the noble earl must appreciate that it is difficult to debate an important order without a properly completed document for us to consider <e> <s> if copies are available within the department there is a great deal to be said for sending for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he recall that as recently as last week i was told that the total subsidy given to the tobacco industry in europe was over million a year in value <e> <s> is he aware that many taxpayers in this country much resent their money being used to subsidise an industry which can do so much harm to health and life all the more so because the exports are now being beamed very much to the third world <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that there is not only an economic but also a very strong moral question here on which a great many people feel very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords no in total <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend clear up the total expenditure figure <e> <s> if he looks at the reply that he made a fortnight ago he will find that the figure of million was our contribution out of a total from the community of million <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that that is a massive subsidy which is being given to this industry <e> <s> is he aware that the argument that the area concerned can only grow tobacco could be the same argument used by colombia to justify growing cocaine <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not difficult to justify giving aid to the soviet union while that country continues to maintain its present high level of defence expenditure which takes a substantial proportion of its national product <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a rather unusual amendment both in form and in substance <e> <s> it takes the unusual form of using a provision in a statute to amend regulations <e> <s> that is obviously an inconvenient procedure particularly for those who will have to administer its provisions in as much as there will be no indication in the regulations as at present printed that the statute has amended them <e> <s> nor is there anything in the statute to indicate the exact terms of the regulations which it amends <e> <s> therefore it is an inconvenient practice but no doubt a permissible one <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a few words because i have not yet taken part in the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson appeared to put forward a reasonable case but surely there is a good alternative procedure <e> <s> if noble lords desire to alter the provisions of a regulation they can table a motion in the ordinary way requesting the government to amend the regulation <e> <s> if noble lords can persuade the house to carry that motion most governments will be inclined to respond <e> <s> if governments do not respond they will get themselves into considerable difficulties and trouble <e> <s> surely that is the practical way of proceeding <e> <s> however the course proposed in this and a previous amendment whereby one has a statute in the list of statutes appearing to amend a regulation in the book of regulations will cause unnecessary confusion <e> <s> there appears to be a simple way round the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords he did not <e> <s> he got it wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords all social security bills are important because they matter a great deal to certain sections of the community which are in one way or another in need or in difficulty <e> <s> they are equally important because our whole social security system requires constant supervision by the minister constant review by parliament and changes to be made to deal with different situations for example the emergence of different needs changes in the economy and changes in the national way of life <e> <s> therefore this is a very important bill <e> <s> i hope that the fact that your lordships have taken a good deal of time to deal with it and rightly so in my view will not deter the government from introducing future legislation as it appears necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that that suggestion would go down well with the noble baroness <e> <s> however having said that this is a good appointment <e> <s> it is an excellent idea because there are many cases in which the social security system causes difficulty to individuals <e> <s> it is most useful to have someone to whom individuals can go and ask for support in solving their problems <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the factors that has helped to generate inflation the excessive wage demands which the government have had to deal with <e> <s> will my noble friend confirm that her majestys government intend to be resolute in resisting those <e>", "<cs> my lords might the suggestion in the question have certain implications in respect of national sovereignty <e> <s> is that not therefore a further reason for the caution which my noble and learned friend has indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be wiser to defer debating this subject until next tuesday when it will arise in clause of the employment bill which incidentally the noble baroness is seeking to strike out <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment particularly the concluding words <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley seemed to have little enthusiasm for them <e> <s> they seem to suggest that only nonentities should be appointed to the commission <e> <s> it is quite obvious that we want a balance of political social and other opinions among those appointed to this extremely important body <e> <s> the amendment seems to rule out any individual whose appointment would give undue prominence to any political party or opinion <e>", "<cs> go on <e>", "<cs> this is a very one-sided amendment <e> <s> it proposes to impose on the commission a duty to <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness will look at her own amendment <e> <s> it proposes to impose a statutory duty on the commission to seek to reach an agreement <e> <s> it imposes no comparable duty on the unions to seek to reach agreement <e> <s> therefore it is one sided <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that that does not answer the question as to whether or not the government were consulted <e> <s> it also does not answer the question as to the view of the government on an increase in prices which many of us believe is likely to produce a substantial inflationary effect <e>", "<cs> my lords in connection with my noble friends answer to my earlier supplementary question in respect of sunday collections in the area where i live is he aware that last saturday i visited my local post-box and saw plainly on it a notice stating that the next collection would be on monday <e> <s> how does he reconcile that with his answer <e>", "<cs> this is an extraordinary amendment as was pointed out by my noble friend <e> <s> even more extraordinary is the argument to which the committee has just had the privilege of listening <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that in the interests of fairness <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mccarthy does not accept the governments proposals in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as my noble friend lord strathclyde very generously made clear they spring from a line taken by the opposition in another place on which the government have shown their flexibility of mind by accepting <e> <s> that seems to me to have produced a fair and satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> i take exactly the contrary view to that expressed by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> this is a very important clause it is probably the most important clause in the bill <e> <s> it marks the end as i believe the noble lord lord mccarthy hinted of a long process in dealing with what i have always regarded as the outrage of the closed shop <e> <s> it is the end of the pre-entry closed shop <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord though i always find his agreement a matter of personal embarrassment <e> <s> the point i was making was that if he is right i do not seek to judge between him and the government why is he so worked up about it <e> <s> if it is on the decline if it is dying why is he so indignant <e> <s> why does he regard it as such an outrage <e> <s> why does he table an amendment to strike the clause out of the bill <e> <s> if he is right i am sure he takes the line that he is right his argument is weaker than ever <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> the reason why the noble lords views are taken as official is because he puts the case for the labour party so much better than the front bench does <e>", "<cs> i was a little intrigued to hear the noble lord on the front bench opposite so noticeably hankering after <e> <s> that is a good example of the backward-looking attitude which now appears to dominate the labour party <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can appreciate that a measure may be perfectly appropriate at its time but that does not mean that for the rest of eternity one has to accept it <e> <s> i rather hope that the noble lord believes in progress <e>", "<cs> i wonder in what circumstances it would not be reasonably practicable for members of a trade union who are employed to be included in a ballot <e> <s> if they are available to be called out on strike it seems that it should be possible to include them in the ballot <e> <s> i am a little puzzled when the noble lord says that there may be some persons whom one can call out on strike but who cannot be included in the ballot <e> <s> can the noble lord explain that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not explained the circumstances in which it cannot be reasonably practicable to include these persons in the ballot <e> <s> if they can be called out on strike they can surely be included in the ballot <e> <s> is not this provision possibly opening quite a gap in the law <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also put in a bid for a copy of the report <e> <s> in view of the great and long-term importance of the decisions in this matter will your lordships house be given the opportunity to debate the matter before the government come to a final decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is aware that many people both in your lordships house and outside wish to congratulate the prime minister on her great success at this conference in achieving a decision to reduce the degree of protectionism in world trade particularly agriculture <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that it is helpful to cite examples of particular aspects of the law in other countries <e> <s> they are part of systems which in many other respects differ from ours <e> <s> they may have merits <e> <s> they may be particularly applicable to the circumstances ruling in those countries <e> <s> but they have no direct relevance to what we should do in this country <e>", "<cs> i should like to finish my sentence <e> <s> i have a respect which i hope the noble lord shares for english grammar <e> <s> i see no reason why the <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord has it almost entirely the wrong way round <e> <s> in the first place if you exercise the right to strike you break your contract with your employer <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to say that if it is in the course of an industrial dispute it does not matter <e>", "<cs> i can give one very obvious example <e> <s> if you exercise your legal rights to introduce a civil action you incur an enormous penalty by way of costs <e> <s> the noble lord knows that perfectly well <e> <s> he must face the fact that responsible serious-minded people in serious matters such as striking have to count the cost of what they are doing when deciding whether it is worth while to do it <e>", "<cs> if being a good european means doing what other european countries do however silly we may regard it i admit that i am not a good european <e> <s> on the contrary i hope that the example of our efficient system of operation will cause our friends in europe to imitate us rather than expecting us to imitate them <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to open up that subject i am prepared to speak for three-quarters of an hour on the marvellous economic performance of this country during the past eight to years <e> <s> however i shall say only the words which i am <e>", "<cs> let us hope not <e>", "<cs> what the noble baroness says is the opposite of what has happened <e> <s> the numbers of unemployed have fallen and so have the number of strikes <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness knows perfectly well that in the past year or two the exact opposite has occurred <e> <s> the numbers of unemployed have reduced and so have the number of strikes <e> <s> the noble baroness cannot get away from that <e>", "<cs> one always listens to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway with great respect because he has great knowledge of the subject and his views are generally acceptable to the committee <e> <s> however he is omitting consideration of what seems to me to be a practical difficulty of the amendment <e> <s> unofficial action is taking place <e> <s> it is proposed to put on the employer the duty to warn each individual taking part in that action before he can be dismissed <e> <s> if there is unofficial action of that type the men may not be there <e> <s> one of the obvious examples of unofficial action is when people do not come in to work <e> <s> they may be at home out or watching a football match <e> <s> to put upon the employer the obligation to give a specific and definite warning to each individual before he takes such action is putting on him an excessive burden <e>", "<cs> that is another matter <e>", "<cs> this is a very interesting discussion but can my noble friend tell me whether incidents in which this matter has arisen have occurred or are they purely theoretical <e>", "<cs> this is a very odd amendment <e> <s> we have moved from questions of safety at work for which many of us have great sympathy for those concerned to using industrial action as a means of enforcing other pieces of legislation against an employer <e> <s> that cannot be right <e> <s> if an employer is guilty of a breach of the race relations act for example the proper course is not to take industrial action against him but to report the matter to the prosecuting authorities <e> <s> the same is true of a breach of the sex discrimination act or the equal pay act <e> <s> it is not a question of enabling employees to try to enforce the law by the use of industrial action <e> <s> that would be a wholly improper use of such action <e> <s> as this amendment would apparently legalise that provision i very much hope that we shall not spend very much time on it and that we shall reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the comments which

interesting and encouraging figures <e> <s> is he aware that they constitute a vivid illustration of the change for the better in the economic and social structure of our society which has taken effect during the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the ineffective if vigorous attempt of the noble lord lord bruce of donington to rubbish the extremely encouraging answer given by the minister significant as to the hostility of the labour party to the ever-increasing number of private shareholdings <e> <s> will the minister ensure that the public become fully aware of this <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that anyone of a cynical disposition might be somewhat amused to hear the noble lord lord ennals waxing with such apparent indignation against the partial deferment of proposals of which when they were before this house he was such a bitter critic <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has helped me because he has now admitted that he was extremely critical on those three headings which he has just enunciated <e> <s> despite those criticisms which he has just confirmed on at least three grounds he now seeks to make a degree of party capital out of the partial deferment of some of them <e> <s> any of us who had the misfortune to listen to the noble lords intervention a few moments ago will realise that that is a perfectly fair comment on his observations

towards the applicant that these cases should be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that it seems to some of us who have been concerned in war pensions administration that it is contrary to the whole spirit of that system to rely on the highly technical question of which form of cancer has arisen <e> <s> is it really sufficiently certain that while radiation can produce some forms of cancer it cannot in any circumstances produce other forms <e> <s> is that really being maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords my first and most agreeable duty is to express your lordships admiration

house is thinking about we are being asked to legislate in a way which would cover a substantially higher figure <e> <s> indeed in moving the amendment some time ago the noble lord lord bonham-carter said that it would give a small degree of flexibility <e> <s> again it would do a great deal more than that <e> <s> if it were to give a small degree of flexibility only there would obviously be much stronger argument for it but it does not <e> <s> it would provide complete freedom to the secretary of state at a future date to fix whatever figure he liked provided he could get the approval of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite true but it does not enable the noble lord to escape from the fact that he said it would give a small degree of flexibility <e> <s> does he attempt to justify that <e> <s> of course he does not <e> <s> he is well aware that that is the point i was making <e> <s> therefore it is a highly damaging amendment to the whole concept of the bill

phrased and largely irrelevant rhetoric <e> <s> i should like to bring noble lords back to clause which seems to me to be necessary in order to make quite sure that trade unions carry responsibility

subject especially in view of past history <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that the late winston churchill once observed that the peace of europe had been preserved for many years by the balance of terror <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady turner of camden was quite right when she said that this bill was a further example of the governments step-by-step approach in dealing with trade union law <e> <s> where i differ from her and where the facts of the situation differ very dramatically from her view is the effect that we have seen over the past decade of a series of measures <e> <s> the noble baroness and your lordships will recall that or years ago there was an enormous series of industrial disputes with all the drama of midnight meetings at no <e> <s> downing street with people summoned at the last moment in the hope of averting damaging strikes <e> <s> much damage was done to our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the labour partys record on inflation when in government is it not reassuring to find the noble lord lord bruce now appearing to be against it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the house as a whole is grateful to him for making the statement on this important matter and for making it if he will allow me to say so with such force and clarity <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that many people outside and i believe inside your lordships house approve of the per cent <e> <s> margin involved in that decision <e> <s> although several of the major countries in europe have a lower margin per cent <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that it seems prudent at any rate at this stage to give us this degree of flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords it is noticeable that the only speeches in support of the amendment have been made by the noble lords whose names are on it <e> <s> all other noble lords who have spoken have been extremely critical of it following what seemed to me the most effective demolition of the amendment by my noble friend lord whitelaw <e> <s> i see that my noble friend lord stockton has listened attentively to the debate <e> <s> i hope that he will feel that the sensible action now is to withdraw an amendment which quite obviously lacks support <e> <s> from the point of view of many of us it seems to be wholly wrongly conceived <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can she say whether free movement of british agricultural produce into france now exists <e> <s> if it does not exist will she suggest to the energetic mr delors who is always reminding us of the duties of members of the ec that he might pay some attention to the obligations of his own country in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend make clear whether the british agricultural export trade to france is now back to normal <e> <s> i do not believe that she did so in her original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate my noble friend on his admirable maiden performance at the dispatch box will he say whether under the present situation wages councils <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by my noble friend lord stockton proposes a new head of public expenditure <e> <s> i believe that your lordships will feel that for that reason it requires very careful examination <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware when dealing with a proposal for public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords these are important matters to the people concerned <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness lady birk is right to raise those issues and to ask my noble friend to clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i have no sympathy at all for the noble viscount lord tonypandy <e> <s> can he tell your lordships what is the cost to public funds of the mass of conflicting legal decisions taken in our courts as a result of the present confusion of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that whereas the community charge is carefully calculated to enable people to vote or not to vote regarding expenditure which they will have to meet the same is not true of the unified business rate which falls very heavily on small businesses especially those in the south of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not claim that the amendment is perfect or that if enacted it will work miracles <e> <s> but i should like at any rate to express appreciation of the care which my noble friend lord ferrers has taken both at this stage and at previous stages to consult opinion on all sides of the house to listen to argument and to adjust the earlier amendment in the light of those comments <e> <s> your <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way as he has been good enough to refer personally to me <e> <s> why he should regard it as an insult to say to people that they prefer to act in one way or another i cannot follow <e> <s> all of us in this house speak sometimes with considerable partiality certainly the noble lord does <e> <s> i was trying to say that if one undermines the legal framework it is no insult to those operating inside it to say that they will act more freely and express more partiality than if they know that legal duties are being properly imposed upon them <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord trying to stir up excitement by saying that i was insulting anybody <e> <s> i am not even insulting him <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what was the reduction in the national debt over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however is it not a fact that if the original order had been drafted as my noble friend now suggests it will be that would have saved between million and million of public expenditure <e> <s> is it not quite clear that the department failed to provide for the case where overspending by local authorities should be counterbalanced by a governmental charge as is now proposed <e> <s> in view of the fact that million to million of public expenditure is of considerable importance will my noble friend take this matter back to the department and ask it to do better <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that what she said was not a mistake was the failure to do what she said will now be done and that that failure has cost the british taxpayer between million and million <e> <s> if that is not a mistake i wonder what my noble friend regards as a mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend most sincerely for discharging the very considerable task of repeating this massive and detailed statement <e> <s> it is one of the most important government statements of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend deal with the point that if the post- widows had a higher pension than the pre- widows a flat percentage increase will give them a bigger increase than the pre- widows and therefore the gap will be widened <e>", "<cs> my lords what justification do the spanish government give for their refusal to allow this service to be reconstituted <e> <s> the service dates back many years <e> <s> is this part of the futile spanish attempt to grab gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however is he not aware that it is a very disappointing answer in as much as the original announcement made at the time of the increase in postal charges indicated that whole areas would have a complete collection <e> <s> does not discriminating in this way mainly against rural areas undermine the whole doctrine which has supported the concept of the post offices monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain why after some months of such discrimination there is still no indication on letter boxes of whether they are subject or not to a sunday collection <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is greatly indebted to the noble lord lord shepherd not just for the extremely interesting and if he will allow me to say so extremely lucid speech explaining some highly complicated matters but for the work which his sub-committee has done on those two important subjects <e> <s> i am glad that your lordships house is now debating the two reports <e> <s> perhaps i may also add how glad i am that i am to be followed by the noble lord lord clinton-davis <e> <s> apart from his experience as a european commissioner he will recall that a number of years ago when i was chairman of the caa he was a minister in the department of trade which for some reason was then the department concerned <e> <s> we had many and from my point of view most helpful dealings at that time for which i have always been grateful to him <e> <s> i shall listen to what he has to say with especial interest for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that contrary to the views expressed by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead many people in this country are profoundly thankful that we have a prime minister who is prepared to stand up firmly and with determination for the preservation of the sovereignty of this country and the rights and powers of parliament <e> <s> is he also aware that for a thousand years control and management of currency has been a mark of sovereignty and that serious people will hesitate a great deal before deciding to surrender that basic right of a sovereign power <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up a point made by the noble lord lord ennals that the proposal of my noble friend lord stanley does not involve taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to both noble lords <e> <s> the proposal of course does involve taxation directed against dog owners <e> <s> the fact that it will be dog owners only who will pay the tax does not prevent it being taxation <e> <s> if the constitutional point has any validity the noble lord is wrong this is a proposal for taxation <e> <s> it is taxation which would fall severely upon certain types of people <e> <s> the old widow who has a dog for company will find herself compelled to pay or whatever it may be per year and will find that a hardship <e> <s> the fact that taxation is discriminatory and causes hardship does not prevent it from being taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend most warmly for repeating this immensely important and to those of us who have not been given copies of it extremely complicated statement <e> <s> the statement began with a reference to the maintenance of the same level of public expenditure as a percentage of national income <e> <s> can he indicate what the percentage figure is of public expenditure as a percentage of national income <e> <s> the government rightly i think regard that as important <e> <s> it would be extremely interesting to have the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for those somewhat disturbing figures is not the inevitable conclusion that this country and its allies should be very cautious indeed about believing that this is an opportune occasion for a peace dividend <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government make it clear to mr gorbachev that his peaceful intentions would carry a great deal of weight if he did not continue to impose on the struggling russian economy that enormous defence expenditure for which no explanation has yet been given <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that most interesting answer <e> <s> is he aware that the information is available to and in the hands of those who look for it <e> <s> it shows that during the period dismissals amounted to nine <e> <s> five cases were withdrawn and cases were adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i am overcome with flattery by his answer and the suggestion that i have more influence over those in another place than her majestys government <e> <s> however agreeable i may find that proposition it is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that whatever the cost to public funds of the initial action the improvement in service rendered by the ports will more than compensate for it <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has had the privilege and pleasure on and off during the past years of listening to the noble baroness lady castle of blackburn perhaps i may say what a personal pleasure it was for me to have the opportunity of hearing her again this afternoon <e> <s> i hope she will allow me to say that that pleasure was accentuated by the fact that far from having lost any of her previous vigour she seems stronger and more determined than ever <e> <s> as such she gave great pleasure to all her admirers among whom i venture to number myself <e> <s> i am sure that she will be a very great asset to your lordships house and i hope she will speak frequently on issues though i somehow doubt whether i shall always find myself in the completest agreement with her <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is trying to attribute blame he will recall that the government of the late lord attlee to which i referred succeeded a coalition government in which lord attlee was deputy prime minister <e> <s> i forget whether the noble lord lord jay was a member of that government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course pedantically right they succeeded a caretaker government which lasted for about four weeks <e> <s> however that is utterly irrelevant to the argument and no one knows that better than the noble lord <e> <s> the succession as regards the management of economic policy fell to the coalition government and the noble lord will well recall that in they left behind them a mess <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord should equate himself with me but i refer to the gap in his distinguished mentality <e> <s> probably he does not have to use the underground but the expression mind the gap is only too familiar to those of us who do <e> <s> there is a gap in the noble lords reasoning <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord callaghan will withdraw the charge that he made against me of having been a member of mr heaths government <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for the compliment to the late conservative administration which is unusual from him does he not realise that the long continued development under this government is a complement and continuation of that <e> <s> there is no conflict between the two ideas <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether anything is being done to improve the condition of london underground and to reduce the enormous number of breakdowns both of vehicles and the signalling system which almost every day causes hardship to the travelling public <e> <s> can the minister say whether anything can be done if necessary by making fresh appointments to get london underground on the move <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a good bill to do two good things <e> <s> first it is to help to bring forward a programme of toll roads and secondly to regulate those who dig up existing roads for no doubt worthy and responsible purposes <e> <s> i wish i could say <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the british forces in the gulf are under the command of a singularly able and distinguished officer general de la billire in whom those concerned have the greatest confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that physical access through the tunnel is now possible <e> <s> in view of that is it not a little disturbing that she has said that precautions will be taken when the tunnel is operational <e> <s> will she assure the house that precautions are being taken now <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend clarify one matter <e> <s> in view of the fact that it appears that saddam hussein has removed from kuwait much of that countrys wealth and many of its assets would it be regarded as compliance with the united nations resolution if he simply withdrew but did not restore the stolen property <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow has done a considerable service to the house and to the commonwealth by raising this subject this afternoon <e> <s> this house frequently discusses europe but it is a lamentably long time since it has discussed the commonwealth <e> <s> therefore it is good to make a contribution towards restoring the balance <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord greenhill will not take it amiss when i say that a two-and-a-half-hour debate is a wholly inadequate period for discussing this immensely important and complicated subject <e> <s> i hope that the government whips will decide that before too long we shall have a whole day in which to discuss the commonwealth <e> <s> the subject is so important that it is better to spend a day discussing the affairs of the commonwealth than for example having a blank monday from time to time <e> <s> i hope that the whips office will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend stay whether it is intended to enforce british law in this respect <e> <s> in view of the answer to the first question this afternoon that might be an appropriate response <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend clarify his answer about action taken in cases where the load is excessive <e> <s> he indicated that the driver would be made to unload but if the vehicle is too large and its dimensions are excessive will it be denied entry <e>"]
