["<cs> my lords first of all perhaps i may take the opportunity of thanking the noble baroness lady nicol for her kind words <e> <s> i am also grateful to her for organising an opportunity for me to speak on this occasion in this session <e> <s> if i add the word just that describes the situation in which i find myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i compliment the triumvirate of maiden speakers <e> <s> the noble viscount lord mills was most sensitive in recognising many of the problems that will arise in genetic engineering <e> <s> we all look to the occasion when we shall have unmuzzled the noble lord lord clinton-davis and he will be able to set forth his real feelings on many issues <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mcnair will lead the house with sensitivity through many of the problems which are part of the centre stage picture of pollution and pollution control <e>", "<cs> i support much of what the noble lord lord clinton-davis has said <e> <s> as chairman of the royal commission i am sure that many of his statements are right about the time we spent on that study the intensity of our concern and the importance that the commission placed on the matter <e> <s> i go so far as to say that the success of the application of gmos would depend upon the release committee <e> <s> it is important to give it good recognition <e> <s> in addition i am very much of the opinion that its work should be made public a point to which i am sure we shall return on other amendments as and when they come up and that public access to information is important for success in this area of work <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to the amendment <e> <s> i speak with some considerable concern <e> <s> the royal commission spent a great deal of time discussing with a great many people their concern over this particular aspect <e> <s> i understand that the process of sending such matters to the appropriate committee and seeking its opinion before release could be time-consuming <e> <s> however i do not believe that that need be the case <e> <s> it is perfectly reasonable for the appropriate committee to deal with the matter very expeditiously <e>", "<cs> with reference to the groupings amendment no <e> <s> touches on a different topic altogether <e> <s> therefore i withdraw it from the groupings list <e> <s> i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords who have spoken in favour of the amendment <e> <s> it clearly is a difficult point <e> <s> i am somewhat disappointed that the minister cannot see a way of applying this type of what i believe to be a gentle form of appeals system which would allow people at least to have faith and establish what they believe to be the actuality of the situation <e> <s> however i see on looking at the marshalled list that we are to have yet other cases of appeal systems being brought forward so if i may i should like to contemplate what has been said tonight and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak in favour of the appeal system <e> <s> it was one of the features that we looked at on the royal commission <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord mccoll we had great difficulty in trying to designate who the enforcing authority should be <e> <s> the idea that it might be the release committee appeared attractive but it was recognised that there might be important features other than the purely scientific impact of a particular approach <e> <s> that was why we moved away from that type of solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> i am speaking only on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has been dealt with <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am concerned about this matter but i take it that we are talking here about a different timescale <e> <s> i am consoled by the fact that in the initial stages the register will essentially be an individual register of the people who are carrying out the trial experiments <e> <s> however a time will come that is the success story of genetically modified organisms when there will be general releases of gmos on a commercial scale of the same nature and magnitude as occur at the moment with pesticides <e>"]
