["<cs> my lords i hope that it is not considered indecent of me to make my maiden speech so soon after my introduction but i wish to make a few remarks about clause of this bill <e> <s> may i preface my remarks with a few brief personal words <e> <s> first i wish to thank those noble lords who have spoken already for the kind remarks they have made <e> <s> secondly i should like to say that soon after the new year when my name was mentioned in the honours list i read in <e>", "<cs> my lords my own interest is remote in that when i go to the country i tend to go to the north-west of england where straw is scarcely ever burned <e> <s> i suppose the only nuisance that i have to put up with is the odour which comes from the neighbouring farms which use silage instead of the more pleasant-smelling hay <e> <s> i read very carefully the unstarred question which was asked in november of last year when i was not a member of this house and i have listened to all of this debate except unfortunately most of the opening speech of the noble lord lord alport so there is no need for me to rehearse all the arguments for and against <e> <s> and as a late speaker in the debate i have to make up my mind as has everybody else whether or not the time has now come when the nfu code and the use of local authority by-laws should be replaced by national legislation <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> it is always difficult to decide whether or not education and persuasion and perhaps the use of local powers can do the trick or whether statutory compulsion nationally should be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just answer that question i am very glad indeed to hear that the noble lord lord stanley of alderley is with me on a national scheme <e> <s> the immediate answer is that we should vote on the principle of this bill which may be amended in committee <e> <s> indeed there are a number of details that i should like to see amended <e> <s> not least perhaps the bill may incorporate something like the polluter pays principle as i am on my feet again perhaps i can mention that <e> <s> industry is subjected to the polluter pays principle and i see no reason why agriculture should not also be subjected to that principle <e> <s> it would mean perhaps something like a levy on cereal farmers who may then contribute directly towards the urgent solution of finding alternative uses for straw and stubble so that the bill can effectively come into operation in five years time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may jump to my feet just once again it is the industry as a whole which pays under the polluter pays principle <e>", "<cs> may i say a brief word as my name has been mentioned by the noble lord lord wigoder in connection with some amendments which the alliance are moving in respect of clause concerning parliamentary control <e> <s> i myself agree with the noble and learned lord as i said on second reading and with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich who has just sat down that much though one dislikes the orders in part ii they must be continued for the time being <e> <s> i will only pray in aid the words of lord jellicoe <e>", "<cs> i must confess that those words are very disappointing <e> <s> as far as i can gather the minister is offering no hope of a commission of three parliamentarians who are privy counsellors <e> <s> he is simply saying that he will buff up the quarterly statistics <e> <s> if that is all he is offering it is exceedingly disappointing and i am sure that the noble lords lord fitt and lord wigoder will also find it a disappointing reply <e> <s> i do not think that it meets the case at all <e>", "<cs> i must not prolong this debate any more but i strongly agree with the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i envisage that the report of the three wise parliamentarians who are privy counsellors should be able to say whether or not they recommend that for instance part ii of the act should still be in force after the end of the year in question <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw this amendment but without prejudice to tabling further amendments of the same kind on report if the government have nothing further to offer <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble lord lord wigoder has said <e> <s> as there was an extensive debate on part ii and the exclusion orders i can be more brief than i otherwise would have been <e> <s> i can see that the government might have some objection to the form of amendment proposed by the noble lord lord wigoder in that it would have the effect of quintupling the time available in the house of commons and time is a scarce commodity in another place whereas my rather more modest proposal would have the effect of only doubling the time from minutes or so to minutes or so <e> <s> to that extent i think that my amendment is perhaps more acceptable to the government than lord wigoders amendment but i entirely agree with the general spirit of what the noble lord lord wigoder said <e>", "<cs> my lords while i strongly support everything that is done and ought to be done to stop abuse of the orange badge scheme by persons not entitled to it which tends to bring this admirable scheme into disrepute may i ask this question <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the orange badge scheme represents discrimination in favour of the disabled and that it is as well to record that fact on a day when we are about to debate a bill about discrimination against the disabled <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may follow the noble lord lord renton if only to agree with the first part of what he said as i had the honour to serve under him in the committee on the preparation of legislation where we strongly recommended that definition clauses should come at the outset of bills <e> <s> so to that extent i must congratulate the noble lord lord ennals on what he has done and support the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords fortunately for the house but unfortunately for me i seem to have lost the notes of what i intended to say on the operation of the vaccine damage payments act <e> <s> anyway much of what i would otherwise have said has already been said by those who have spoken before me <e> <s> so i shall be rather more general and less specific in what i say than i would otherwise have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may rise to support what the noble lord lord shackleton has said about these amendments and i should like to welcome the words of the minister when he said i think it was about these amendments and some more amendments to come that he hoped he would be able to be as helpful as it is possible to be <e> <s> i can scarcely recollect more encouraging words than that in advance of the consideration of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that he should have access to any reasonable administrative support would that extend to someone outside the department for instance a counsel learned in the law a senior counsel as i suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords for that very handsome undertaking by the minister which i feel sure is welcomed by all sides of the house the noble and learned lord lord denning the noble lord lord fitt and the noble lord lord mishcon for the opposition have each indicated that it is satisfactory so far as they are concerned and i gather from nods on the liberal benches that it is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for his explanation and i should very much like to consider it <e> <s> my instant reaction is that it is moderately but only moderately satisfactory <e> <s> i wonder whether somehow or other between now and third reading it might be possible for the noble lord to consider whether this paragraph might be more restricted <e> <s> of course i have conceded that it is necessary in respect of clause orders but if it were possible between now and third reading to restrict it to the very few cases where it would be impossible or impracticable to lay a renewal order for the reactivation of a part which had been allowed to lapse it would certainly give me some reassurance <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would be kind enough to give an indication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords though i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord howie of troon i take a different view about the value of the ministers undertakings to which i attach very considerable importance <e> <s> there are three strands <e> <s> there is the undertaking which the noble lord gave in committee <e> <s> there is the undertaking which the noble lord the minister gave on an earlier amendment about the commissioner <e> <s> i think that is by far the most important of all the undertakings as far as i can see that commissioner will be able if he thinks fit in his annual report to say for example that in his opinion after he has carefully examined all the evidence the exclusion orders should lapse <e> <s> parliament will have had the guidance of that commissioners report <e> <s> with great respect lord howie of troon i think this is a considerable undertaking for which we should be extremely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords dare i say a brief word about this amendment to which my name is attached <e> <s> i must congratulate the noble lord lord shackleton for having worried at this like a terrier from second reading to third reading <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords as a cross-bencher who has taken part in the proceedings from second reading until this motion <e> <s> that the bill do now pass may i say that as a supporter of the bill i am also extremely grateful to the noble lord the minister for the concessions he has made in response to arguments advanced in the house <e> <s> in my view the house has rightly concentrated on four areas exclusion orders clause that is information about acts of terrorism the powers of arrest and detention which we worried at right to this very stage today and last but not least parliamentary control <e> <s> i believe that this house has extracted if that is the right word although i think i used another word earlier or the minister has vouchsafed three important undertakings <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will feel himself to be grateful also to those who have not spoken <e>", "<cs> may i appeal to the noble viscount not to press this amendment at this stage <e> <s> it really is to a certain extent connected with the amendment which he has already withdrawn no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> which was not moved <e> <s> if this amendment were pressed to a division we would not unless it was defeated be able to discuss the amendments of the noble lord lord alport and to have the very important discussion which we must have on the model by-laws <e> <s> it would be most inconvenient if that were to happen and i should have thought it was for the convenience of the committee that we should proceed to the amendments of the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> perhaps if the noble viscount wishes to do so he could return to his amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> may i intervene at this stage and if it is convenient to the committee speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that may we not hear the views of the noble lord the minister on the model by-laws <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may move amendment no <e> <s> solely for the purpose of eliciting a reply from the minister about the remarks which have been made regarding model by-laws <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness in the chair i believe that the amendment is in the possession of the committee and it is competent for any noble lord to move the amendment <e> <s> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think that we are speaking to amendment no <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> if i may with the leave of the committee i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby has said <e> <s> i much regret that the original provision has been almost inadvertently deleted from the bill <e> <s> i ventured to agree at an earlier stage of the bill with dr johnson that if a man is under sentence of death it concentrates his mind wonderfully <e> <s> i was glad to see a short time afterwards that much the same sentiment was put into the royal commissions report at page where after the words quoted by the noble lord lord alport not merely was it the royal commissions recommendation that this should take effect in five years time but it was also the recommendation of the countryside commission and the national society for clean air <e> <s> they went on to say this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that non-committal reply <e> <s> i hope he is not put off by the fact that the tories were virtually excluded from office for nearly a hundred years after the glorious revolution <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether he does not agree that the significance of the year is that the modern parliamentary system dates from the glorious revolution whereby the government depend upon a majority in the house of commons for their existence and is this not worthy of celebration <e> <s> further is it not worthy of celebration that we have had peaceful changes in administration for nearly years <e> <s> would it not be particularly suitable to celebrate that fact in what might well be an election year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that it accords with the answer which her noble friend lord glenarthur gave me to a written question that there is no evidence that snuff-taking by inhalation as practised in this country constitutes a health risk <e> <s> if that is so why do not the government actively encourage smokers who cannot kick the habit to change to snuff <e>", "<cs> my lords if this is the attitude of the government of the royal college and that much respected body ash is it not rather a killjoy attitude <e> <s> is it not a case of the best being the enemy of the good <e> <s> furthermore might i ask her if she does not agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the information that a draft code is in hand <e> <s> i have myself the msc report of on the quota scheme <e> <s> would the minister not agree that that report shows conclusively that the statutory quota scheme for the employment of registered disabled people is widely disregarded cannot be enforced and is impossible to be implemented because the number of registered disabled people is less than the per cent <e> <s> quota <e> <s> that being so should not the act of which brought in the quota be repealed and replaced as soon as possible by legislation on the lines recommended by the msc in <e> <s> further if the government do not wish to introduce such legislation themselves will they consider giving drafting assistance and providing parliamentary time next session for a private member to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the question of the noble lord lord somers about private members bills is the minister aware that private members bills often have a very good chance of success if the government are benevolent and provide drafting assistance and parliamentary time <e> <s> is this not a matter of urgency in view of what we have heard about the serious state of unemployment among the disabled <e>", "<cs> as my name is down to this amendment perhaps i may speak before the minister replies <e> <s> i very much wish to support the noble baroness lady seear in what she has said <e> <s> i know the minister has said that the good local authorities are not within light years of rate capping <e> <s> but the trouble is unfortunately that the local authorities which provide adult education are not just those outside light years but those within months of being rate capped <e> <s> unfortunately they are the very ones <e> <s> on that ground alone there is a case for singling out adult education from other areas <e>", "<cs> i do not quite follow the noble lord when he says that if you exempt adult education from rate capping you are telling the local authorities what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has talked about more modest proposals <e> <s> does he agree that the proposal now put forward by the residents of temple sowerby is indeed a modest scheme for a short single carriageway bypass of only just over one mile <e> <s> is that not a very reasonable proposal by comparison with the previous proposal for a bypass in this area and all the other much more extravagant bypasses some of us think rather too extravagant that there have been during the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a contribution from the cross-benches <e> <s> first i wish to congratulate the noble lord lord alport on following someone who he might regard as his master the late lord butler of saffron walden in achieving by these amendments what was the art of the possible in political terms though they do not go as far as the noble baroness lady nicol would like or as far as the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby would like or indeed as far as i would like or even more important perhaps as the royal commission on the environment would like <e> <s> that royal commission recommended that on good general environmental grounds there should be a terminal date of five years for the burning of straw and stubble <e> <s> they applied that principle across the board <e> <s> whoever the polluter may be they believe that a terminal date concentrates the mind and encourages the scientists to effect the cure which would otherwise not be effected unless there was this terminal state <e> <s> however having said that i must of course accept that any legislation is the art of the possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i might at this juncture thank the minister <e> <s> i am satisfied and grateful for what he has said in that respect <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add my voice in support of this group of amendments <e> <s> i should like to echo what was stated by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> while the amendments are related they are not dependent upon each other <e> <s> i should therefore like to concentrate on this single amendment <e> <s> i wish to speak particularly in view of the remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> there must be a little confusion in his mind if i may say so with respect because i do not think that amendment no <e> <s> and the other amendment in the name of the noble baroness <e> <s> lady lane-fox conflict in any way <e> <s> i believe that they are complementary <e> <s> it is not therefore a case of one or the other but perhaps of both <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may follow the noble lord lord ennals if only to say that he has really taken the words out of my mouth <e> <s> i am very glad indeed that the noble lord lord banks withdrew amendment no <e> <s> if only because as drafted it clearly did not command support from all sides of the committee but amendment no <e> <s> is a different matter altogether <e> <s> it seems to me to be the key amendment in this package of related amendments <e> <s> moreover as the noble lord lord ennals said it is an essential and logical complement of the provision in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have some sympathy for the employees of the iran bank in london having myself been required to wear a prescribed form of dress for some years i wonder whether the noble lord lord molloy would declare his support if the servants of parliament resisted the requirements of both the houses that they should wear prescribed forms of dress <e> <s> they include the attendants the doorkeepers black rod the yeoman usher the clerks at the table and indeed the lord chancellor himself as i believe that he would call himself a servant of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say something at this stage <e> <s> i have not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the minister in resisting the amendment <e> <s> there is a touch of frivolity behind the seriousness with which the amendment has been moved <e> <s> i recall that the late lord conesford moved a similar amendment to a bill which was entitled the park lane improvement bill <e> <s> a dual carriageway was made and part of hyde park was taken for the purpose <e> <s> lord conesfords amendment to the short title was to substitute hyde park diminution bill <e> <s> that amendment was resisted on the grounds of frivolity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lady for just one moment <e> <s> it always used to be said of nannies that they referred to miss manners <e> <s> is the noble lady making the speech that i hoped would not be made the governessy and nanny speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lady making the speech that i hoped would not be made <e> <s> that is the nanny speech and the governess speech the one that refers to miss manners <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have only seconds in which to thank all noble lords for having taken part in this debate which has admirably covered the ground <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the question of which i have given the noble lord notice although very recent notice that is how far does he expect the committee to go today <e> <s> i ask this particularly because there are certain people who are especially interested in clause in part ii which deals with the severe disablement allowance <e> <s> it would particularly help the disabled if the noble lord could give some indication as to whether it is to be reached today and if so at what time <e> <s> i know how difficult it is to make these forecasts but i shall be grateful for any help that he can give <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to being disappointed with the ministers answer <e> <s> i do not really believe and i doubt whether the house believes that he really addressed himself to my important point about the local authority budget cycle and the constraints which it imposes upon the parliamentary time table <e> <s> under this procedure i fully recognise that in ordinary circumstances the affirmative resolution procedure for bringing part ii of the bill into operation is quite formidable but in this particular case it suffers from the very grave disadvantage that it is constrained by the local authority budgetary cycle <e> <s> that may mean especially under the provisions of this bill that the affirmative resolutions cannot come before either house of parliament until either just before or immediately after the beginning of the new financial year <e> <s> in those circumstances the affirmative resolution procedure has no value whatsoever <e> <s> if either house chose to vote against it or had any kind of delaying tactic it would be pretty well tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the government and local authority finances would be in a state of chaos <e> <s> it is that which makes me regard this as of special importance in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may speak before the noble lord the minister replies <e> <s> i would not have spoken if my amendments had been successful but i feel compelled to do so as they were not <e> <s> i attempted to have a time limit put on to this part ii for many of the reasons but in addition some others adduced by the noble lords lord sandford and lord northfield <e> <s> i must say that if this general scheme in part ii had been as seemed to have been envisaged at the time of the white paper activated more or less forthwith in the event of the selective scheme not working that would have been in accordance with precedent the sort of thing one would have expected and that one is perhaps used to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a final word about part ii of the bill which has agitated members of both houses of parliament during its passage <e> <s> there were two notable speeches during the second reading debate in the house of commons one by a former prime minister and one by a former secretary of state for the environment mr geoffrey rippon <e> <s> they both expressed extreme unease as to the parliamentary propriety of proceeding by way of part ii for the general scheme <e> <s> that unease has been echoed in this house and re-echoed right to the very last stage and the government have not seen fit to agree to any of the many alternative proposals which have been put forward <e> <s> that is regrettable <e> <s> but i must once again express my gratitude to the noble lord lord bellwin and the secretary of state himself for at least considering carefully all the suggestions which have been put before them <e>", "<cs> my lords so much has already been said that i can be brief <e> <s> i should like particularly to draw attention to the terms of the motion which points to an urgent need for expansion of adult education and vet almost every speech has lamented the decline in adult education due to the squeeze on local authorities and financial constraints imposed by central government <e> <s> so far from getting an expansion it looks as if we are getting a reduction of these essential services at a time when they seem to be more and more necessary <e> <s> there are more people unemployed than ever before <e> <s> there are a higher number of immigrants who need to learn the basic skills of the english language which they have to acquire before they can get a job however intelligent they are <e> <s> this is the kind of help which the adult and continuing education service and only they can provide <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that i think the range diversity and number of amendments put down to clause in themselves show the concern of all the disablement organisations at the new severe disablement allowance <e> <s> this should i think give the government cause for thought <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome this turn of events <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord ennals has proposed and i welcome the minister s response <e> <s> if i may say so i was very impressed by his answer about the careful monitoring and the undertakings about that as well as the flexibility and so on <e>", "<cs> i see the noble baroness nodding that she is in agreement with the proposal that i should withdraw the amendment as indeed i shall <e> <s> in doing so i should like to thank the minister for his helpful reply which has indeed answered some of my questions <e> <s> however any questions which have not been answered can be pursued in the discussions which the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> has proposed and which the minister has accepted <e> <s> with those comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not as well to remember as the noble lord lord molloy has reminded us that there are male as well as female nurses <e> <s> is it not the case that in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be the case that if the noble baroness spoke to amendment no <e> <s> and then withdrew it then it would be possible for the noble lord lord stallard to move amendment no <e> <s> but not otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might briefly support the noble baroness <e> <s> i am very grateful to her for moving this amendment on report <e> <s> as she said i think it is the same as the amendment which i moved in committee which i then moved as a probing amendment <e> <s> in committee i did say that the range diversity and number of amendments put down in clause in themselves showed the concern of all the disablement organisations at the new severe disablement allowance and that this might give the government some cause for thought <e> <s> the range diversity and number of amendments has now been reduced to the three which are on the order paper so we have made some progress in the interval <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said i think that is very largely due to the discussions with the noble lord the minister the noble earl lord caithness and the minister for the disabled which have taken place on the initiative of the noble lord lord ennals and very useful they were too <e> <s> i think there was a useful exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take up a phrase which was used by the noble earl in reply to the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> if i took his words down correctly i think he said that the only possible alternative to having an age limit is not to have an age limit <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that may i suggest that there is an alternative <e> <s> that is to include a provision in clause for the minister by order to vary the age limit in the light of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount the minister for that reply <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the msc on its progress towards completing the draft code in three days time <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the most constructive way forward following the remarks of both noble baronesses be for the government to drop the concept of registration of disabled people in relation to employment <e> <s> is it not the mere fact of registration that makes it so difficult for this legislation to be implemented <e> <s> if the code of practice whether voluntary or mandatory were embodied in legislation would not that be a very satisfactory way of making progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i first congratulate him most warmly on his elevation to the cabinet <e> <s> also if i may i congratulate his noble friend lord young of graffham on his elevation to this house and to the cabinet from the manpower services commission <e> <s> this is a most notable autumn double for the house of lords <e> <s> is the minister aware that presently disabled people and employers i believe at all levels will very much welcome the progress that has been made on the drafting of this code of good practice <e> <s> however would the code not <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the text of this question and i refer to the question itself is it not inappropriate to use the word building in conjunction with the word peace <e> <s> is it not right that one can keep or breach the peace or offer to make peace but can one build it <e>", "<cs> further to what the noble and learned lord has just said in view of the complication of this matter and in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said that he would have brought his alternative clause before the committee but was unable to do so for the reasons which he gave would he not agree that when he brings his new clause forward this clause should be recommitted <e> <s> unless it is recommitted the house will not have the freedom it ordinarily enjoys to discuss it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am right in the impression that the proceedings so far perhaps it is pushing my luck a bit to say so seem to be rather less inflammatory than they were at this time last year <e> <s> we have had a very moderate speech from one farmer the noble lord lord john-mackie and a very full account of the reasons why another farmer the noble earl who has just sat down would not like this bill to have even a second reading <e> <s> they have expressed their views in very reasonable and moderate terms <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have not <e> <s> i have explained that the arts council and the sports council are grant distributing bodies and this is not to be a grant distributing body at all <e> <s> that is a very <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the noble baroness very briefly by saying that i regret that i did not have consultations with that council <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how long i have to wind up but so much has been said that i am sure no one will want to prolong this debate further <e> <s> i must thank most warmly all those who have spoken from every side of the house <e> <s> i would say there was per cent <e> <s> support <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> is perhaps withheld by the noble earl lord longford though when he was pressed by the noble earl lord attlee he appeared to say from a sedentary position that he was really in support after all <e> <s> if that is so i think i can claim per cent <e> <s> support <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of the evening and at this stage in the debate it is very difficult to say anything new <e> <s> but what i can say new in congratulating the noble lord lord blake on introducing this bill today is that this house has not as some people who are ignorant of the house might think a bad record on electoral reform <e> <s> i have found an example exactly years ago of the duke of richmond trying not unsuccessfully to interest this house in proposals and i quote from the record which was then not official <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour and pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord vinson and to congratulate him on a most notable maiden speech <e> <s> he has clearly demonstrated great powers of oratory as well as expertise in the creation of wealth and we all appreciate the expertise as well as the oratory <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is a member of the victorian order i believe that he has been in the services both as a soldier and as a sailor <e> <s> we have heard about his scientific interests <e> <s> we also know that he is closely interested in the fine arts and in the crafts <e> <s> so perhaps i may adapt those great words from hamlet and say that the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed i think they do and many have a quota much in excess of per cent <e> <s> i have no wish whatsoever to criticise industry in many ways but it is statistically impossible because the number of people who are registered as disabled are fewer that per cent <e> <s> of the workforce <e> <s> it is statistically impossible for this act to be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make a few brief comments in support <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for asking this question this evening for many reasons and for one in particular that he and i both suffered the same kind of injury much the same period ago in my case years and i think in his case years and both of us had the same experience of being put into mixed wards where we saw at first hand that long ago speech therapists at work <e> <s> that is something one will never forget because it is a quite distinct and special gift and a training which i have valued from that day to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will agree it is highly desirable as the noble earl has said that the government are moving towards a comprehensive scheme for the disabled but is it not incomprehensible that that should be used as an excuse for the non-indexation of payments for vaccine-damaged children <e> <s> why can there not be a move towards a comprehensive scheme for the disabled and in the interim the indexation of these payments <e> <s> how is one to justify the non-indexation of these payments <e> <s> that was in fact the original question put by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and we have not had an answer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the noble baroness has spoken to these amendments in such a persuasive way and has created such a consensus climate that it will be almost impossible for the minister to resist these amendments on voluntary organisations and other subsequent amendments to clause <e> <s> the absence of the noble lord lord hunt who originated this proposal in committee and the right reverend prelate the bishop of london is sad <e> <s> i should also like to apologise for the absence from these benches of the noble lord lord bancroft who very much wished to be here and to be associated with what the noble baroness lady faithfull has said <e> <s> he has given me a brief note of some of the matters he proposed to raise <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister quite sure that those three district councils would agree among themselves <e> <s> is it not conceivable that one of them might agree with a district of another political persuasion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i revert to merseyside <e> <s> the noble lord has taken this as an example <e> <s> is it not possible and i will say no more than that that the conservative districts and one of the labour districts might combine and it would be that combination <e> <s> you would then have two who would be having a scheme forced on them but they will be two labour districts and not two conservative districts <e> <s> surely that turns his argument on its head does it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to some disappointment because i had hoped that the noble lord would agree to this <e> <s> i think that really he has addressed himself only to the arithmetical side and has added a little political tinge to the arithmetical side in his answer <e> <s> what he has not addressed himself to is my argument as to equity <e> <s> it is merely an equitable application of the two-thirds rule that you should round down instead of round up <e> <s> it is in fact impossible to have two-thirds exactly without a fraction and you cannot have a fraction in a district <e> <s> all that i am asking is that there should he an equitable application of this rule in the metropolitan counties as there is exactly as it so happens in london where the application is out of boroughs <e> <s> that is really not asking for very much <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is not annoying me he is grieving me <e> <s> i think that this is unreasonable <e> <s> i would ask leave to withdraw at this stage because i think there must be ways of putting this matter equitably in the bill if not in these very words then in some other words <e> <s> so with the leave of the house i should like at this stage to withdraw the amendment without prejudice to coming back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the leader of the house what is the question before the house <e> <s> it seems to me that the entire discussion is outside the rules of order of this house because no question has been put <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might have a word immediately after the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter because he has spoken specifically on the procedures of the house <e> <s> for myself i would say that the table must have passed this otherwise it would not be appearing on the marshalled list <e> <s> but let that pass because peers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one other point before the noble lord interjects <e> <s> he quoted the principal reasons for the moving of amendments on third reading <e> <s> i would only say that the word is principal and not only <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether or not that was an interruption of my speech but may i take it as such <e> <s> i think that what it boils down to and of course i shall not bandy words about the use of the word principal in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble baroness lady faithfull and to congratulate the noble baroness lady birk on having put down this amendment at this stage if only because it has elicited that very remarkable speech from the noble baroness lady faithfull a speech which i believe she would have been able to utter if proceedings had been more favourable or more orderly at the previous stage <e> <s> i feel very strongly that our procedures need looking at because the noble baroness lady faithfull had a most unsatisfactory deal at that stage and today she has had the full opportunity to express her view which she has done most eloquently <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether as i have my name down to this amendment i may be allowed to speak at this stage <e> <s> hitherto on this bill i have not spoken partly because more or less everything that could be said has been said but i have silently indicated my opposition by consistently voting for the amendments to improve this bill in committee amendments which alas <e> <s> have been resisted by her majestys government supported i feel rather sheepishly by a trickle of government supporters <e>", "<cs> i merely said that the noble lord was making dissenting noises my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave the house to judge the worth of the noble lords intervention <e> <s> but i find it upsetting that the noble baroness should have to say things like that and that the house should have to listen to such distasteful words thoughts and expressions <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for what he said <e> <s> i think that he was right to speak when he did <e> <s> he shortened the debate as he answered a number of questions which had been posed and some which had not <e> <s> i think that we are greatly in his debt <e> <s> as far as i understand it he is agreeing to general duties being imposed roughly in the terms of amendment no <e> <s> b but on the authorities and not on the operators <e>", "<cs> very much the same general duties were imposed on london regional <e>", "<cs> i add my thanks to the noble lord lord belstead both for the substance of the amendments and for bringing them forward at the committee stage with great effort on his behalf and on behalf of the department <e> <s> it has been extremely helpful that these are to be put into the bill at this stage so that we can look at the bill on report as it has been amended now to see whether any improvements need to be made <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly support this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that it is necessary to talk to the first part of the amendment subsection c because that has already been amply filled by the admirable amendments moved by the minister for which we are very grateful indeed <e> <s> however there is a point in subsection d to which i hope the minister will address himself <e> <s> this is the concept of a duty on the operators to co-operate <e> <s> this is very much less than we have been asking for <e> <s> i wonder whether the model in the local government act might be followed <e> <s> i know that nothing is precisely the same but a government amendment imposed on the local authorities a duty to co-operate in the abolition period <e> <s> i wonder whether something could be adapted from that bill otherwise there will not be any kind of imperative on the operators to co-operate with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that this matter has attracted the support of the noble lord lord mottistone even though it is only a special interest that has caught his attention <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what the noble lord lord ennals has said but i also wish to thank the minister for taking on board the special position of dial-a-ride in relation to mini-bus permits <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> i wish too to support the point dramatically made by the noble lord lord mottistone that it is odd that schemes for concessionary fares should be available in one part of the country but not in another <e> <s> whatever the law is at the moment could it not please be put right <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble baroness lady stedman and endorse what she said to the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour that it is the less agile of the public of whom we are thinking and not the severely disabled <e> <s> those very steep steps on most buses are very difficult to negotiate for a large section of the public which is less agile <e> <s> some of the handgrips are not well placed <e> <s> it is small things like that with which we are concerned <e>", "<cs> i confirm that they are not to be moved <e>", "<cs> may i thank the government for this massive rewriting of a large part of part v of this bill on travel concessions both for what they have done and for the way in which they have done it <e> <s> i think the notes on clauses which have been made available by courtesy of the noble lord the minister are quite admirable with their tables of new subsections derivations and main changes <e> <s> thus none <e>", "<cs> should we not be considering amendment no <e> <s> ac <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before the minister replies i can add my voice as my name is down to the amendment <e> <s> i am puzzled by the exclusive character of the words wholly or mainly and i wonder whether they will have any effect for instance on the provisions of clause where there is a duty imposed on local authorities to co-operate with one another so as to secure in the interests of ratepayers in their areas the best value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity of discussion on this amendment amendment no <e> <s> a to thank the noble lord the minister for having tabled amendment no <e> <s> which is in fulfilment of an undertaking that he gave to examine a point that i raised in committee <e> <s> the noble lord has met the point by this amendment and i wish to express my gratitude to him for that <e> <s> i should also like the minister to consider the point made by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> it seems to me most reasonable that amendment no <e> <s> should apply to all authorities and not just to non-metropolitan counties <e> <s> with that i should like to support what the noble lord has said and to thank the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make the position clear <e> <s> the noble lord is very kind to allow me to interrupt <e> <s> the code is only interim until the construction and use regulations for new vehicles come into effect <e> <s> thereafter the two will run side by side <e> <s> that is my understanding and i hope that it is the noble lords understanding too <e> <s> however it might involve a period of five years or more <e> <s> i am told that the lead time from regulations to a new bus in service may be several years <e> <s> to that extent the code of practice would perform a valuable interim service <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me and i am sorry for interrupting him but it is essential to follow the train of the argument <e> <s> the noble lord has left out one stage <e> <s> the first subsection says <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press this amendment if only because of the doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very kind indeed of the noble lord <e> <s> i express my deep gratitude <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add the thanks of the cross-benchers for this move <e> <s> i wonder whether this excellent change in the interests of equality would have been made had it not been for the backing of the noble lord lord mottistone and the fact that he lives in the isle of wight <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the minister says about the listing as a relevant offence when an operator wishes to apply for the renewal of his psv licence <e> <s> but i cannot accept that the systematic failure of an operator by way of a deliberate attempt or as a matter of deliberate policy to defraud by not complying with a local authority scheme is equal to an operator operating without a public service vehicle licence <e> <s> they seem to me to be quite different offences <e> <s> one is much graver than the other <e>", "<cs> i see my lords <e> <s> so what the noble lord is saying is that it could be fraudulent and that if it were then it could be subject to the sanctions for fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that it reassures me considerably <e> <s> but even so even if it were not fraudulent it still seems to me that a persistent offence of this sort is much worse to put it only mildly than an operator operating without a psv licence <e> <s> nevertheless i must not persist with this amendment because the other thing that the noble lord said about it being listed as a relevant offence when a renewal is applied for is a material consideration <e> <s> having raised the point i must beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth who unfortunately cannot be here this evening i should <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene at this stage to thank the minister once again on behalf of

amendments and to the minister for accepting them <e> <s> i must say this is a most remarkable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to express a word of support to the noble baroness congratulate her on her initiative and also of course congratulate the minister and thank him for encouraging the noble baroness to persist with this <e> <s> it is a remarkable event honestly not merely because it is to look after all road passenger transport for disabled people this bill is about road passenger transport but also because it is about public passenger transport in general <e> <s> that is what is so remarkable about it <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that this may be only possible in parliamentary terms to be done in the house of lords <e> <s> more restrictive rules as to the scope of the bill which is related to the long title in the house of commons would have made this impossible to introduce in that house <e> <s> so the noble baroness is to be congratulated for having made full use of the facilities of this house to propose this wide amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government do not consult both houses of parliament before reaching a voluntary agreement with the tobacco industry about sponsorship and advertising will they at least consult some friendly expert in public relations such as saatchi and saatchi so that they are not bamboozled

women <e> <s> there is no need to enlarge on the need for an improvement in the custodial treatment after what we have heard from the two noble baronesses this evening <e> <s> there is room for improvement not only for the women in prison but also for the staff <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was making was that all those whom i quoted are in office and are therefore official spokesmen whereas the noble earl i have always regarded as a voice crying in the wilderness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to follow the noble lord lord vinson if only to say that the noble and learned lord lord denning who is a great scintillating star in the field of the law does not twinkle quite so brightly in the field of parliamentary procedure <e> <s> i will leave it at that <e> <s> i

discussed in a debate initiated by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> in that debate the government were asked that there should be uniformity throughout statute law on codes of practice

carefully and i find that increasingly i come to the conclusion that paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to refer to the closing words of the noble lord lord mishcon when he referred to a paragraph in sir cyrils report which he could not find and which he paraphrased <e> <s> i very much agree that this is something which should be brought out into the open and recorded in

discussing he will find the power there <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in everything that he has said <e> <s> he has been most thorough and extensive in

to assure the house that by accepting any one or all of the three of my amendments the house would not be depriving people of the benefit of the governments amendment <e> <s> all that i am proposing is that the house should agree to the governments amendment but add <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount the leader of the house agree that the number of amendments made by this house of which the majority are always government amendments is an index of the succes with which the house performs its revising function and of the receptivity and flexibility of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to approach this important subject from a slightly different point of view from that of those who have already spoken though our objectives are no doubt much the same except for the views and objectives of the noble lord lord bauer who seems when he hears <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words following the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> he gave the impression that this was the end of the road <e> <s> well it is not <e> <s> there is a perfectly legitimate piece of parliamentary machinery for this house to insist on their amendment which the commons have disagreed to and then for the commons to consider that insistence and change its mind or not as the case may be <e> <s> all that this house is doing by listening to and perhaps voting on the amendment of the noble baroness is to exercise the perfectly legitimate constitutional machinery between the two houses <e> <s> i think that really disposes of the main argument of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord agrees that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order

centres of all towns and cities and is not the provision of these precincts both in the interests of the native citizen and the visiting tourist <e> <s> do they not do something to bring back the significance of the centres of our towns and cities <e> <s> further is it not time that london gave a lead in this matter <e> <s> after all at the royal academy as the minister will be aware mr rogers

have to jump for their lives if they wish to see big ben the palace of westminster and the abbey <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the government for their consideration of the needs of the disabled and the elderly to have access to these spaces but will the noble lord give some thought to the remark of the noble lord lord northfield that no progress will ever be made in the promotion of precincts for pedestrians in london unless the government take a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up a phrase which the noble baroness has just uttered <e> <s> she said that there is too much political interference i think she means in the teaching profession <e> <s> i agree with her <e> <s> i have different conclusions from hers though <e> <s> and i hope that this bill <e>",

boyd-carpenter for his contribution <e> <s> one is very unhappy that the law contained in a statute for subordinate legislation should be embodied elsewhere <e> <s> this is a most unsatisfactory

point <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me would it not be better to allow the question on amendment no <e> <s> to be put and when amendment no <e> <s> is then called he will have the right to speak on that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can help me <e> <s> i think that the only argument he advanced so far for rejecting the amendment which has been supported by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is the delay in the payment to teachers if there were to be affirmative rather than negative resolution procedures <e> <s> could the minister kindly say how much delay there would be <e> <s> i think that information would help the committee to make up its mind <e>", "<cs> it is beguiling of the minister to give some indication of a rather broader approach to future amendments and we look forward <e>", "<cs> i was just about to do so <e> <s> it has been suggested and i am quite happy about it that amendments nos <e> <s> to a b and to should all be discussed

amendments it is open to anyone to move them if they so wish <e> <s> so the noble lord will have the opportunity if he wishes when we come to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i can state that the opportunity will occur <e>", "<cs> yes i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i can help the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> the fault lies in the line numbering on page of the bill <e> <s> i believe that the amendment of the noble baroness lady seear should read <e>", "<cs> i shall not address myself to the merits of the matter <e> <s> the kind of arguments that i would have advanced have been advanced by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and others <e> <s> as to the procedural point raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i have to say that i agree with

amendment no <e> <s> and take the opinion of the house then <e> <s> for that reason i ask leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> without prejudice to its being raised again on report <e>", "<cs> i do not think i do <e> <s> i must say this comes to me as rather a shock <e> <s> i feel rather like king lear who had his possessions taken away from him by his daughters and said o reason not the need

short title could be used as an aid in interpretation so it is useless to put up that argument against the arguments that i proposed <e> <s> i merely said that it should be put in so that anyone who referred to this act by its handle that is what i cared to call it and not its nickname at once would be reminded of the fact that it was temporary <e> <s> people will not look at the long title but they will refer to the short title which i should have thought was a very good reason for including these words <e>", "<cs> i feel that i should press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like

vote <e> <s> i see them nodding and i am gratified that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby to plead very seriously with the right reverend prelate to withdraw his bill not just for the reasons which i have already adduced but because it is too complex a matter to be dealt with in a private members bill <e> <s> it simply seeks to amend the infant life preservation act <e> <s> but the abortion laws are highly complex and should not be disturbed without the greatest possible care and consultation <e>", "<cs> i wish to express an opinion contrary to that expressed by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> most bills start in the house of commons <e> <s> they go to standing committees

occurred only the other day <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i think that what he is saying is a trifle fanciful and clearly the important thing is that the government have the whiphand <e> <s> they can make it quite clear that if negotiations are not determined by the end of three years then they will promote fresh legislation so the noble lords rather fanciful scenario will not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have a right of reply which i should like to exercise briefly i assure the house <e> <s> i was disappointed by the reply of the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i had hoped that when he was coming to the points i made he would answer them <e> <s> the noble lord said that he would come to my point about precedents then he shied away from it <e> <s> i asked him specifically whether there is any precedent for an act which expressly declared itself to be temporary to have an indeterminate duration to it <e> <s> i still ask him that <e> <s> i know of no precedent <e> <s> i consider it to be an undesirable precedent indeed a dangerous one <e> <s> i can just imagine how the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would stand below the gangway on the other side of the house if such a bill were introduced by an extreme left-wing government <e> <s> he would say how constitutionally dangerous and damaging it was <e> <s> however here is a minister coming to parliament saying that he is only taking these powers temporarily but at the same time extending that power indefinitely <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord would use his great powers of advocacy to good effect in that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a brief word about the motion <e> <s> the right reverend prelate said that he moved the motion with deep feeling and a heavy heart <e> <s> i should like to say that i support the motion with deep feeling and a sigh of relief <e> <s> i say a sigh of relief because this is the very course which i recommended during second reading <e> <s> i do not often quote my own words but at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel that i need to apologise for raising this matter otherwise the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would have been the sole recipient of the valuable information that has just been vouchsafed to us by the noble baroness <e> <s> thus the house has benefited <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e> <s> would the noble lord care to assist me further in my speech <e> <s> i should be very happy if he would do so <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has just said that it is a serious point <e> <s> therefore it is sufficiently serious for me to put down an amendment to elicit a government reply <e> <s> i just wish to establish that there is nothing wrong with that indeed it has been a service to the house <e> <s> i see the minister nodding and i am very glad to have his confirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question about which the minister has received ample notice because i raised it on report <e> <s> is it well precedented for a bill to be expressed as temporary in the long title and to have an indefinite prolongation of its life as a possibillity in the duration clause <e> <s> of course i know that it has happened not often and rarely in time of peace that a bill has been expressed to last for the duration of an emergency and then to be extended by a year or two by affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have discovered from what the noble lord the minister has just said that there is in fact no precedent for a temporary provisions bill to have an indefinite duration in its duration clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps my hearing was impaired because i thought i heard the minister say that temporary provisions bills have contained the word temporary in the short title but not in the long title <e> <s> i do not think he answered my question the implication of which was that no bill which had the word temporary in the short title or the long title has so far as i know contained indefinite provisions in its duration clause <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to give me a precedent for this bill in that sense i will gladly give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the argument between us <e> <s> the noble lord has repeated the fact that there have been bills with the word temporary in the long title or the short title <e> <s> that does not seem to me to matter <e> <s> i think it should be in both but let us leave that point there <e>", "<cs> i am very hopeful that the minister will give a sympathetic reply to this amendment in view of the words of the minister for social security in another place mr john major on th february <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcgregor was rising to make an observation <e> <s> i thought that he was invisible to the noble lord in the chair <e>", "<cs> my lords i have hardly spoken on this bill but i have followed its proceedings with some care <e> <s> i would not have sought to speak on third reading but for the fact that i find myself in disagreement with what the noble baroness lady burton of coventry said on report and again today on third reading about the position of your lordships house <e> <s> she said today that this house had been slighted or perhaps eroded or possibly weakened by the conduct of the minister in this house and the government generally and particularly the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> may i briefly because the hour is late thank all those who have spoken in this important debate and in particular thank the minister who has just replied most generously <e> <s> there is no question that he is going to fulfil his undertaking to look at this whole matter seriously in the context of the principles of the bill <e>", "<cs> if it is a rebate up to per cent <e> <s> it is the same thing <e> <s> it does not mean that you have to do it to per cent <e> <s> just that you are able to do so <e> <s> that would give the minister sufficient flexibility <e>", "<cs> i think that is an entirely satisfactory conclusion to the debate <e> <s> i do not think that it is for me to withdraw the amendment at this stage but for the noble lord lord morton to withdraw his amendment to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> perhaps we can distinguish between planning and people <e> <s> this bill refers to people and not to those applying for planning permission <e> <s> to that extent i ask the minister to examine the whole of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies perhaps i may briefly say a word on what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has called the procedural point <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie when he introduced this amendment said quite frankly to the house that he did not propose to press it to a division <e> <s> then the noble lady lady saltoun quite rightly drew attention to the fact that this was a matter for the house of commons rather than for ourselves <e> <s> then i thought that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in his zeal to defend the house of commons financial privilege tended slightly to diminish the privilege of this house <e> <s> i am sure that he did so inadvertently but i rose so that we should not be misled into the suggestion which he made that we should not even discuss by way of amendment a matter which is a concern of the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the substance of the advice <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be inhibiting the proceedings of this house too greatly if we feared commons financial privilege to such an extent that we denied ourselves our privilege of discussing financial matters in the house which includes putting down amendments of this nature <e> <s> the commons financial privilege only attaches when we send such an amendment down to the house of commons if we do so <e> <s> until that happens and it will not happen in this case commons financial privilege does not arise <e> <s> the house is entirely in order in discussing this amendment <e> <s> if unfortunately we were to take the view that i understand the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to take we should inadvertently be diminishing the privileges of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that due gratitude has yet been expressed to the government for having fulfilled the undertaking which the noble lord lord glenarthur made at the committee stage late in the evening <e> <s> i think that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> although it was late at night i think that the sense of the house all round was that something should be done and the minister took this on hoard <e> <s> he has obviously had very deep and searching consultations in the department and has come up with a rather spectacular package so late in the parliamentary progress of the bill <e> <s> after all there is a section in the bill dealing with the mentally handicapped and a promise that regulations under clause will include the severely physically handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak briefly on this matter <e> <s> during the earlier stages of the bill i was concerned with the special provisions for the mentally handicapped and also for the physically handicapped both in this clause and in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry to interrupt but i believe that the noble lord has already spoken on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that only the minister may ask leave and that leave may not be given to anybody other than the minister <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved briefly but comprehensively by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i am sorry that i was not present at second reading but i read the debate with great interest <e> <s> i feel very strongly that this bill is entirely an all-party affair <e> <s> its provisions offer nothing but gain to the services with one exception <e> <s> the bill creates what i shall say are three categories but which i believe should be one category <e> <s> the benefits which are to be given under the bill prospectively should apply retrospectively from as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give the minister an opportunity to make a correction in something which he no doubt inadvertently said <e> <s> if i heard him correctly he said that the bill under discussion was a private bill whereas it is a private members bill <e> <s> if he agrees that that is the case does he also agree that as it is a public bill it has the same status a government bill <e> <s> the only difference is that is has been introduced by a private member <e> <s> there is just as much obligation on government to implement the provisions of private members bill as there is to implement a government bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the ministers reply but he has not answered the specific questions which i asked him <e> <s> those were why was it that after lord elton then parliamentary under-secretary of state for prisons announced that the home secretary would draw up or cause to be drawn up by the present department a code of practice a code of standards for publication during as a basis for discussion <e> <s> why was that not drawn up after we had been promised that it would be <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to those who have taken part in this debate and in particular to the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw who lifted the standard of discussion very high <e> <s> i also thought that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway spoke from experience and gave a new dimension to the debate <e> <s> i feel listening <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> i am most grateful for that constructive response <e> <s> frankly i should like to admit that the first part of my amendment is defective <e> <s> i agree that it is inappropriate to ordain in a statute as my amendment does in subsections and <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear of the recent improvements from the noble earl <e> <s> that is welcome <e> <s> implicit in the recent improvements is an admission of how bad conditions have been up to now <e> <s> i am glad that rigorous conditions are now imposed by a proper inspectorate <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble earl for saying that he will keep the matter under review and that he does not have a closed mind about the removal of crown immunity <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies i should like to support what the noble and learned lord lord silkin has just said and to remind the noble earl that it was no lesser a person <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to be the only person to speak who does not congratulate the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> i do so wholeheartedly and thank him for introducing this debate <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford and the noble lords lord basnett and lord blease have all spoken about the need for anti-discriminatory legislation <e> <s>

possible to be integrated into society <e> <s> they also have most frustrating problems which are often partly or wholly soluble in a wide range of activities i quote the bob wareing bill including <e>", "<cs> i find that a disappointing reply and it does not enable me to shorten my speech in winding up as a more favourable reply would have done <e>", "<cs> naturally i am most grateful to hear that from the noble baroness whose experience as we all know is extremely deep on this front <e> <s> what i am quoting from is a home office research and planning unit report made in <e> <s> it was specifically related to magistrates courts not the high court <e> <s> the findings are what i have quoted <e> <s> they are not my opinions <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear that <e> <s> i think that this is a matter of public confidence and that public confidence in the sentencing policy of magistrates courts and higher courts would be improved if this clause were inserted into the bill <e>", "<cs> i know that my amendment no <e> <s> has been grouped with this amendment but it might be more convenient to speak to it separately if only because it is not concerned with means but with disposable income <e> <s> i think they are separable and would be better treated separately <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for saying that the matter i have raised is most important unfortunately i do not think that i can thank him for his reply <e>", "<cs> surely it is worth making a guess <e> <s> is the noble lord being so complacent as to say that someone who has a disposable income of a year should not pay more than someone who is unemployed <e> <s> the whole point is that we wish to get at these arabian princes if i may recall the example given by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> let me give another example of a princely income <e> <s> it was that of <e>", "<cs> the court uses its best endeavours <e>", "<cs> you may say it guesses <e> <s> it makes an informed guess <e> <s> i am surprised at the noble lord <e> <s> he appears not to wish to help towards what we all wish to achieve <e> <s> we wish to see that the unemployed man with a small amount of money does not have an impossible fine imposed on him <e> <s> at the same time we wish to see that the arabian princes and the boy georges of this world pay whacking great fines <e> <s> i had hoped to recruit the noble lord towards that process <e> <s> i should have asked for his goodwill with some expectation of success <e> <s> it seems that that is not to be so <e> <s> i am happy to say that i have the goodwill of the government as evidenced in the remarkable words of mr mellor only six months ago in march <e> <s> that is support for the idea from the government which the noble lord supports <e> <s> however all we have had is cold water poured on the idea by the noble lord <e> <s> that seems to me to be a very great shame <e>", "<cs> it does not work saying those things <e> <s> as i have made absolutely clear the whole point is to attract a sympathetic answer from the minister in the same way that a sympathetic answer was attracted in another place from mr david mellor <e> <s> may i add that mr mellor said that the attractions of the scheme were such that it was well worth looking for a practical means of carrying it out <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for his answer and i fully accept that there are administrative and practical objections to what i propose <e> <s> i am very grateful to hear that the home office is setting up experimental projects <e> <s> i should have thought that if we knew what those projects were as the noble lord lord harris said we could have extracted some valuable information from him <e>", "<cs> i should like first of all to apologise for not being in my place when the noble baroness moved the amendment <e> <s> secondly i am most grateful to learn from the noble earl that the subject of these three amendments will be examined by mr carlisle when his committee is set up <e> <s> if that is so i am extremely grateful because all the amendments are concerned with points of importance <e> <s> it is especially important that sooner or later and the sooner the better an injustice which is perceived by the young people themselves and by their custodians should be removed <e> <s> young people in both categories in the same establishment are receiving different sentences <e> <s> that cannot be right <e> <s> one could have two people one over and one under receiving different sentences <e> <s> these three amendments have raised matters of great importance <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for his lengthy and considered reply <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness agrees but i feel that we must await the deliberations of the carlisle committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up the recollection of the noble earl lord longford as regards the then noble viscount lord hailsham moving that lord stansgate be no longer heard <e> <s> i remember that occasion well and lord stansgate was very downcast <e> <s> he was a miserable man on this bench below the gangway and deserted by his own front bench <e> <s> that is not a sight that i should like to see again <e> <s> i have never heard that motion moved to good effect and i should like to regard it as the nuclear weapon which should be in reserve but never used <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but afterwards he was an extremely miserable and lonely old man <e> <s> of course he bounced back again but that is what one would have expected of him <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to disagree with something which the noble earl has just said but i would not myself commend the words of the statute book of years ago <e> <s> in chapter of the renton report we quote the words of thomas jefferson <e> <s> he was looking at the statute book of that day <e> <s> i shall not quote the very words but i strongly recommend them to the attention of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords that includes four seconded to the law commissions for consolidation <e> <s> is it the case that the complement of parliamentary counsel was increased to in september as the noble lord lord belstead said was the aim <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl spell out what that difference of principle is <e> <s> that is what i find difficult <e> <s> i cannot see why what is effective for young offenders cannot be effective also for adult offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i still do not see that there is any principle stated <e> <s> if one extends the purport of clause to adults it is suggested that one would somehow dim the spotlight which is on young offenders <e> <s> it does not seem to me to dim it in the very least <e> <s> it seems to me to be really a logical progression to move from the original provisions to clause and then to extend it to adults as i have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl very much for moving this amendment and the subsequent consequential amendment <e> <s> it is only fair that that should be done <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord irvine of lairg would wish to be associated with my thanks <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord said <e> <s> i think he has deployed all the arguments and i can add little except to say that it looks to me as if the nottingham justices supported by lord justice donaldson in the court of appeal have overturned the wishes of parliament <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> the wishes of parliament are that remand hearings should be held every eight days <e> <s> that decision has effectively overridden the wishes of parliament <e> <s> it cannot be right that a judicial decision should do that <e> <s> this is the shortest and plainest expression of our dissatisfaction with what the nottingham justices have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord monson <e> <s> i believe that there is a committee under the chairmanship of mr peter brooke looking at this matter at the moment <e> <s> it will no doubt

will find time <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble lord to withdraw the imputation that noble lords who have spoken are not concerned about the detection of people carrying drugs into the country <e> <s> i think that that was unworthy of him <e>", "<cs> my lords too have not spoken on this amendment <e> <s> i should like to put one question which arises out of the reply of the noble earl <e> <s> i take the point that he is going to experiment to see whether or not this provision clause does or does not increase the number of prisoners on remand <e> <s> whether or not it does indubitably it does diminish civil rights <e> <s> that was also the case in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was properly rebuked by the minister for not mentioning the act when i spoke to that clause <e> <s> but the fact is that both amendment no <e> <s> and clause represent a diminution of civil rights and i do not believe there is any gainsaying that <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> so far as i can see the noble baroness is correct to bring this up <e> <s> i can only conclude that it is by some oversight or hole in the procedure that the periodic crown review does not take place in these cases <e> <s> if that is so perhaps the minister will consider introducing a provision to meet the case so ably put by the noble baroness <e> <s> although the words of the amendment may not be entirely right to fill the hole i hope that something can be done before the bill leaves the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned severely disabled people in his original reply <e> <s> can i ask why the government appear to have substituted a rebate of per cent <e> <s> through the benefit system for the undertaking given by the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor aware that there is a joint committee composed of members of both houses charged with the function of examining statutory instruments and in particular whether their drafting appears to be effective <e> <s> if it is considered desirable which it is that there should be scrutiny of the drafting of subordinate legislation is it not equally if not more desirable that there should be scrutiny of the drafting of primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to follow my noble friend lord buckmaster who has just spoken except to say that i consider that he is perhaps rather bold to say in the presence of the most reverend primate that the proposals which have been carefully circumscribed in this paper if implemented would be a sin <e> <s> i thought that the most reverend primates speech was the most important of the very many splendid speeches that have been made today <e> <s> i should like to thank him for it <e> <s> it has certainly clarified the moral issue in my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> of course i accept what he says <e> <s> i do not believe that any of us have been addressing the question of the most radical proposals because we all agree that they should be excluded by statute <e> <s> this is therefore an issue that does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> it is only too easy to descend averno <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl knows quite well that i mean no such thing <e> <s> i have drawn a distinction between the utterance of the most reverend primate who did not base his arguments on belief and those of the noble duke the duke of norfolk who expressly based his arguments on belief and authority <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue the matter further but i draw that distinction between them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that positive answer <e> <s> i also thank him for his responsiveness to a debate in this house which called for clarification of the drafting of codes of practice <e> <s> might i ask the noble and learned lord whether the paragraph in the explanatory and financial memorandum on clause of the local government bill now before this house should not be the model for the future <e> <s> if he has been good enough to do that for this particular bill i cannot understand and may i ask him why he cannot do the same for future bills as well <e> <s> it would he a great help to legislators <e>", "<cs> as i have my name down for this amendment i think that it is only customary to allow those who have their name down to speak to the amendment <e> <s> i ask for the indulgence of the committee in that respect <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness confirm what she said or withdraw it about the borough of lambeth <e> <s> my investigations prove that what she said was founded on wrong information <e> <s> i believe that my informaton is rather better than hers <e>", "<cs> i do not think this is a novelty <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that there used to be local control about the opening of pubs <e> <s> that no longer exists but there certainly is a precedent for it <e> <s> i am not recommending it particularly but it is going in the right direction <e> <s> as my noble friend lord monson said it is at least asking the people what they want to have in their district instead of the government dictating whatever they may or may not have <e>", "<cs> i should just like to answer the right reverend prelate with regard to the word homosexuality <e> <s> that point was raised in the earlier debate <e> <s> it was raised by myself among others and i described homosexuality as an abstract concept which meant nothing <e> <s> i very much take the point made by the right reverend prelate and i give notice to the minister that i shall be moving an amendment to delete homosexuality and to put in homosexual acts or words to that effect at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i am happy to see the right reverend prelate nodding and hope that i may have his support when i come to that amendment <e>", "<cs> there should not be any doubt at all but the fact is that there is a fear <e> <s> there was an unsuccessful attempt made in amendment no <e> <s> to do something of this kind and it is very valuable that the noble lord lord peston has brought in amendment no <e> <s> which i consider to be rather better though i should not be willing to pawn its worth <e>", "<cs> one of the things worrying the theatre is the fact that there will be two laws a play will not be censored if it is not promoted by a local authority but it will be censored if it is <e> <s> that surely is an undesirable situation to have one law for plays that are put on or promoted by local authorities and another law for those which are not so promoted <e> <s> it may be the very same play <e>", "<cs> there is this point of censorship <e> <s> this is how it will come about <e> <s> a local authority will say we shall not put on maurice <e> <s> goodness me no otherwise someone will prosecute us <e> <s> therefore one will have censorship in that form <e> <s> it will not be put on because somebody will prosecute <e> <s> it will be a fear of prosecution by the local authority that will stop it putting on a perfectly reputable play because some busybody will take it to court waste ratepayers money and the courts time in finding out whether or not the intention is there in putting on a single production of maurice <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford has put his finger on a most important point <e> <s> there is another aspect of this matter <e> <s> those charged by the council by hmi and the department of education and science with the task of counselling will be afraid to do it in relation to homosexuality in case just this sort of thing happens <e> <s> they will be afraid to carry out their proper task of counselling <e> <s> i ask the noble earl to consult with the department of education and science and ask it whether or not it has fears because there is a hmi publication dated called <e>", "<cs> i regard this amendment as one of the most important of all the amendments <e> <s> i very much regret that it has been so arranged that it is discussed at or after midnight <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord gifford for giving us the benefit of his experience in the european court <e> <s> what he said is most important and i am very glad he has taken this opportunity of saying it so that it is on the record <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene this is my first intervention <e> <s> primary and secondary legislation are not mutually exclusive <e> <s> it would be perfectly possible to put into the primary legislation the kind of categories which are embodied in the amendment of the noble lord lord pitt and then to fill out the safety net in the regulations <e> <s> this is what we want to know <e> <s> the cardinal principles should be put into the primary legislation and then the subordinate principles <e> <s> these will be very important and no doubt we should all very much like to see them as the noble earl lord selkirk has quite properly suggested <e> <s> they support the principles which are stated in the bill <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that i was not here when the noble lord lord banks rose to move the amendment so i am not sure whether it was agreed to take my amendment no <e> <s> with it <e> <s> the amendments are slightly different <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> if that is the case i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is slightly more particular <e> <s> the amendment seeks to insert at page line after circumstances the words <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might answer the first question put by the noble baroness about the number of people in the category concerned <e> <s> i can give that information fairly precisely because an official survey was carried out admittedly in and so it is a little out of date by the national bureau of handicapped students on behalf of the des <e> <s> it estimated that there were approximately disabled young people in public sector further and higher education of which approximately were full-time students <e> <s> but of those were on youth training schemes and approximately and year-olds were not yet on yts but receiving supplementary benefit while on college special courses <e> <s> the answer to the noble baroness is that there are about such people <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord banks decides how to proceed with his amendment perhaps i may reply to the minister on my amendment <e> <s> he said that the msc is not aware of any difficulties in this area <e> <s> perhaps it may be blind but there are difficulties <e> <s> one of the difficulties is this <e> <s> one cannot expect the people about whom we are talking or very often their parents they may be single parents harassed or disadvantaged to understand the fundamental principle which the noble lord enunciated that income support was not intended for those in receipt of education <e> <s> it is that kind of principle which is very hard for such people to comprehend <e>", "<cs> may i just say a few words partly for personal reasons <e> <s> it so happens that today i had my teeth dealt with by a compatriot of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> while i was waiting for the injection to take effect i spoke to his dental assistant <e> <s> i asked whether she enjoyed working in central london <e> <s> she said she did not actually enjoy it but she did it for the money <e> <s> she came all the way from dagenham <e> <s> it took her one-and-a-half hours to get to central london and two hours to return standing all the way and incidentally standing all the time she was attending my estimable dentist <e> <s> she did that because there was no employment in dagenham comparable to what she had in central london <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i think the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has put his finger on an important point that of delay <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk has also brought out the fact that unless we know what the regulations are we cannot understand how they will work <e> <s> i should like the minister to explain he was going rather fast but i know the hour is late because at one point he said that the adjudication officer would make his decision with or without discretion as appropriate <e> <s> i could not quite follow what those words meant <e> <s> i should be very grateful if the minister could expand on them <e>", "<cs> if no other member of the committee wishes to pursue the discussion perhaps i might say something <e> <s> the words of the minister are i believe comforting <e> <s> if it really is the case that decisions can be made in such a short time i am inclined to feel that this is not quite such a great problem as i thought it was <e> <s> however i shall read the ministers very hastily delivered brief in <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we cannot accept that <e> <s> if that is the question before the committee then i shall move that this question be now adjourned until tomorrow <e>", "<cs> it certainly does <e> <s> i should like to consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks has very clearly articulated the main reasons that there is great concern about the operation of the social fund <e> <s> if the minister will not accept this amendment i ask him to say in what form he proposes to make available to the public the rather wider information and statistics that he said the government will produce <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may thank the minister for his undertaking as regards publication <e> <s> can he confirm that he meant annual publication rather than publication from time to time <e> <s> also will he give consideration to the laying of that information before parliament and its being properly numbered in the command series so that it can be laid before parliament annually rather than simply put in the libraries of both houses <e>", "<cs> i shall read very carefully what the noble lord has said and i accept that the purpose of this amendment is not achieved by its wording <e> <s> for that reason alone i shall withdraw it but i hope he will understand that there will need to be a monitoring system which is operated by a court of appeal <e> <s> otherwise there is no proper check on the discretionary awards by the social security people the social fund officers <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse every word that the noble lord lord ennals has put before the committee and to support the amendment as the noble lord lord swinfen has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put my name to the amendment although i refrained from putting my name to a similar amendment at committee stage <e> <s> i refrained largely for the reasons which have been deployed by the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i feel that the act however splendid it was in its day is now defunct and ought to be repealed <e> <s> i do not think that it is sensible to regard a per cent <e> <s> quota as a target <e> <s> by and large it is an unattainable target <e> <s> that is true at least partly for the reasons which the noble lord lord campbell has already stated it literally cannot be fulfilled <e> <s> the reason is that the number of registered i place emphasis on that word disabled people is not sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to congratulate the noble viscount lord colville <e> <s> on his fine report <e> <s> we have all had the benefit of reading it <e> <s> it was published before christmas <e> <s> i regret most bitterly with the noble lord lord mishcon that the report of the noble viscount for was in our hands only about an hour ago <e> <s> i note that the report is dated nd february so the noble viscount cannot be blamed for this <e> <s> why it has taken from nd february to pm on th february for the report to reach us i am at a loss to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this proposed grouping could be said to have been agreed because i certainly was not consulted <e> <s> i did not receive my copy of the groupings until half-past seven tonight <e> <s> i would have wished to reserve my right to move any amendments i deem suitable to be moved separately rather than have them grouped as the noble earl has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment of the noble earl and to say that amendments nos <e> <s> and could i think be taken with this amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i regard this amendment as a damage limitation exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to answer my other question which i specifically put to him <e> <s> it was whether the word promote had been used in a statute or legislation in conjunction with an abstract concept <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a question which i raised in committee so i had hoped that the noble earl would have had an answer by the report stage <e> <s> i am very grateful to him however for giving me the opportunity of receiving a letter or some kind of communication from him in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> however he has not answered my question as to whether he agrees with the noble lord lord skelmersdale that acceptability is a word to occupy your lordships sitting in your judicial capacity for hour after hour <e> <s> does the noble earl agree or not agree with his noble friend lord skelmersdale <e> <s> i see that the noble earl is not prepared to answer that question and he has not answered other similar questions which i have asked throughout our proceedings today <e> <s> that is indicative of the curious nature of this rather ugly clause <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble earl has referred to the sponsors of the bill as if they are not the government <e> <s> what is the distinction between the sponsors of the bill and the sponsors of this clause which appears in a government bill <e> <s> what is the distinction between the sponsors and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is speaking to the wrong amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of good sense has been spoken by the noble lord lord kilmarnock who moved this amendment and by my noble friend who has just spoken <e> <s> i apologise i am not referring to the noble baroness but to the noble lord lord birkett who is sitting beside me <e>", "<cs> my lords that amounts to the fact that the government like to have belt and braces when concerned with their own amendments but wish to deny belt and braces to those of us who wish to reassure the public of other amendments <e> <s> i am happier to have heard that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was delighted to hear the noble lord lord campbell of alloway say that everyone knows that the words as it sees fit do not mean what they appear to mean <e> <s> that recalled to me the extraordinary word pretended used elsewhere in the bill which clearly does not mean what everyone thinks it does <e> <s> i wish that the word pretended had been amended <e> <s> in seeking to amend the expression now being discussed the noble lord lord airedale has hit on a very happy solution <e> <s> he has received support from all sides of the house and i very much hope that the minister will accept this improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words because i also am puzzled about the scheme <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords are grateful to the government for having made available million for disabled people <e> <s> i am sorry that it has not been possible to put that into statutory form and on a permanent basis <e> <s> i should like to know what will happen after the scheme ends in as would the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i presume that it is a stop-gap scheme put into effect while the government consider a proper permanent basis upon which to bring the severely disabled back into the statutory framework <e>", "<cs> my lords i made a suggestion at the last stage of the bill which was taken up by the minister in a circulated letter <e> <s> it was that the cardinal principles should be listed in the bill <e> <s> i put my name to this amendment because i thought that it was worth bringing it before the house again in an attempt to have the cardinal principles included in the bill <e> <s> i wonder why they cannot be so included <e> <s> i appreciate that the regulations are still in the process of being drafted <e> <s> i do not wish to impose any sense of rush on the drafting of amendments but the minister surely knows what the cardinal principles are <e> <s> is it not preferable for them to be included in the bill <e> <s> i appeal to him to do this on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice in support of the amendment <e> <s> i gave way just now so that the greater authority of the noble lord lord seebohm could be heard <e> <s> his name was after all on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but which remark did i not understand <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very difficult sentence to understand even at second utterance <e> <s> there are double if not triple negatives <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords translation on the hoof was admirable <e> <s> i was able to understand it the third time as the result of his explanation <e> <s> i believe that the answers to my two questions are satisfactory <e> <s> i shall read closely what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i thank him for having said it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that the reason i put my name to the amendment was that i wanted to make sure that it is the case if indeed it is that social fund officers are subject to the parliamentary commissioner in respect of maladministration <e> <s> if the minister can reassure us about that i shall be happy and i also hope that he can reassure us about whether the social fund commissioner himself is subject to the parliamentary commissioner in respect of maladministration <e>", "<cs> my lords does that include the social fund commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would be very kindly consider whether it would be desirable for the social fund commissioner to be subject to the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> if one of his functions is to review decisions i should have thought that he should be subject to the parliamentary commissioner because i believe that he could though i do not know in what circumstances be guilty of maladministration in which case he ought to be subject to the parliamentary commissioners scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that such an amendment would be tabled by the minister bearing in mind the general tone and tenor of debate in committee and the way in which he received the comments of noble lords from all sides of the house <e> <s> that said i am grateful to the noble lord lord banks for having tabled the amendment <e> <s> it may give the minister an opportunity to say that he is able to agree with the spirit of it and on third reading will bring forward an amendment of his own drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i remember the occasion as clearly as the noble lords lord banks and lord ennals <e> <s> it was on the assurance of the noble baroness that the amendment was not pressed <e> <s> i am not clear from the noble lords answer whether he is saying that the noble baroness accurately predicted what is going to happen and that the social fund is not to be cash limited in its early stages <e> <s> if that is so we can be content <e> <s> if it is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just one word <e> <s> i think that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i should first apologise to the noble lord lord basnett for not being in my place when he rose to move his proposal for insistence <e> <s> as noble lords would expect i am very much in agreement with the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord campbell of croy because for some time now i have been campaigning for the repeal of the act in that arithmetically it is no longer possible to comply with it <e> <s> for that reason i think that it is a prime example for a statute law repeal and does positive harm to the cause of the disabled <e> <s> i differ from my colleagues who are interested in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in any event the amendment like the dog registration amendment is not mandatory it is discretionary <e> <s> it seems to me that if the government are to take that view in regard to the dog registration amendment they may well take the same view on this one and let the local authorities decide whether they will avail themselves of the powers which the amendment provides that indeed they could comply with the governments policy and promote that of the msc <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down does she agree that the proposed review by the secretary of state for employment mentioned by the secretary of state for the environment which i find extremely welcome is not in any way incompatible with the amendment <e> <s> they are not mutually exclusive <e> <s> they are both as she said a means to an end <e> <s> why not allow them both <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by referring to the speech of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson who spoke immediately after the noble and learned lord lord brightman and to the remarks that he made about the procedure of parliament and the conventions of this house <e>", "<cs> having said that my lords i hope that the leader of the house or the minister when he comes to reply will confirm my understanding of the parliamentary convention <e> <s> i should like to instance just one of several occasions in which bills on the same subject have proceeded simultaneously in both houses <e> <s> in particular i recollect the bill on the protection of birds <e> <s> the bill was rather quaintly and happily introduced in the house of commons by the noble baroness lady tweedsmuir who was then a member of another place and simultaneously introduced in the house of lords by the noble lord lord tweedsmuir <e> <s> that did not trouble either house of parliament then and it should not trouble either of them now <e>", "<cs> my lords my purpose is not to misrepresent the noble and learned lord but what he said is within the recollection of the house <e> <s> not only i but other members of the house were fully under the impression that the noble and learned lord was saying that it was beyond the competence of the house <e>", "<cs> and against the convention of the house that it should continue to discuss a bill on the same subject as a bill that had been introduced into another place and that the house should observe the convention that on second reading noble lords do not oppose bills coming from another place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very hard act to follow <e> <s> instead i propose to make reference to the debate which preceded this one because i believe that it is a happy coincidence that that debate on productivity should take place on the same day as the one on the excellent <e>", "<cs> there is one other matter which has not yet been raised and which should be mentioned <e> <s> the clause is grossly discriminatory against those of us who happen to be heterosexual and could be construed as promoting homosexuality <e> <s> clause of an earlier bill was designed to prevent local authorities promoting homosexuality <e> <s> we know as a matter of fact that there are homosexual couples who will not be caught by clause s joint and several liability <e> <s> i am one of those who is happily married heterosexually <e> <s> i must say i do not care that the government should now promote homosexuality in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the success of the pilot bail information schemes which were jointly undertaken by the probation service and the vera institute of justice may i ask this question <e> <s> will her majestys government consider expanding the number of such schemes more widely than was indicated by the noble lord in his answer especially in the metropolitan areas <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the support from all around the house it seems inconceivable that the noble baroness will not take the amendment away and consider it sympathetically <e> <s> so much of the governments advocacy of the bill has been in support of parents and governors <e> <s> good parents on governing bodies of schools would require this to be done <e> <s> it must be right to have central direction of this kind of statistical material not merely for the benefit of a particular school or for the benefit of the parents of a child who has been absent but because as the noble baroness lady faithfull said this matter goes far wider than the educational aspects of the amendment <e> <s> there is also the social aspect <e> <s> if a child is in trouble the case conference will want to know whether a child and members of its peer group have been absenting themselves from school and whether parents know of their children absenting themselves <e> <s> this statistical material is essential for social as well as educational purposes <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will be able to come back at third reading with something which satisfies the demand from all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble baroness is being as accommodating as she can be in the circumstances <e> <s> i would not dream of pressing this amendment <e> <s> on the other hand i would be very much happier if it was she who came back on third reading rather than i and hope that she will consider doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> other amendments to the same effect have been scattered through the bill <e> <s> i believe that this is one of the most important places where it should be provided that the governing bodies should have the expertise that is required <e> <s> i cannot believe that it could be opposed on any ground other than perhaps that the governing bodies already have such powers or duties but if they do not already have such powers or duties i think they ought to be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords after the powerful advocacy of the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton it is hardly necessary for me to add my voice to their pleas asking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to be sympathetic in his reception of the amendment so comprehensively and ably moved by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for bringing the amendment forward and also for the manner in which he has done so <e> <s> i believe it to be a most important consideration especially as it is not provided for in the scottish legislation and was not provided for in the english legislation when it was first introduced <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord harris that it is important for us to know why there was this change of mind by the government while the bill was going through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> clearly the intention of the amendment was to spell out and amplify the provisions of the act <e> <s> however i accept what the minister has said <e> <s> she has made it clear that the intention of the amendment is fulfilled by the provisions of the act and that local education authorities already have the duty which the amendment desires to provide for them <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend

lords and join them in trying to dissuade the noble lord lord mcintosh from pressing the amendment to a division and in asking him to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is particularly difficult for me to follow the noble baroness and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington both of whom have spoken about the young adult the subject on which i wish to concentrate <e> <s> i agree very largely

renton that if it is to be in the bill it should be in part ii rather than part iii <e>", "<cs> following the noble lords remarks can the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor say whether local authorities would have the power to make the provisions in subsections and if the words were not there unless this amendment is accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the ministers reply a trifle disappointing in view of the recent most welcome emphasis by the prime minister on the importance of family planning and containment of the world population in the context of environmental pollution

department of health and social security in <e>", "<cs> as my name is down for this amendment perhaps i may briefly support it <e> <s> i believe that it is only a small step in the direction that we have already taken <e> <s> it is no more than a logical extension of the abolition of corporal punishment in state schools to state care <e> <s> it is entirely appropriate that this extension should

fallen from the noble baroness and challenge her statement that it is not for this chamber to propose anything to do with finance <e> <s> it is indeed a part of the duty of this chamber if it so wishes to make such proposals <e> <s> we may propose but it is for the commons to dispose <e> <s> i do not think that we should limit ourselves in that regard <e> <s> i feel sure that having said that the noble baroness will agree that we are not in any way trespassing on the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment on two grounds first on the ground of accountability of the executive to parliament and secondly to reinforce what i said earlier to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway that we should not be frightened by the pretext if i may put it in that way of the government that we should not concern ourselves with money matters <e> <s> in this case we can do so because the matter is only incidental to the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> as my name is also down to this amendment i should like to add that i am in some doubt as to its effect <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor whether the effect of this would extend to foster parents <e> <s> i believe that the amendment would allow the common law right of parents to use reasonable force on their children to remain <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunt would very much have liked to be here because he is interested in intermediate treatment rather than institutional treatment for children <e> <s> the amendment which has been so briefly but

part ill lays a general duty on every local authority to provide services for children in need <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord might consider that the amendment is in line with the admirable drafting practice used in clause at the beginning of part iii <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble and learned lord a question before he sits down <e> <s> is a duty laid upon any person the local authority or the court to acquaint the child with his rights in that respect <e> <s> if not how is a child to know of his rights <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a trifle daunting to

question <e> <s> is he confident that a court would be driven to read clause in conjunction with clause without recourse to <e>", "<cs> my lords on the merits of the case i have something to say although not on the drafting <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will consider this sympathetically <e> <s> it seems to me that when a child is what we would now call a

more than ones life was worth let alone ones fatherhood to dare to call a person of or years a child and not to give paramountcy to his wishes in circumstances where he does not have a father or mother to look to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a brief word <e> <s> it seems to me important that the carer should not be called parent because it is frequently his duty to maintain or promote the childs links with his family <e> <s> it would be very confusing if the carer were known in many cases as daddy or mummy rather than something like uncle or a christian name <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very hard to follow such a moving speech <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will command assent both from the heart of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and from his head <e> <s> he will appreciate that this amendment is logical in that it completes the work of parliament which has prohibited corporal punishment in the public education of children <e> <s> it also completes the work of the government who are already committed to banning corporal punishment in community homes <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the noble baroness lady elliot who talked about violence in society <e>

family and that the amendment is not about the family at all <e> <s> those comments are therefore totally irrelevant to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one of those fortunate enough to meet those young people <e> <s> like the noble lord lord prys-davies i was both touched and moved by what they said about their experiences when leaving care <e> <s> it is incredible that they said most eloquently and vociferously that they were pushed out of care when they were not ready to be on their own <e> <s> they were not consulted <e> <s> a number of them said that they would have liked an opportunity to decide for themselves when they were ready to leave care <e> <s> that is a very important point which has been running through the considerations of this bill <e> <s> some of us have pressed that the childs point of view when leaving care should be taken into account and should have very high if not paramount importance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord one question because we are all concerned about the fact that these children after leaving care will fall between the children bill and the social security bill <e> <s> if by chance and as we hope the social security legislation is amended to help these young people it might appear that the local authoritys duties would be consequentially diminished because of the condition in clause a <e>

consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down <e> <s> perhaps i might ask him to address his mind to one aspect of amendment no <e> <s> a to which the noble baroness lady faithful <e> <s> has spoken <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord has sympathy with the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> does he not agree that if the amendment is not accepted there is a risk that some courts could use a new power to remove young people from home for minor offences where they have no power to do so at present <e> <s> if as i believe is the case that is so is it not going against all trends of penal policy as expressed by the home office <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord mishcon in calling for a separate annual affirmative resolution for a statutory instrument to review quite separately from the main provisions of the bill part ii relating to exclusion <e> <s> i should like to make clear that i believe the power should be retained for the time

government for including the words temporary provisions in the short title of the bill <e> <s> i believe that that was against the advice of the noble earl lord jellicoe and his report and also against the advice of the noble viscount lord colville <e> <s> though the act will not last for four or five years but indefinitely subject to affirmative resolution i am sure that it is right to include those words to mark its exceptional nature <e>", "<cs> my lords this has rightly been a serious and solemn debate <e> <s> i hope i might be forgiven for striking a slightly frivolous note at the outset of my speech <e> <s> hearing the noble earl lord longford say that he could not recognise a roman catholic when he saw one it seemed to me rather a good idea that when the noble duke summons cajoles or marshals which might be the right word his troops they should all be distinctively dressed in the papal uniform of the guard of the vatican <e> <s> that would add to the gaiety of life in this house and match this chamber <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford would then be able to recognise his co-religionists <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord to the race relations act

withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in something of a quandary because the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord pitt both spoke strongly in favour of amendment no <e> <s> and wished to see the word language in the bill <e> <s> on the other hand i feel that the noble and learned lord has been so accommodating that it would be churlish not to accept his undertaking which i found strongly reinforced what he said earlier <e> <s> he said that the matters contained in the amendments would certainly be the subject of guidance by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that clarification and once again i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down will he not express a view as i requested about the governments opinion of what should be the law as opposed to what is the law about the corporal punishment of children by persons <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord have a statement to make about the governments policy in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that together with the noble baroness lady elliot i found that reply most disappointing <e> <s> i did so especially in

cautiously <e> <s> i am sure he will <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly glad to follow the noble baroness in this debate in that she drew attention to the admirable television programme last sunday by esther rantzen <e> <s> that gives me the opportunity to congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on his timing <e> <s> perhaps he will benefit from the glamour of esther rantzens programme and perhaps some publicity will be given to this debate which focused her general concern with mental illness on this particular problem which as we have heard affects over a quarter of a

faithfull said it is a national scandal and one hopes that it will be phased out as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> what is the minister prepared to do about it <e> <s> he recognises the problem and says that the amendment is inadequate for certain reasons which i and others in the committee i am sure understand <e> <s> but he cannot leave the matter simply saying that the amendment is inadequate <e>

my thanks to the minister of state and mr nicholas scott for receiving the noble baroness lady faithfull and myself on fairly similar matters a few months ago <e> <s> i should like to thank them for

to press the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for what he said <e> <s> i recognise that the opcs has yet to deliver its final report <e> <s> we should perhaps respond to the minister with a plea for time to consider the matter in the context of other cases <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes and add two points to what has been said <e> <s> first this proposal is consistent with the treatment accorded to war disablement pensioners and war widows by the inland revenue in that war disablement pensions and war widows pensions are disregarded for the purposes of assessing income tax <e> <s> therefore what the noble baroness proposes is consistent with existing practice <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i did not find that reply very convincing <e> <s> surely it is not for the department to decide who is and who is not susceptible to the jurisdiction of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> that must be a matter which is decided independently of the department <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which has been going on for well over a year now <e> <s> surely it is time that we reached a conclusion <e> <s> perhaps we can reach a definite conclusion on report <e> <s> with that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not at all wish to press this amendment <e> <s> i want the minister to do something about the tragic situation which has come about since th april <e> <s> however what the minister is doing is washing his hands of this problem <e> <s> the government are washing their hands

is doing absolutely nothing <e> <s> i gave him the opportunity in committee to come back and do something <e>", "<cs> my lords meanwhile the health problem which was referred to by the noble lord lord winstanley and buttressed by what the noble baroness lady faithfull said about the suffering of mothers and children remains <e> <s> is the noble lord content that that should be so <e> <s> there is the concealed cost in future social services to redeem the lack of imagination by the government to deal with this parlous situation <e> <s> there is concealed cost and continuing health problems but

fact that he has this matter at heart <e> <s> i very much welcome that <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i briefly supported the noble baroness and i should like to voice my support this evening <e>

the noble baroness and the minister and the government should generously accede to what she proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the report stage of the bill <e> <s> the only noble lord who can speak more than once with the leave of the house is the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he has not answered my question <e> <s> it was whether he would submit this <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that i find that as unsatisfactory as the reply given me in committee <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady jeger said this is not confined solely to the fund officers <e> <s> it is a matter of much wider importance and this is a particular example that i am drawing to the attention of the house <e> <s> generally speaking the interpretation of the bill when enacted cannot be left in the hands of the government <e> <s> it must be decided by an independent judge <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not these amendments are well drafted or acceptable to the government they have at least served the purpose of stimulating a debate in this house of over one hour <e> <s> there have been speeches from all round the house <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble lord lord skelmersdale has listened in particular to the words of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who asked him not to dismiss the feeling and the thought underlying these amendments and said that they had the support of everyone in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow the noble earl in his charming and amusing anecdotage <e> <s> but it has nothing to do with the bill in front of us to which i now wish to return <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that none of us would have wished to miss the past minutes <e> <s> however i wish to confine my remarks to the bill <e> <s> before doing so i thank the minister for the personal qualities that he brings to the front bench and the dispatch box <e> <s> i believe that his equability remained unruffled despite some occasional provocation <e> <s> as regards board and lodging i very much hope that the noble lord and his department will not forget the distress in the house concerning the eating-out allowance <e> <s> that is something <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> adjudicators have been excluded from the jurisdiction of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> as the social fund officers were akin to them they too have been excluded <e> <s> i ask again my question to which i am sure the noble lord will now have an answer <e> <s> who made that decision about the adjudicators and in what circumstances <e> <s> was it made by judicial authority or by the civil service department <e> <s> this matter is not just of local importance <e> <s> it is not confined to the department of social security and to this category of officer <e> <s> it is a matter of general public importance <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what the noble lord has to say in reply <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i could add my voice to those who have moved and supported the amendment <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as the mover of the amendment which prompted the minister to make the promise that there would be talks i should say that i withdrew it on the assumption that the offer would be honoured <e> <s> therefore i am glad to hear that these talks have been initiated <e> <s> however can we know how many departments are involved in the inter-departmental discussions and with which voluntary organisations <e> <s> further can the noble lord say how soon these people are expected to report and when we can expect some action <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord kindly see that a copy is printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to follow the noble baroness in what she said about the young especially as i am chairman of an organisation called action on youth crime which aims to keep young people over the age of and under the age of out of the criminal justice system <e> <s> much of what the noble baroness said about the younger age groups applies also to this age group <e> <s> i endorse what she said about lead departments and i hope that the minister will pass on those remarks to his friends in the administration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wish to raise one matter <e> <s> i appreciate that he cannot refer to every subject covered during the course of the debate <e> <s> however i mentioned at length the question of violence in the family and he has not referred to that <e> <s> the department of health must be the lead department in that respect because it wrote to epoch <e> <s> it stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to apologise to the noble earl lord ferrers for having missed the beginning of his remarks <e> <s> however i was present in the chamber in time to hear the greater part of his speech <e> <s> i thank him for the tone and temper of what he said <e> <s> it is a tone and temper which has informed the debate ever since <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take us right back to the beginning of the debate and like the noble lord lord ennals pay a compliment to the government on the prelegislative processes which have preceded the publication of the bill <e> <s> to my mind starting with the report of the noble baroness lady warnock and going through <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may enter this argument

hope that the noble lord lord rippon will not press it <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one brief word in support of what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and indeed the noble lord lord campbell of alloway have said <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord moved the amendment i could not help but feel that he was moving what is in effect an unconstitutional amendment <e> <s> he was giving a veto in a matter of public expenditure to someone who was not answerable to parliament <e> <s> with all the good intentions in the world he has contrived an unsuitable form of amendment to achieve what i am sure we all desire proper finance for the purposes of part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words following the speech of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and that of the noble lord on the opposition front bench who i thought brought this discussion into perspective <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor had gone to his colleagues in the government

the right place to raise it i hope that the noble and learned lord will answer the noble lord lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a very brief observation to what the noble lord lord ennals has said <e> <s> i make two points and the first is in relation to clause which says <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she will answer my specific question about treatments within the national health service which are not provided free <e> <s> the noble baroness gave me examples from outside the national health service such as planning permissions <e> <s> i do not see that that has anything to do with what is going on inside <e> <s> if she can provide me with the precedents for charging within the national health service for treatments of this nature i shall be much obliged

be preserved <e> <s> by analogy this bill should follow that line <e>", "<cs> i am very much reassured by what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> it is just that kind of statement that i was eliciting <e> <s> i am very grateful to him and i shall look carefully at what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the fact that the government are to make a statement about the homeless young <e> <s> will they see that the authorities do not prosecute the older people who are sleeping rough under the vagrancy act

national health service were subject to charging <e> <s> we received a peculiar reply and i do not believe that she answered the question <e> <s> she referred us to treatments outside the national health service which none of us believed to be relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has implied that amendments nos <e> <s> to are not apt because they are too particular to be put into the code <e> <s> i respectfully suggest to the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge that what the noble and learned lord said about earlier amendments applies also to this one <e> <s> i should have thought that it might be advisable to have more general guidance in the code but the limit is a matter for the clinician under the code of practice <e> <s> it would be unwise to spell out that limit if only for the reasons adduced by the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris <e> <s> i commend that point of view to the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge <e>", "<cs> my lords

package which incidentally i warmly welcome <e> <s> i refer to the disregard and the loans <e> <s> is it something which can be done without amendment to the bill or will an amendment be required at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord kennet will forgive me <e> <s> the rules about speeches on third reading have been contravened by almost everything that he has said <e> <s> i wish he would confine himelf to reviewing the bill as it has been treated in this house at great length rather than making these points which he might well have made at second reading instead of in a very long speech at third reading <e> <s> it is quite out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords there are at least two things for which i can thank the noble earl <e> <s> they came at the end of his speech <e> <s> first he said that he would consider issuing guidance to those who administer the funds so that they would give special regard to disabled people <e> <s> that was a suggestion that the noble baroness and i put to the noble earl when we met <e> <s> i am very glad that he has accepted it <e> <s> i believe that it will be a help and i hope that he will see that such guidance is issued <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill may already contain the provision <e> <s> no doubt the noble earl can tell us where it is <e> <s> however this is not so material as whether or not the government will make use of the provision <e> <s> that is what we should like to have from the noble earl <e> <s> if he says he will make use of the provision then there would be good reason to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for the support of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and of the noble lord lord hughes <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will understand that it is the feeling of the house that special provision for the disabled should be written into the bill <e> <s> i appeal to him to accept that <e> <s> i very much regret that if he does not i shall have to divide the house <e> <s> it would be most acceptable to the house if the noble earl could nod his head but i can see that he is not doing so and regretfully i ask the house to divide on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly at this stage partly because of the fact that the propriety of proceedings in another place has been questioned <e> <s> first i should say that i entirely agree with the substance of the speech made by my noble friend lord adrian <e> <s> i voted with the majority in the house in the clear conviction that the house had a right to vote as it did <e> <s> however i must unfortunately disagree with the first remarks of my noble friend lord adrian when he blamed the government for disallowing discussion on this subject in the house of commons <e> <s> it had nothing to do with the government <e> <s> it was the speakers decision entirely and the speakers decisions cannot be questioned <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he has reiterated what i have just said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will give way <e> <s> perhaps i can discourage him from proceeding with what appears to be criticism of the speaker of another place <e> <s> i believe that it is highly unwise to do so <e> <s> i should hate to move that anybody should be no longer heard in this house but i should have thought that it was not advisable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express a word of gratitude to the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> i entirely agree that the form of words which the government propose and which are now before the house are an improvement on the form of words which i moved in this house <e> <s> i am grateful to the government for acceding to the amendment and improving on its wording <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the question of the positive voice of the patient is raised at the outset of discussions on the clause <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale that the amendment is too imprecise to prosper <e> <s> subsequent amendments may be more eligible for the governments agreement <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness referred to guidance which is to be issued by the government <e> <s> indeed the main plank of her response to an earlier amendment was that the substance of the amendment should appear in guidance rather than on the face of the bill <e> <s> can she tell the committee in what form the guidance will appear <e> <s> will it be in the form of a code of practice and be generally available for scrutiny <e>", "<cs> i do not seek to press the noble baroness closely on this matter but is what she calls guidance to be issued in the form of a circular <e> <s> that is what i have in mind and if that is what the noble baroness has in mind i know what she is talking about <e> <s> that is all that i am concerned about <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for moving these amendments <e> <s> as he said it should be the noble <e>", "<cs> there is not a great deal that can be said at this stage <e> <s> i re-emphasise that the pilot study stated that the implementation of section of the act would be cost effective <e> <s> that should weigh heavily with the government in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might add a brief word appendant to the coruscating speech of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> when i read the amendment and i was puzzling what it was about it occurred to me that in sum it could be said that lord allen of abbeydale pointed out that the amendment goes beyond the scope of the bill <e> <s> all i ask is whether the noble baroness will advise me which part of the long title covers the clause <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down will she kindly tell the committee what is the power under which organisations may make their representations <e> <s> she has said more than once that organisations can make representations <e> <s> i am wondering under what power in the bill that can be done <e> <s> we are seeking to insert that provision in the bill because we do not find it there <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell me where that provision is to be found <e>", "<cs> i shall be very grateful if the noble baroness can absorb the impact of the discussion that we have had and the import of it outlined from all sides of the committee <e> <s> it is clearly important that organisations should be able to make representations particularly on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves <e> <s> i am delighted to know that the intent of amendment no <e> <s> fc is that not only persons but also organisations shall be able to make representations <e> <s> that does not appear so on the face of the bill <e> <s> some of us know that the word person has a peculiar meaning in the language of the law <e>", "<cs> i think that this matter is worth looking at again <e> <s> it was not our intention to impose an unconditional obligation upon the secretary of state <e> <s> the provision was meant to apply only in a situation where he considered it advisable to set up an inquiry <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will be kind enough to undertake to see that the wording is reviewed to ensure that it reflects the opinion of the chamber <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> on the basis of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am proud to follow the noble lord lord fitt whom i much admire <e> <s> i shall not be so eloquent in following him except to say that i rejoice with him in the outcome of the maguire case <e> <s> i congratulate him on his magnificent persistence which has resulted in that verdict or very near verdict <e>", "<cs> that is very similar my lords but a pertinent and i am sure judicial intervention <e> <s> when he preferred in his jokey way the interest of the victim to the prenatal history of the of fender he reminded me of the high court judge who in the days of corporal punishment used to say that what the violent of fender really needed or wanted was a few strokes of pussy <e> <s> that was the same kind of judicial humour <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for showing himself to us in that way as a museum piece <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak briefly in support of the amendment <e> <s> however i wish first to say a few words to the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton <e> <s> i had the honour to serve on the committee considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i was on my feet and was interrupted by two noble lords <e> <s> i was very happy to give way but i have not finished my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a word to what has been said <e> <s> my initial word is a brief comment on what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> he referred to mr scott in another place as the minister for the disabled <e> <s> he has recently and happily changed his title to the minister for disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl think again about the use of the word lobbying <e> <s> i cannot see that there is any lobbying at all <e> <s> if the noble earl objects to accepting the words proposed by the noble baroness will he perhaps consider writing a letter or putting in so many words outside the bill that signing should be considered by applicants <e> <s> that assurance would greatly help those of us who feel strongly that the wording should be incorporated in the bill but who appreciate the force of his arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure me that one of the reasons why the government appear to be dragging their feet is not because they do not agree with article which deals with the protection of the child from all forms of physical or mental violence <e> <s> i hope that that is not the case and that the noble lord can give me that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the present prime minister is the first person to hold that office who has also held the office of minister for the disabled as it was then or minister for disabled people as it is now <e> <s> organisations for the disabled therefore greatly hope that the government will be more sympathetic than they have perhaps been in the past about representations from them especially in regard to the poll tax <e> <s> will she kindly say whether representations in regard to the poll tax should be made to the secretary of state for the environment or to the minister for disabled people <e>"]
