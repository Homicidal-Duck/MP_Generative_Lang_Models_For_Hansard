["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that non-committal reply <e> <s> i hope he is not put off by the fact that the tories were virtually excluded from office for nearly a hundred years after the glorious revolution <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount whether he does not agree that the significance of the year is that the modern parliamentary system dates from the glorious revolution whereby the government depend upon a majority in the house of commons for their existence and is this not worthy of celebration <e> <s> further is it not worthy of celebration that we have had peaceful changes in administration for nearly years <e> <s> would it not be particularly suitable to celebrate that fact in what might well be an election year <e>"]
