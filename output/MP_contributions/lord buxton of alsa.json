["<cs> my lords for the record may i remind the noble lord lord tanlaw that i did not suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ritchie-calder both for giving us the opportunity to debate this vital subject and also for the broad sketch he gave us of the current situation affecting the antarctic treaty <e> <s> i hope my views are not regarded by some as excessively conservation-minded or unfashionable but if that is so it is because through my experience in television in this country and around the world i believe that governments are tending to lag behind public opinion where conservation of wild paradises and wildlife are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply which is not dissimilar from the reply which he gave to the debate on this subject which i introduced last year may i ask my noble friend and the government whether they are aware as they must be that something critical has happened since that similar statement was made that is the invasion of afghanistan <e> <s> are they aware of their own policy and their own reaction and the effect it is having on the world and do the government now understand that they are marching in opposite directions on the one hand on policy and on the other hand on finance and i am purposely not referring to the domestic economy or any issue of that sort where overseas matters of a comparatively fringe nature are concerned <e> <s> may i ask the government now to update <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i have to ask my noble friend whether he recalls that the prime minister has called for more broadcasts to russia and for considerable expansion and with your lordships approval i ask him to respond about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that at this time russia is installing new -kilowatt shortwave transmitters that the voice of america and west germany have numerous shortwave transmitters under construction and that many other countries the netherlands norway yugoslavia iraq india nigeria and south africa are all marching forward with expansionist programmes on shortwave transmitters and only britain is either static or going backwards <e> <s> will the government please give urgent attention to the fact that we are losing our way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that answer may i put one very important question to him <e> <s> bearing in mind that the lack of initiative and enterprise in the falkland islands except for sheep farming derives from uncertainty and indecisiveness by successive governments throughout the century will this government now extend the fishing limits to miles round the falkland islands and dependencies <e> <s> in my view that would be in the best interests both of britain and of argentina the more so because those waters are being heavily exploited and over-fished by eastern bloc fleets including russians and poles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness for her reply and for outlining the current situation <e> <s> however are the government aware that other nations both east and west are massively increasing their expenditure and their activities in the antarctic and that therefore there is now a real danger that britain will lose its traditional influence and position in the antarctic <e> <s> is she further aware that if it is cut the amounts are so marginal in such a marginal budget that this could have serious results for britains interests in the future which are not only scientific but also strategic and considerably political <e>", "<cs> i wish to declare an interest as a director of anglia television <e> <s> i should like to throw a little light if i may on the purely practical nature of the effect of the amendment <e> <s> if the contract is for eight years it is very important to bear in mind what happens during those eight years <e> <s> i should like to start at the back year eight <e> <s> if the iba awarded a contract to a new applicant and deposed the incumbent then the year eight of the eight years that we are talking about could well be a sort of completely dead period so far as the programme service is concerned <e> <s> i am not saying that the service would not go on but a deposed contractor would not be full of tremendous zest or zeal in producing a programme service during the eighth year <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the two noble earls for their splendid maiden speeches which filled me with envy when i recalled my <e>", "<cs> may i take one point which has not been mentioned <e> <s> i should dearly love to hold forth for half an hour about wildfowling at night but i will concentrate on the aspect that has not been mentioned <e> <s> the rspb the nature conservancy and so forth have no more ardent supporter than myself <e> <s> for a number of years i have also been a vice-president of the wildfowlers association <e> <s> i therefore hope to give you an entirely objective view <e> <s> the damage and disturbance done is obviously not understood by the noble lords who moved these amendments <e> <s> the damage is absolutely minimal as has been mentioned before because the right opportunities are so rare and the people involved say one of these intrepid young wildfowlers only perhaps get one good evening a year perhaps not that <e>", "<cs> may i just say that there is no known species on this planet that courts at night in degrees of frost in january <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to be very brief and to raise only one point which has not yet been mentioned <e> <s> in thanking and congratulating my noble friend lord cranbrook and his committee for this very valuable and thorough report i should like to add that i imply absolutely no criticism of him or of his committee in drawing attention to what i believe to be a very remarkable omission <e> <s> but of course his committee was reporting on the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might speak on this although i was not intending to since i am going to move amendment no <e> <s> a in the names of my noble friend lord craigton myself and others <e> <s> but since the two are being taken together perhaps it might help if i were to say a few words now <e> <s> i shall be very concise but i want to say straight away that i am not going to be hurried <e> <s> i am not going to have it said by my grandchildren and descendants or by anyone elses that i could not press the case for wildlife conservation because of the timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am moving amendment no <e> <s> a so <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is proper for the government to spend nearly million in the form of a grant towards this scheme of which i feel sure the public disapprove when the government at present quite rightly are unable to spend similar sums on a great many things that the public want <e> <s> secondly does he agree that in reality the area will be excessively drained solely in order to secure this grant of nearly million because it has to be an improvement and therefore as the minister said there will be the question of bigger and better pumps whereas if they are simply replaced in order to maintain the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the drainage to which my noble friend lord onslow referred has caused pollution but was totally unknown and unpredicted by those involved <e> <s> would he therefore agree that in order to avoid a similar mistake being made again it is essential to have a public inquiry before the new scheme affecting the halvergate marshes <e>", "<cs> my lords i need not keep your lordships more than a couple of moments because i have spoken at great length of this subject previously <e> <s> as chairman of itn i find it rather bizarre but not unacceptable to be described as a tom-tom beater for the bbcs external services <e> <s> however i must tell my noble friend lord carrington that i have been beating it for over two years and have not been in the least bit influenced by the information which has been very helpfully served out to everybody recently because i have not yet read it <e>", "<cs> my lords my reasons for pressing this amendment moved by the noble earl lord onslow are not really based on conservation grounds at all they are because of this one word <e> <s> i firmly believe after more than years in this field of activity that it will turn out to be bad legislation <e> <s> it will not work everybody will be confused and it will lead to needless and serious ill-feeling and strife <e> <s> either the government must confirm that the money will be available and it could be millions a year or if they say that the money will not be available then frankly this part of the bill is a fraud <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think it is necessary to do so <e> <s> i did not say anything about that <e> <s> i said that it was the duty of the managements of the agricultural farming companies to maximise revenue and that if there is money sitting there the manager should be sacked if he does not go for it <e> <s> this clause as it now stands not only invites farmers and landowners who have no intention to plough or drain scientific sites it obliges them according to business practice <e> <s> it is not as my noble friend lord onslow said his legal responsibility to do so but it is his business responsibility to do so according to normal practice to go through this process to finish up with compensation and therefore additional revenue <e> <s> even where the financial institutions are not involved and it is a family farm it will still be a company and it seems obvious that a conservation-minded farmer owning wetland and or moorland with scientific interest will feel obliged to go for the additional revenue <e> <s> either his son or the partner will say you must be out of your mind if you do not realise what you can do <e> <s> it is naive to say that there will be just a few isolated cases and that most will get settled out of court or as they are today at a tea party <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for what he said <e> <s> every time he speaks his words give a great deal of assurance <e> <s> what worries me is that i still do not see us any nearer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord morris for introducing this debate which is both timely and of extreme importance <e> <s> may i first apologise to your lordships that i have to leave i fear before the end of the debate owing to a very long-standing commitment which i cannot opt out of but i shall of course read what is said after my departure with the greatest of interest tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords before putting my question i would mention that i have been in the argentine the falkland islands and south georgia within the last two weeks <e> <s> that being so i would say that in my view the reaction of the government has been absolutely right and correct in the circumstances taking into account that our two countries our two governments are in continuous respectable and honourable diplomatic relations and the interruption to those by the reckless conduct of naval elements particularly in south georgia is much to be deplored <e>", "<cs> i know personally some of the argentinians my lords so may i appeal through my noble friend to them to take due regard of argentinas future prestige and reputation in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak only very briefly on two points <e> <s> first having been in argentina south georgia and the falkland islands in the past month i would like to say that i myself can attach no blame to the government for not anticipating or expecting this massive invasion on such a huge scale <e> <s> i have to concede and admit that i did not expect it <e> <s> i had a long private talk in buenos aires with the foreign minister dr costa mendez and i did not have a clue about the invasion although i did pass on that i thought casual landings such as that which occurred in south georgia were quite possible <e> <s> certainly the falkland islanders did not expect it <e> <s> the reason why nobody expected it i believe was that we are after all in the midst of honourable diplomatic negotiations with argentina and that the last session only took place in february <e> <s> this has clearly been planned and must have been plotted for a very long time <e> <s> how could we expect any mature nation that cares about its inter national prestige to perpetrate such an action at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to bring your lordships back to the subject of this debate and the important matter which confronts us i wish to refer very briefly to a subject which was raised by the noble lord lord kennet the sudden emergence on the scene of the russians a matter which has been referred to in the media today as russia seeing a bit of mileage out of embarrassing britain <e> <s> having been very recently in the antarctic the falklands and so on i feel that i should put the matter in its proper context <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend briefly whether the government will now remove entirely south georgia and the dependencies from the agenda of any further diplomatic negotiations since argentina has never in all history had any basis whatever for having anything to do with those territories <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to speak for long because i have said so much on this subject before but i should like to say endorsing what the noble lord lord chalfont has said that i never believed that there was any chance of a settlement by diplomatic negotiations <e> <s> i feel that the handling of the diplomacy and the brilliant organisation and the movement of the task force has been absolutely faultless and the government were right do it and to pursue it with painstaking care and patience <e> <s> nevertheless i never believed there was any hope of a settlement <e> <s> how could there be <e> <s> the noble lord lord aylestone has already pointed out that any military dictator who surrenders his prime objective is really preparing his own bunker or scaffold <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to be very brief about the question on the future defence of the falkland islands <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly add my tribute to the task force and its brilliant organisation which many noble lords have mentioned today none more eloquently than the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> but since i was down there in february and march in south georgia the falklands and the antarctic perhaps i may especially pay tribute to the amazing rugged capability of the individual british serviceman in all three services his extraordinary fitness and stamina and above all his amazing adaptability <e> <s> in the last war we saw how people from all over the country whether they were bank clerks farm workers or factory workers proved their ascendency in the burmese jungle in deserts mountains and elsewhere <e> <s> now for i believe the first time this century they have proved that they are best in sub-antarctic conditions at the worst time of the year <e> <s> i think that it is a remarkable thing on the part of the individual and that is what makes me very proud about the achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lady vickers for her persistence in bringing back this bill <e> <s> it may be more helpful as the merits of the bill have been spoken about by many of your lordships if i refer to some of the wider issues which strike me because of my tolerable familiarity with that part of the world <e> <s> the importance of the governments response is no longer in my view related only to the merits of the bill because what has become the paramount issue is what we might call the argentine interpretation factor and also the latin american and united nations interpretation factor <e> <s> we are being watched in south america and in the united nations to see whether britain means what it said and did <e> <s> we are being <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise to my noble friend the leader of the house to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and to your lordships that unfortunately i have to leave soon owing to an inescapable longstanding engagement for which i am now already overdue <e> <s> i will therefore cut what i had to say to absolute ribbons and will make only one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very brieflly on an aspect which has not been mentioned so far but first may i congratulate the noble lord lord stoddart on his maiden speech and add my warm support to the tribute paid by my noble friend lord soames <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend lord kimberley begins his speech could i say that i apologise for being out of the chamber for a couple of minutes when i believe the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and my noble friend lord home of the hirsel explained their position when they were foreign secretary <e> <s> whatever they said <e> <s> i absolutely accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally it is tempting to make a large number of points resulting from this excellent debate but in view of the wide range of authority and experience of all the speakers i feel that it would be both presumptuous and tedious to extend the debate <e> <s> may i express my appreciation of the months of arduous work carried out by sir rex hunt and his staff by major-general thorne and general spacey and by the services in the falkland islands <e> <s> we should like them to know that we think they have done a marvellous job <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend the minister because i am sure the people of st helena will be enormously comforted and strengthened by the news that next year they are to have an official visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord ashbourne on his maiden speech to which i listened with considerable envy and mortification when i recall the dreadful delivery of my own maiden speech <e> <s> i shall speak very briefly on one point which has not yet been mentioned except being very briefly touched upon by the noble lord lord mishcon who seemed to indicate that he was disposed to have this matter considered further <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it might be helpful if following the noble lord lord jenkins i spoke to my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> which although similar is not as he says identical <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord jenkins for offering to support me <e> <s> but i am not wholly dissatisfied with my noble friends reply <e> <s> i feel a sense of frustration because we are so close that frankly i cannot understand what the difficulty is all about <e> <s> we are talking about classification <e> <s> that is not like learning to become a physicist a biologist or even <e>", "<cs> i was interested in that point which the noble lord lord mishcon made before <e> <s> of course i will give every encouragement that i can to both the iba and the bbc if they choose to listen <e> <s> i think the reason the authorities have not been bombarding noble lords with lobbying material is that they are in some difficulty as they meet regularly with the home office which is their superior department or whatever is the correct expression <e> <s> the companies and certainly itn are not in that position and have no hesitation in coming straight to members of both houses of parliament <e> <s> possibly there is in the authorities an inhibition to lobbying publicly about their case in the same way <e> <s> if a document is required i am sure that by now they will almost be working on it if they have representatives in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> on the understanding that i shall not leave my noble friends room until he has agreed i shall not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the noble lord lord howard i should like to assure your lordships that i do not intend to speak at length because i have done so twice on two previous occasions when moving this amendment and everything that i have to say is already on the record <e> <s> therefore it would be wearisome for me to extend the debate <e> <s> however i should like to add just one vital point to what i have said before <e> <s> i understand that there are advantages and benefits in this bill going through in the form of a private members bill because of the advantages of the time-scale and the urgency of dealing with the video nasties which concern us all <e>", "<cs> my lords with the consent of my noble friend the minister i am following the noble lord lord howard because my name should in fact be on the amendment <e> <s> it was on the single sheet yesterday but i have somehow disappeared without trace in the marshalled list <e> <s> i should also declare an interest as chairman of itn and a director of anglia television <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord shackleton very much for initiating this debate <e> <s> he and i have long been associated together and indeed we have a friendship brought about by these matters <e> <s> we have been to the falklands together <e> <s> i am very glad that he is going to wind up the debate and no doubt he will round off many of the points that some of us are making <e>", "<cs> my lords may i clarify to the noble lord although i do not think it is necessary for anybody else that i never said anything about a conflagration in the south atlantic <e> <s> i was saying that in the event of a conflagration in the northern hemisphere where it is most likely to be it is then vital to have safe and secure maritime communications in the south <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the government understand that the conservation of wildlife is a very vital economic and social issue and not just a scientific and aesthetic one <e> <s> is it appreciated that if the present operations continue the wildlife that will attract and provide the potential for tourism the penguins the sealions the fur seals and so on will all starve to death and be unable to feed their young and there will then be no potential at all for tourism <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and to the noble baronesses lady white and lady nicol <e> <s> it has been a very rewarding and helpful exchange of views <e> <s> i am even grateful to the two noble lords who expressed reservations because that is characteristic of the balanced nature of all our discussions <e>", "<cs> i had intended to move amendment no <e> <s> which relates to charges by adas but if i speak now i shall not have to introduce that amendment <e> <s> i had intended to say a great deal about adas and the subject of charges but almost all of it has been said <e> <s> i should like to underline the fact that i feel deeply and am as worried as anybody about the prospects for adas and the dangers implications and consequences that may arise from the proposed charges for advice <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest <e> <s> i regard the attitude of several noble lords as being negative and lacking in enterprise <e> <s> i hope my noble friend the minister will forgive me once again for not being my usual very amiable friendly self <e>", "<cs> one last word <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend the minister that consultants probably are fairly well informed but i have in mind also the increasing number of representatives especially manufacturers sales representatives and so on <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for his offer to think about the amendment <e> <s> in view of that generous response which was certainly well worth waiting the entire day for i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was able to agree with almost everything my noble friend the minister said except his argument against particularly <e> <s> i see entirely all the <e>", "<cs> i have a lot to learn from my noble friend lord belstead because he made the case for my amendment far better and more eloquently than i did at the start <e> <s> i am very grateful for that because it will add weight in <e>", "<cs> i did not realise what a hornets nest we were putting our foot into <e> <s> we seem to have flushed out an enormous constitutional issue which i find absolutely fascinating <e>", "<cs> on the basis of what i said previously and in anticipation of returning to this subject i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for that reply <e> <s> i fully understand the arguments which my noble friend has put forward <e> <s> however i have one slight apprehension <e> <s> i entirely agree with his notion of flexibility in order to make sure that nobody feels that he is being railroaded or overruled <e> <s> i hope he will keep in mind that there is a danger that once he is seen to be too flexible in one case the buzz will get around that one does not really have to agree with this and that if one kicks up enough fuss they will either go away or change it <e> <s> there is that slight danger in not having a fairly firm approach to the matter <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful for all that my noble friend has said and for all that he has in mind <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord annan for kindly giving us this opportunity to debate the peacock report <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of blackburn on his marvellous contribution this afternoon <e> <s> i have to declare interests which are one reason why i have never spoken on broadcasting in your lordships house except to fight on many occasions for the maintenance of the bbc external services <e> <s> i hope that i was helpful in ensuring the survival of the world service of the bbc which is universally popular <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord torrington for introducing this unstarred question and giving us the chance to make brief observations on the draft directive <e> <s> i am happy on this occasion to be able to congratulate the government <e> <s> so often one finds that on a subject about which one is deeply concerned one is not supporting the government of which i am a backbencher <e> <s> however on this occasion they are doing very well in dealing with the problem of the draft directive and the quotas <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord bonham-carter forgive me if i respond by saying that i said nothing against independent producers or their productions getting on to the services <e> <s> i am simply against quotas being fixed by government <e> <s> i think it should be left to bodies like the bbc and the iba to settle <e>", "<cs> my lords the offending word is quotas <e> <s> arrangements can be made by the services

wording of the motion because it enables me to deal with a specific case for special measures <e> <s> that is the subject of afforestation in the far north that is the wild wilderness in sutherland and caithness known as the flow country <e> <s> before anyone thinks that i am against forestry or afforestation let me say that i regard this particular case as a specific political social and environmental problem <e> <s> i am entirely in favour of forestry and indulge in it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by welcoming the bill and saying that i fully support it <e> <s> i make that clear because like the noble baroness and the noble lord lord hunt i wish to press strongly one main point <e> <s> that should not be taken to imply that i do not welcome the bill <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend the minister who i know has put in painstaking and patient hours over months of work in order to bring us to where we are today <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister forgive me <e> <s> i wish to say in the warmest terms to my noble friend lord ferrers that he missed the distinction i was drawing between conservation of the environment for the benefit of tourists boaters sailors water skiers and others and the protection of wildlife which is on a level with tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord carter for giving us the opportunity to discuss such an important subject <e> <s> like him i shall not dwell this afternoon on the subject of the flow country <e> <s> however while i have the opportunity i should like to say that i am per cent <e> <s> in favour of forestry <e> <s> last year i planted three new broadleaved woods and i shall be doing more <e> <s> it is outrageous that people like myself and the nature conservancy council and any others who are deeply concerned about the destruction of one of europes ecological gems should be vilified and thought to be anti-forestry <e> <s> it is a ludicrous suggestion and i should like to leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not extend the debate but i wish to say that i was referring only to the flow country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for giving us this opportunity to express views at this juncture in the existence of broadcasting <e> <s> i ought to express a somewhat muted vested interest being a shareholder last month having retired as chairman of anglia television after years in the industry during some of them as chairman of itn <e> <s> since the noble lord lord annan gave such a brilliant account and review of matters over the recent decade or so i should like very briefly to speak of things as they are from the inside <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer which i find somewhat reassuring although i am not sure what currently means <e> <s> do all government departments appreciate that whether we like it or not and a good many of us do not broadcasting and in particular television have become part of the life-blood of the nation and almost like air and water <e> <s> do the government understand that tossing ideas around about public service broadcasting which have grave implications social and political for the future is not a very encouraging sign particularly as it gives the impression that the government treat public service broadcasting as if it were analogous to the manufacture of electronics or the expansion of supermarkets <e>", "<cs> my lords why do we have to wait for the research <e> <s> as i understand it we are years behind the united states which already has stringent regulations <e> <s> they must presumably have been introduced as a result of research <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in this matter as a small shareholder in anglia television <e> <s> my reason for speaking today is that i with colleagues founded anglia television in <e> <s> i served as an executive for years and retired as chairman earlier this year <e> <s> during that period i was also chairman of itn and of itv companies association <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to that <e> <s> i believe that ministers may have been misled into thinking that the staff will be taken over as they always have been in the past because a local television station as everybody knows is an essential and vital component of the local news and programmes <e> <s> however the white paper goes on to say that it is not necessary to have local studios and that is one flaw in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening <e> <s> did i understand the noble lord to say that my noble friend lord ferrers had stated that the highest bid did not have to be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the white paper says that the highest bid will stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he ensure also that the government take into account the prestige value of having a british ship supplied to the british antarctic survey which is pre-eminent internationally in antarctic affairs <e> <s> does he accept that it could be slightly embarrassing for the british antarctic survey not to be supplied with a british vessel <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords have already spoken on a wide range of issues and others will follow <e> <s> with a reputation as a conservationist and as one who has been to the antarctic i believe that it would be wrong for a debate to take place without sufficient reference being made to the very strong feelings of conservationists led especially by my lifelong friend sir peter scott <e> <s> i have no doubt that the conservationists would have the support of the vast majority of the public if the issue was put to them <e> <s> i should like to reassure my noble friend lord glenarthur that i support the bill i believe it expedient that it should be introduced <e> <s> nevertheless it would be unfair to disregard what is so widely felt by so many people <e>", "<cs> my lords before making two brief points i must declare an interest as a small shareholder in anglia television <e> <s> i helped to found it more than years ago and i retired two years ago <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to deal with the international aspect which is almost invariably ignored <e> <s> we have nothing but inward-looking domestic debates on this whole issue <e>

although i live in england and am english i find that i know far more about the flow country than do most scotsmen <e> <s> it is utterly ridiculous for the noble lord lord taylor to imply that only englishmen can understand conservation in england <e> <s> the reason i resigned from the nature conservancy council was that it was embarrassing to hear scotsmen implying that only scotsmen know about conservation in scotland <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to follow the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> i point out that only recently there was a great scare about marine shellfish prawns and so on in an area which stretched up the east coast from the middle of england to the middle of scotland <e> <s> the question of the noble lord lord shackleton is important <e> <s>

the minister <e> <s> the history of the matter occurred happily before the issue fell into his lap <e>", "<cs> may i add a few brief words in support of amendment no <e> <s> and the word documentaries <e> <s> i hope that i can persuade my noble friend lord ferrers to give the amendment his most careful consideration <e> <s> what i have to say is based on personal experience and fact <e>", "<cs> i think i gave the answer that the iba had the power the muscle and the authority to force the programme on and to keep it on <e> <s> my noble friend is right to recall that i believe about years ago the world was stunned when survival beat top of the pops and that was in the days when we had only two channels <e> <s> with my accustomed modesty i remember saying at the time that it only proved that over half the population would rather watch anything than top of the pops <e>", "<cs> my lords since the future of nature conservancy is clearly a non-party matter of great national concern perhaps i may ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> is she aware that everybody in the country concerned with the issue knows that the additional costs of maintaining the service on a three body
