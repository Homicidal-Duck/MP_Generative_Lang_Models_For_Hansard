["<cs> my lords it is a great honour for me to have the duty as leader of the house of following the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord byers in congratulating the mover and seconder on their fine speeches <e> <s> i should also like to say that it is a great personal pleasure as well as a political pleasure to follow the noble lord lord peart on these benches <e> <s> as i believe was pointed out by a well-known commentator on the air the other day when the history of these times is written the noble lord will find himself more closely associated with my party than he may think today since he shares a particular distinction with one of the greatest tories <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the two noble lords who have spoken will forgive me if i do not follow them in everything they have said but i should like to take up a couple of points <e> <s> the noble lord lord peart referred with some vehemence i thought to the neb the activities of which as he rightly said we wish to restrict <e> <s> how far the government will decide to restrict those activities it is too early to tell <e> <s> however i wish to put it to him that the reason we wish to restrict those activities is that we would not wish to see an increase of nationalisation either by the front door or indeed by the back door of the neb <e>", "<cs> my lords the rules for the conduct of short wednesday debates which are set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble lord lord hale was called for the next

hope that your lordships will agree to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend answered that it was a loaded question <e> <s> i think that the government at least and perhaps the house as well would benefit if we moved on to take some advice on some other subjects <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising these points when i was in the chamber <e> <s> there is not a totally simple situation here <e> <s> there was a companies bill which the party opposite introduced previously but we have chosen to take as it were two bites at the cherry <e> <s> it would not be right with respect to say that the bill will be coming in a few weeks <e> <s> this is not going to be in the session that ends in november it will be in the session so it will not be here for some while <e> <s> as i see it the opposition must of course make up their minds on this and many people will judge from what they say and how they choose to do it <e> <s> but they are open within the rules and orders of the house to do as they deem fit <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords time moves on and perhaps we should proceed to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a very long run at this question <e> <s> i propose that we move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that is a question for me rather than for my noble friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> i would say that it is a question which might perhaps have been more felicitously put <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this house of parliament might agree that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter in the first place for the administration committee <e> <s> the committee last considered the provision of a bar for peers and lobby correspondents as recently as march last year <e> <s> they concluded that it was not a practical proposition because of the lack of accommodation and the cost involved <e> <s> the committee suggested that journalists and peers might be encouraged to use the lords bar <e> <s> peers may of course invite journalists to the guest room as their guests <e>",

was announced to the house yesterday by my noble friend lord denham <e> <s> in moving it today i feel that i should state again the circumstances which make it necessary <e> <s> on tuesday the joint committee on statutory instruments drew attention to an error of one day in a date on the order <e> <s> they recommended <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard that supplementary question i think that it would be a good idea if we moved on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords before we get on to the next question as my noble friend lord campbell of croy wished a happy birthday to my <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it might be of interest to the house if i told noble lords that in order for the leadership to better serve the best interests of the house i have invited my noble friend lord ferrers to be deputy leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the statement made by my noble friend and the questions put to him by a number of your lordships it may be for the convenience of the house if i make a statement on the governments intentions regarding the bill on southern rhodesia which is being introduced in another place this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and for the convenience of the house i should like to make a statement on the business for next week <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord lord wade for interrupting his debate and also to the noble lord lord ohagan who is to speak next <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that in view of the suggestion made by the noble lord lord avebury with which i think we all agree perhaps further questions should wait until the statement is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot yet say when the review body will report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps after that singularly appropriate supplementary we might move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it should be agreed by the house that at this time even we cannot live by bread alone <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords you are all most kind but i must say i cannot allow too much of this <e> <s> you are all out of order every one of you <e> <s> i suppose that every moment i should have risen to my feet as leader of the house and suggested that the noble lord should be no longer heard but in view of the nice things he was saying about me i did not feel quite able to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a lot of business to get through today <e> <s> perhaps we should move on <e>", "<cs> my lords just before my noble friend answers i feel i must suggest to noble lords that

now that my noble friend has given such a demonstration of his detailed knowledge of his job and we know that the dishwashing machine was found to be at the end of its tether i wonder whether we in this house are not approaching the same sort of situation and whether we should not move on to other business <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not issue guidelines in the way the noble lord suggests <e> <s> how the review body carries out its work is a matter for that body itself <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on th may there were legislative draftsmen working full-time in the parliamentary counsel office including those engaged on consolidation bills and those seconded to the law commission <e> <s> the corresponding numbers for th may and th may were full-time and two

the house will agree that we ought to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think noble lords will agree that we should now move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that probably the whole house has been enjoying this exchange and the cut and thrust between men of law almost as much as my right honourable noble and learned friend has himself enjoyed it but i think that we should not leave it all to them <e> <s> perhaps we should pass on <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister on the venice economic summit <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords there are the usual four starred questions on the order paper <e> <s> i suggest that perhaps we ought to move on to the second one <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement which is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the house wishes to have a debate this can be discussed through the usual channels <e> <s> it may well be that this would be the wish of the house and the usual channels would be at the disposal of the house <e> <s> we have now had up to minutes on this statement and supplementaries we have quite a lot of business in front of us and i suggest we move on <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that we have spent minutes on this question i suggest that we move on i am very sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if there is a broad measure of agreement in the house perhaps we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords late yesterday evening while the house was sitting a wooden ornamental boss in the ceiling of the chamber fell to the floor <e> <s> no one was hurt but had the boss hit anyone death or serious injury could have been caused <e> <s> on investigation the boss was found to have been held in position by little more than a tight fit reinforced by glue <e> <s> there are about such bosses in the chamber ceiling dating from the mid-nineteenth century all of which must clearly now be inspected in the interests of your lordships and made good in the interests of safety <e> <s> this work could take three or four days <e>", "<cs> my lords in my statement last tuesday about the state of the ceiling of the parliament chamber i said that the property services agency hoped to have any defects made good in time to have the parliament chamber back in use for next mondays sitting <e> <s> the ceiling has since been inspected by a number of experts including timber specialists from the building research establishment <e> <s> i regret to have to inform your lordships that their interim report is to the effect that the problem is more extensive than first appeared in that much of the ornamental woodwork in the ceiling is in a weakened condition <e> <s> it has apparently become very dried out and brittle <e> <s> the psa have therefore had to conclude that subject to further study a major works programme to make good and restore the ceiling may well be necessary before it can be considered as safe and sound <e> <s> this work could clearly take some time and must of course first be carefully planned <e>", "<cs> my lords the special session should adopt an international development strategy <e> <s> preparatory work on this is far advanced <e> <s> the global negotiations should also be launched at the same session <e> <s> we hope that it will be possible on the basis of the work already done to agree an agenda and procedures <e> <s> we have participated constructively in the preparations for both items and look forward to positive results on both <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since i am being goaded by noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords no general aid fund for zimbabwe has been established <e> <s> we have been active in urging all friendly donors to provide generous aid for zimbabwe and will continue so to do <e> <s> the results so far have been somewhat disappointing <e> <s> however some donors have made only initial pledges for immediate reconstruction and others have yet to make known their intentions <e> <s> in addition to bilateral pledges a number of international agencies will be starting programmes in zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good run on this question and perhaps it is important in the interests of the house that questions do not turn into a matter of debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn and in so doing i hope your lordships will not take it amiss if i wish all members of the house a pleasant and as i think we all feel a well-deserved recess <e> <s> sitting here in the royal gallery over the last three weeks has not been at all easy for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great sadness that i rise as leader of your lordships house to pay tribute to the noble and learned viscount lord dilhorne whose death during

house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will forgive me but i think questions and answers after a statement should not go too far into the subject matter <e> <s> i hope noble lords will keep their questjons as brief as possible <e> <s> a very good example was set by the noble lord lord boston <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper

repeated in your lordships house later on the same day the fact that junior ministers in the house of lords receive no salary in respect of their parliamentary duties is a very real problem <e> <s> the government are still considering what steps might be taken to resolve this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant duty to respond to the motion proposed by the noble lord lord peart and supported by the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> nearly months have passed since in this house we last enjoyed the great ceremony of the state opening of parliament <e> <s> during that period not i must confess a period of constant tranquillity exactly for your lordships house i have been privileged to learn through the white heat of events some of the very special duties and responsibilities which the leader of this chamber must carry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords after two full days debate in this house it is now my pleasant duty to open the debate on economic affairs and looking at the list of your lordships who are intending to take part in this debate and particularly looking forward to the maiden speeches by the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln and the noble lord lord weinstock i think we can all look forward to as interesting and stimulating a debate as we could have upon this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would ask his question <e> <s> then my noble friend would be delighted to answer it <e> <s> his supplementary is i think the noble lord will agree a little long <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not recommend that <e> <s> as i announced in a written answer on th november the change to the new a size took place at the beginning of this session in accordance with a decision of the house on st december following a recommendation from the offices committee <e> <s> a similar change has been agreed for copies of the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords although i see the point of my noble friend lord derwent i think perhaps we should impose upon ourselves a self-denying ordinance <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that as we have been minutes on two questions we might move on <e>", "<cs> my lords most government departments have their own training arrangements to help meet the need to equip their staff to do their jobs well <e> <s> there are nine residential establishments including the civil service college at sunningdale which provide courses for staff from all departments <e> <s> both residential and non-residential training are financed by the departments concerned <e> <s> the residential establishments provide board and lodging free of charge to students who do not therefore receive separate subsistence payments but may claim a residential course allowance of per day to reimburse incidental expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will permit me to delay for a few more moments the beginning of what i am sure will be a well-informed and interesting committee stage <e> <s> but i think it is right that as leader of the house i should draw attention to the quite exceptional number of amendments in fact i believe in recent years an unprecedented number which appear on the marshalled list today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will agree that it is time we moved on <e>", "<cs> my lords papers of the nature described by my noble friend would not normally fall within the long-standing convention that ministers do not see any papers indicating the views of their predecessors of a different party <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will agree that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i informed the house during the debate on the second reading of my noble friends constitutional referendum bill in december last that the government would consider whether measures should be taken to protect the existence of the second chamber <e> <s> this they are doing but no conclusion has yet been reached

this subject <e> <s> in view of the fact that there is another meeting which has been announced to take place on wednesday i think the house will agree it is better to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords

manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it my duty as leader of the house to inform your lordships that i shall shortly be leaving for a trip this time to zimbabwe not southern rhodesia <e> <s> i shall be away for about a week for the international aid

speech on the situation so much as perhaps to give within the form <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a further statement about the civil service dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my sad duty as leader of the house to pay a brief tribute to lord rea who died last week at the age of <e> <s> he was a member of a leading liberal family and succeeded to the peerage in <e> <s> within only two years he had become chief whip of the liberal party and from to he was the liberal party leader in this house <e> <s> also from to a period of years he was a much-valued member of the deputy chairmens panel <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should move on to the next question <e> <s> we have already had a number of supplementaries on this question <e>",

april <e> <s> at that meeting i repeated yet again that the cash limit which the government have set for was final and i reminded them that million others who work in the public services had already accepted that fact <e> <s> for the future i told them that the government would be ready to set up an independent inquiry to advise us on fresh arrangements for determining civil service pay <e> <s> i also told them that for next year we would be ready to enter into genuine negotiations without a predetermined cash limit <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> since the debate in your lordships house last december the government have carefully considered the matter to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> the government are entirely committed to a second chamber as an essential part of the constitution

pay dispute broke down on friday <e> <s> the talks had been concerned both with future arrangements for determining civil service pay and this years increase in response to the unions anxiety about arrangements for settling civil service pay in the future <e> <s> i told them that we were ready to set up an independent outside inquiry to advise on the best up-to-date arrangements <e> <s> furthermore since this was unlikely to report in time for the pay settlement the government would not set their cash limit for civil service pay next year in advance of negotiations with the unions <e> <s> but the government were not prepared to agree to the unions further demand that they should be guaranteed access to arbitration for should agreement not be reached in negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first of the two motions standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> i think perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house if i were to speak to both motions

my lords what is more i do not think that the house could improve on the answer so i suggest that we move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords this was a long statement which my noble friend repeated on a very important subject <e> <s> i felt that the house wanted to run on rather longer than usual in asking supplementary questions but i have the feeling that it would be the wish of the
