["<cs> my lords i welcome the governments white paper which on the whole i regard as a well-argued and well-balanced document <e> <s> i must confess to some continuing misgivings over the arrangements for donors because i think the problems of anonymity and deception involved in this issue have not yet been fully resolved <e> <s> i agree with the main proposals put forward in the white paper and in particular with the establishment of the statutory licensing authority and what is said about the scope of its work <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i cannot draw on such a history but i believe i owe it to the committee to explain why i feel that i must vote against the clause <e> <s> i must apologise that i have not hitherto been able to take part in any of the debates <e> <s> i have other things to do but i have read very carefully not only the second reading debate but also the whole of the debate on the bill introduced by the noble earl lord halsbury in december <e> <s> i was fascinated when reading the debate to see that i was constantly being referred to in my absence as having written to the noble earl to say that i disliked centralism and i therefore would not support his bill <e> <s> so i beg leave to explain my objections and my belief that this clause is the wrong way to deal with what i recognise is a very serious problem but that legislation of this kind is far too blunt an instrument <e> <s> in saying that i echo what the minister said in winding up the debate on the bill introduced by the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up the point about teaching in schools and quote from the statement of the minister during the debate on the bill of the noble earl lord halsbury months ago <e> <s> he asked why there should be a bill of this kind in schools and he added <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a little alarmed at the high expectations expressed by the minister about what i am going to say <e> <s> i hope that he will not be too disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what the two noble lords who have preceded me have said your lordships will realise that i stand before them with a somewhat ambiguous reputation in these matters <e> <s> however i am sure noble lords will know how to make up their own minds <e> <s> i too wish to start by paying tribute to the magisterial introductory speech by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor which covered the ground so well that there seems little left to be said <e> <s> however i am sure that that will not deter us from debating the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little alarmed to find myself in such a prominent position on the list of speakers in this debate as my intention is to concentrate on only one small part of the report <e> <s> i shall start by congratulating the noble and gallant lord lord carver and his committee on an excellent and timely piece of work <e> <s> i also wish to congratulate him on his lucid handling in his speech of this complex subject <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble duke for his opening speech which i think helped to clarify the grounds of his opposition to research although i must confess that i found his clarification somewhat odd <e> <s> i deeply sympathise with his general attitude towards this matter and i deeply sympathise with him in his own hereditary defect not least because we discovered in the corridor before the beginning of the debate that we are related <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two reasons for speaking in this debate <e> <s> first it seems to me that there is a very strong moral dimension in this debate and that therefore your lordships house might look for some contribution from these benches it deals with a people who have always looked to us in britain for protection and who have legitimate expectations of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise how difficult it is at this late stage to question the wisdom of this amendment which has come from another place <e> <s> i am conscious too as we all are that this house has spent a great deal of time on the issue <e> <s> i have carefully studied both the select committees report and the debates which followed it <e> <s> i should like to apologise that for a variety of reasons i was unable to attend any of those debates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord brightman has made some damaging criticisms of the amendment and yet it tries to say something important even though it says it in an imperfect way <e> <s> i suspect that if they had their will the movers of the amendment would have preferred a simple amendment to delete paragraph d from commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that was no doubt deemed to be impractical <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been told that i should say that i shall not move the item standing in my name on the order paper but i am nevertheless grateful to have the opportunity to draw to the attention of your lordships house the report of the archbishops commission on rural areas entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords motion not moved <e>"]
