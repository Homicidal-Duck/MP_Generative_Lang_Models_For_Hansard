["<cs> may i ask the noble baroness lady young to expand a little on what she said about academic qualifications <e> <s> she said pm vision would be made that only academically qualified children would be considered for assisted places or that is what i took her to say <e> <s> if i am right about that may i ask her to explain how it is proposed to ensure that the children are academically qualified in the way that will be required <e> <s> may i also ask whether any estimate has been made of the additional staff that would he required in the department of education and science to administer the schemeas well as the additional staff that would be required in the inspectorate for the duties that it will have when the scheme comes into effect if it ever does <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether any one of us is going to <e>", "<cs> my lords if one of the main motives in making this decision is to save manpower in the department of education and science may i ask whether the noble baroness and her colleagues have considered the proposal that has been put to them by the standing conference on rural community councils that a community building trust might receive the money that was formerly earmarked for village halls and village improvements <e> <s> that would mean that none of the burden of the work would fall on civil servants in the department for which the noble baroness is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble minister has referred to the aid the government have agreed should be sent to this stricken part of africa <e> <s> may i ask whether he feels that in all the circumstances the aid that is being sent is adequate or anywhere near adequate to the need <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with my noble friends lord donaldson and lord walston with me social democrats in welcoming the motion put before us today and introduced so ably by the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> i was particularly moved by what the noble lord lord sefton of garston had to say and very much welcomed too what my noble friend lady jeger has just said in her speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord orr-ewing who unfortunately has left us now in referring to the social democrats said that they do not seem to be doing anything in this debate at any rate except supporting what some of the labour speakers have said before them <e> <s> what i want to try to do while certainly supporting what labour speakers have said is also to show what one of the differences is as i see it between <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that answer may i ask if she has any estimates for the next year and can she give any idea this particularly worries me of cuts proposed for the coming financial year <e> <s> as i see it that will be the year of the real hard unfortunate truth for the voluntary bodies <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> my lords i return to my previous question why has there been so little resistance by local authorities to the pressure from central government to save money <e> <s> i suggest it stems from the dependence of local authorities on central government grants and on our archaic system of local rates a system which no government so far conservative or labour have wanted to reform <e> <s> if there had been some reform if some of the proposals put forward in the layfield report in the early seventies had been acted on by a government of either party there would to some extent at any rate have been a liberation of local authorities from control by whitehall and marsham street <e> <s> i believe the present government will go down in history as the most centralising government the country has ever had all because they have tried to take control of local expenditure and have used almost every means open to them along with the creation of new means to achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord vaizey in thanking the right reverend prelate for his very helpful speech <e> <s> i wish at the outset to refer as the noble lords lord vaizey and lord banks did to the royal commission on the distribution of income and wealth which met under the distinguished chairmanship of my fellow social democrat lord diamond <e> <s> despite the difficulties which lord vaizey mentioned of grappling with the statistics on this subject it marshalled so much evidence about the persisting inequality in our society that it is bound to be an important source book certainly for our new social democratic party as it develops its policy and i hope for other parties too in trying to learn from the lessons of the past in devising some new policies which will prove more effective than previous policies have done in reducing the extent of inequality in our society <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with what has been said by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> on grounds of common sense i do not understand why paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my fear is that by spelling it out in this way it could be implied that there is some restriction on the powers of the corporation <e> <s> the powers set out in paragraph <e>", "<cs> may i join with other noble lords who have spoken in support of this amendment <e> <s> i hope to move an amendment to clause which has already been mentioned and which bears on the same subject <e> <s> it seems to me that although we shall be debating the question again there would be considerable virtue in having in the bill the amendment which has been proposed to make it very clear at the outset that the telecom corporation has a duty of the kind listed here on top of the other duties which are also mentioned in this clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister one question <e> <s> the noble lord said that even if this amendment were accepted it would not be enforceable under subsection but likewise this must apply to all the duties which are set out in subsection and yet it is not thought to be without point to list the chief duties which are being imposed upon the corporation <e> <s> if it is not without point to insist that these four duties are duties even if they are not enforceable in this context why not accept that a further duty which would not be adding burdens to the post office but reassuring the public should be there along with the duties already listed even though not enforceable <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that the words especially at this time of night would be somewhat more comforting than the words we have just heard <e> <s> it was perhaps gruel when i was hoping for honey <e> <s> i am grateful for what the noble minister said about the customer audit which pounc has proposed and which seems to me to mark an important <e>", "<cs> my lords even if the minister is unable to announce any action would he at least be prepared to accept that all consumers would be behind lady burton in the kind of stance she has taken on so many occasions in this house <e> <s> if the minister accepts that can he give us any assurance at all that at some point in the future in response to what is a very general consumer opinion the government might awake from their torpor on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is able to make a statement about when the government will be able to say that they will upgrade the level of maternity grant in line with inflation instead of keeping it at its ridiculously low level of which as the noble lord knows was set as long ago as <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his remarks but naturally like other noble lords i was sorry because there were no surprises in his answer <e> <s> all noble lords who have spoken share the same views and of course some of us know a great deal more about the issue than others <e> <s> i fear that the ministers remarks when he spoke about as soon as may be represented very little advance on what we heard earlier from the home secretary when he used the phrase as soon as possible <e> <s> although the minister was not able to say anything more firm today i hope he will convey to his colleagues the reasonable strength of feeling there is on this question and express the hope that there will be legislation next session <e> <s> that would be welcome by the british business community by the medical profession and by all those concerned with civil liberties in this country <e> <s> i greatly hope it will be possible for the government to act on the matter not just as soon as may be but with a particular timetable attached <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment having been persuaded to do so by the speeches made by my noble and learned friends lord elwyn-jones and lord gardiner <e> <s> it seems that the government are seriously under-rating the extent of public anxiety on this very important subject and i hope that even at this late hour there may be some sign that there will be some reconsideration <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister would not expect me to be convinced by his arguments nor am i his first argument was that if my amendment was accepted a local authority of whatever size would be able to run a telephone service and this seemed to the noble lord the minister to be self-evidently ridiculous <e> <s> however it does not seem ridiculous to me and neither does it seem ridiculous to the drafter of the clause we are considering no limitation on the size of the local authority is referred to in clause and if there is no limitation on the size of the local authority in the main part of the clause why should it be ridiculous to have no limitation on the size of the local authority in the proposed amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i was just coming to that point <e> <s> the noble lord the minister said that the disadvantage of a municipal service and he has just repeated it is that it is the ratepayers who would <e>", "<cs> the noble ministers last remarks seemed to me to be on the same lines as the remarks we heard from him earlier <e> <s> it seems that the noble minister is unable to see the close parallel there is between the arguments that could be advanced about private firms and the arguments that could be advanced about local authorities <e> <s> the noble minister said that no local authority would be able to get into this business because they have so much to learn <e> <s> could not the same thing be said of a private company which may come into existence precisely because of the operation of this bill no it cannot be done because there will be so much to learn and so much expertise to gather <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this if he has definitely made up his mind that there is no legal case has he any other action in mind short of prosecution that would remedy the grave state of affairs to which my noble friend lady burton has so often drawn attention <e> <s> surely there is some other step he is proposing to take and he is not going to sit in his place facing these questions day in week in year in and out without taking any action whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be prepared at any rate to consider urging the charity commission to pay proper respect to the wishes of the donor of kelmscott house in <e> <s> it was the clear intention of the donor that the premises should be used for the benefit of the william morris <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i also have been trying to get up for quite a time and so i hope that i may be added to the list <e>", "<cs> my lords encouraged by what the noble lord the foreign secretary said about being sad about the somali service and by what the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford said at the beginning of his speech i propose to concentrate on the proposed abolition of this particular vernacular service <e> <s> it is a small service it is necessarily in somali because very few people in the horn of africa speak english even in what was formerly british somaliland <e> <s> it costs about a year it has a staff of eight and a weekly output of seven hours <e> <s> though small it is highly effective <e> <s> each one of its somali newsreaders is known personally throughout the length and breadth of the country <e> <s> yesterday our wedding day was in somalia as throughout the somali-speaking world known as bbc day <e> <s> all wednesdays are known as bbc day because of the extra coverage that is given to them <e> <s> its first transmission today a few hours before this debate began was listened to as on other days by groups of to people gathered around a radio set in the city of mogadishu in the towns of the country by the nomads in the desert and above all by the refugees in the refugee camps in that country <e> <s> refugees have been forced to flee across the border from ethiopia by what the ethiopian army has done in the ogaden and other provinces of ethiopia backed as that army is by russian advisers and cuban troops <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord permit me to ask him a question <e> <s> in putting forward that view which is perfectly understandable has he taken account of the fact that in many parts of the world particularly the poorer parts of the world almost the whole of africa for instance there is no television service and the only way in which there can be communication is via the radio <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he will accept that one unique characteristic of the bbc transcription service of which he has spoken is that there is a charge for it <e> <s> i think there is no other service in the world that would charge for transcription and my question is <e>", "<cs> my lords would lord trefgarne be prepared to accept that in the other place the minister gave the figure of million as being the number of somali speakers in the middle east and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down on the question that i put to him specifically can he say that there definitely will be a response in full from the government to this report and that there will not be a period of waiting until the swann report is published <e> <s> i also hope that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was rather implying that there has been a complete response <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the great honour to be the first person to rise after the noble viscount and the first who is able to congratulate him on a speech that he has actually made rather than the speech that he will make <e> <s> i was particularly delighted in the matter of his speech because it happens to accord with my own views and with what i shall say in a moment <e> <s> but even if i had not been i should have wanted to congratulate him on his manner of delivering it <e> <s> i am sure that the house has benefited from hearing him today and will benefit from his experience on future occasions over many years to come <e> <s> again i should like to congratulate him on a most excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i should also like to thank as have other speakers the noble baroness lady trumpington for having the temerity to introduce once again a bill on this subject this hoary subject by now and for giving us all another chance of considering it <e> <s> i should say that i have an interest in this matter in my capacity as president of the consumers association and a former chairman of the national consumer council but at least i think i can <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to ask him how he squares what he has just said with the evident success of the co-op hyper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question on that point <e> <s> if the noble lord is right how can he explain what has happened in scotland where the sunday trading provisions do not apply and where only a minority of shops have taken advantage of the law <e> <s> why should scotland be so different from what might happen in england <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer one more question about the central thesis that he has so admirably set out but still mystifyingly so <e> <s> he has said that there cannot be government action on this point because there is not general agree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jacques did not seem to me to speak in the warmest possible terms about the consumer activist lobby which is what he thought it right to call it <e> <s> speaking on behalf of that lobby and on this question i believe that i can speak for the consumers association and for the national consumer council i should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord jacques for the sign of movement that there has been on his part <e> <s> i should like to support what the noble baroness lady trumpington has already said in expressing her gratitude to the noble lord lord jacques and those who are with him on this point <e> <s> it does represent a considerable advance <e> <s> in one way one could say that the co-operative movement and we hope that the noble lord lord jacques speaks for the co-operative movement is not now going to regard sunday trading as wholly wrong but only wrong in the afternoons <e> <s> although that might not seem on the face of it such a large advance it seems to me that if a change in the law of this kind was made the people of this country would find shopping a good deal easier and would feel more sure about where they stood <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow other noble lords in thanking mr willey for introducing the bill in the first place and the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with all those who have spoken before me in thanking my noble friend lord kilmarnock for opening the debate on this grim subject that we are discussing on this fine summer afternoon <e> <s> my noble friend lord kilmarnock said that whatever scheme was adopted and he like me is very much in favour of this task force report it must catch the imagination of the young people themselves <e> <s> i would be a little less ambitious than he was when he said that in saying that at least any new scheme that is introduced must not be scorned by young people as it could be in my view if the training allowances paid to them are any less than those proposed in this report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter mentioned the need to ban heavy vehicles from entering central london <e> <s> turning to cars rather than lorries may i ask the noble earl the minister whether he personally has considered or perhaps the government have considered the case which seems to me a strong one for supplementary licences for car owners entering central london in the day time <e> <s> that should both reduce congestion and raise more revenue for the improvement of public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others who have spoken in thanking lord beloff for opening this debate tonight and i should especially like to thank him for the moderate tone he adopted <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ardwick said the tone he adopted tonight was rather different from the tone he adopted in the evidence which is recorded in this report and for that i and others here i think will be grateful <e> <s> the noble lord has never concealed his attitude to the social science research council nor indeed to much that goes on under the name of social science or social studies or whatever you might like to call it but it seems to me and i am bound to say this somewhat odd that after this report has been produced he should wish still to pursue the matter even in the moderate way that he did in opening this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to ask him in what way he thinks the natural sciences are different from the social sciences in the light of what he has just said about this continuing debate and the lack of firm answers <e> <s> surely the same thing applies to the natural sciences as to the so-called social sciences <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to put a question and to make a clarification <e> <s> i have no objection at all to surveyors and the like being members of boards of building societies <e> <s> what i was objecting to was the fact that any commissions they receive because of work they do for building societies on whose boards they sit are not recorded and particularly are they not recorded in the annual accounts of building societies <e> <s> the spalding report discussed this matter and specifically recommended that there should not be recording of commissions received and the like in the annual accounts <e> <s> this seems to me to be wrong <e> <s> i was not objecting at all to the presence of these people on the boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just slightly puzzled because the noble lord lord marshall of leeds came in late and we have already heard all of this read out from end to end by the noble lord lord plummer of st marylebone <e> <s> i was only thinking that the noble lord was not making a very good case for the societies in which he believes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for that reply but may i press him a little further about it <e> <s> i take it he is aware that not only are boc a major supplier but they in fact supply nearly per cent <e> <s> of the medical gases which are supplied to the national health service <e> <s> in view of that and in view of the information which has come to light recently would the noble lord be prepared to go further and actively encourage the office of fair trading to make sure that the undertakings given by the british oxygen company after the monopolies commission inquiry are taken up <e> <s> does he agree that every care should in fact be taken to ensure that those undertakings are being honoured <e> <s> further to that would it not be better to encourage active competition with the british oxygen company <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness also aware that the bbc approached the british council with a view to getting financial support and it was only when that and other attempts failed that the bbc decided to go into partnership with the japanese concern in order to extend british influence in the world <e> <s> is that not all to be very much welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for taking the initiative in introducing this bill <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to speak on its behalf <e> <s> in view of the persuasiveness at least to me of the speech we have just heard i should like also to express the hope that if the speech he has prepared has a certain lukewarm aspect to it the noble lord the minister who is to reply to the debate will in the light of the speech that has been made be prepared to scrap what has been written and adopt a much more friendly attitude than he might otherwise have taken to this bill <e> <s> if he is prepared to do that it will be a most important occasion in the history of an already rather long drawn-out campaign <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment which stands in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> this clause as amended is perhaps the most important clause in the whole of the bill <e> <s> if nothing else were accepted in this committee at least it would be a considerable achievement to give to london the same opportunity of having urban parishes as is given to the rest of the country even though the procedures need to be improved elsewhere <e> <s> the abercrombie report of long ago some noble lords may remember that it came out just after the war referred to london as a city of urban villages <e> <s> those who live in london today can i think say that to a large extent that is still rather miraculously the case <e> <s> even inside london the patriotism of the parish still matters <e> <s> if this clause were passed it would give some framework for the patriotism of the parish to express itself in a practical way <e> <s> so i hope that the amendment can be accepted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone has put the point very well already <e> <s> but i hope that the minister will bear fully in mind the fact that this bill clearly has support from all parts of the committee <e> <s> that is of some significance <e> <s> one of the real values of parish councils is that they bring into civic life people who do not necessarily want to belong to a political party or serve as a political party representative <e> <s> they are non-party political bodies <e> <s> london like other cities in other parts of the country would benefit from bringing into civic life some excellent people perhaps many excellent people as rural parish councils have done who would not come into ordinary councils which are so much dominated by ordinary party politics <e> <s> when considering further what might be the reaction to the appeal of the noble lord lord mottistone i hope that that point will also be borne fully in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord mottistone in thanking the noble lord lord brimelow for his introduction of the debate this evening <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the select committee on its excellent report <e> <s> the report was well summed up in the headline for the press release that was issued when the report was published at the end of july <e> <s> it said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord bauer on his excellent and simple speech which i hope will be a model for me and others to come <e> <s> i should like to join with others those who are not here as well as those who are in expressing gratitude to the noble earl not only for opening the debate today but for doing it with such a memorable speech and also for providing such a memorable sight which i shall remember for the rest of my life <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> he has covered many points but is he able to say something about government purchasing policy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question too <e> <s> the right reverend prelate was good enough to say that he agreed with certain parts of the bill <e> <s> would he be so kind as to give your lordships an indication of which parts he agrees with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to join the members of this house who have supported this bill this afternoon and this evening <e> <s> i am especially glad to join my old friend the noble lord lord sainsbury on this bench because his word on this should carry more weight than mine <e> <s> that is because he has changed his mind after considering the evidence and considering the changes in the situation in the country whereas i have not changed my mind i think at any point in the past years on the principle behind this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the right reverend prelate for that <e> <s> i accept fully what he says but even so for this coalition to suggest that church bookstalls should now be included in its list of exemptions strikes me as extraordinary <e> <s> why should church bookstalls be preferred in this way when if this proposal were followed small shopkeepers round the corner would be subject to the full weight of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that there is a great deal of disquiet in the country <e> <s> first there is the fact that in its new premium phone-in services the privatised british telecom is profiting from among other things a wide range of pornographic phone-in call-up-a-girl services which are ever more widely advertised in pornographic magazines <e> <s> secondly is the minister aware that the new phone-in services are advertised at what are called m rates <e> <s> is he aware further that people do not understand that m rates which are the charge rates for these new phone-in services mean that quite local calls are charged at the same rate as calls to the republic of ireland of all places which is times the rate of a local call and which is chosen by british telecom only because it is the most expensive rate it has <e> <s> does the noble lord not think <e>", "<cs> that british telecom should come clean about the rates which are being charged <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the congratulations that have been given to the government for introducing this bill <e> <s> i particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by declaring an interest <e> <s> i am the chairman of the college of health <e> <s> the college has an offshoot called health line which is a telephone information service that includes aids in its coverage <e> <s> we started the service on the subject of aids in november <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord donaldson for initiating this debate and giving me a chance to say a few words about a problem that has been only touched on so far the new disease of aids in prisons <e> <s> i do not want to level criticism at prison officers governors or anyone in prisons but rather if any criticism is justified and i think that it is at the home office and the government behind it for not making enough resources available to deal with that dreadful new problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the general congratulations to the noble lord lord trafford on a most powerful speech <e> <s> i was most impressed as i am sure we all were <e> <s> i am also sure that the noble lord would not want to be left with the impression on this occasion that we are always in agreement <e> <s> that certainly would not be giving the right impression and i am not going to join in the chorus of praise for this bill <e> <s> i am afraid i am going to disagree with everyone who has spoken so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to ask of a valued colleague a question that could be thought to be in any way critical <e> <s> does my noble friend accept that that there are many people employed by authorities to provide the services mentioned in paragraph who while concerned with aids patients are not wholly or mainly engaged with them <e> <s> they are members of wider teams in hospitals and employed by district health authorities <e> <s> one of their jobs is to deal with aids patients <e> <s> merely to pick out those who are wholly or mainly dealing with them could surely give a wrong impression <e> <s> does that cause him some disquiet <e>", "<cs> my lords emboldened by what has just been so well expressed may i add just one point if the house will bear with me <e> <s> mr newton did extraordinarily well in the other place in coming together with members there to improve the bill <e> <s> can i ask the noble baroness in all sincerity whether she would be prepared to consider putting some suitable guarantee of confidentiality into the bill at later stages <e> <s> it may not be possible easily to get it right <e> <s> if the noble baroness were prepared to work with sympathetic people in this house it might be possible to produce some kind of guarantee or at any rate statement about confidentiality that would go a long way to allay fears and might do a great deal for the way this disease is handled in the coming years <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot really let that go the lonely little cuckoo <e> <s> i feel that on this issue of confidentiality which baulks in many peoples minds there would be a good deal of support for an attempt to do something <e> <s> i rest my case and implore the minister to consider that if not tonight then at any rate on some future occasion as a constructive way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt for one moment <e> <s> will it be the case that voluntary bodies will be compelled in any way to <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by apologising for my cold and the effect it has on my voice but at least it will mean that i shall try to be very brief not only to save noble lords but also to save myself <e>", "<cs> the last contribution was particularly helpful because it threw light on what is behind this clause but it almost inevitably raised further questions <e> <s> the issue which was raised is the relationship between the targets the programmes of study and assessment arrangements that will be provided under this clause and what is provided by the examination boards for the children who are able to take various kinds of examinations <e>", "<cs> if that is the case and it seems highly reasonable we are being asked to divide the foundation subjects into two categories <e> <s> music art and physical education are being considered in a different category from history geography and technology <e> <s> it seems eminently sensible to me <e> <s> how can one lay down a detailed programme of work for music when conditions from one school to another differ so much with regard to instrument teaching in all sorts of ways <e>", "<cs> would the minister not think it would be in the interests of clarity since we have been confused by this other people may well be in the future if in line it was stated that the secretary of state may by order specify in relation to each of the core and other foundation subjects <e> <s> that brings a degree of repetition into that sentence which would make it much clearer <e> <s> if it had been there we would have saved about minutes of our time this afternoon quite apart from anything else <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me that the criticisms that have been made from many quarters about the dirigism which underlies so much of this bill would be tempered in a tiny featherlight way if the amendment were taken on board by the government <e> <s> the wording may not be suitable but one would hope that the general intent of the amendment might be taken up and incorporated sensibly into the final structure of the bill <e>", "<cs> as the father of a schizophrenic son i also support the amendment <e> <s> in the education world generally among people who have great concern for special needs there has been a great deal of unease about the bill <e> <s> although that unease will not be removed if the amendment is accepted it would be somewhat appeased <e> <s> the people who have felt so disturbed would be somewhat reassured if the government were able to make a small concession at this stage in the discussion of the bill <e> <s> it would not lose any of its guts but it would be reassuring to perhaps hundreds of thousands of people who are deeply worried about what might happen to their children and grand-children who have such needs unless something like this is accepted and followed up in other ways that have more content even than this <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can support the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i was convinced by the welcome words of the minister about freedom that the clause should be done away with completely <e> <s> i am sure we should be better without it at least as presently drafted <e> <s> the great pioneers of british education would certainly not have asked for permission to experiment or develop and their counterparts at this or any other time

<e> <s> one only needs to provide for permission to experiment if the permission might be withheld and it should not be withheld <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assure the noble lord that i had no such thing in mind <e> <s> i cannot think how this situation arose <e> <s> i feel that i must have been far less clear that i tried to be <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord peston is agreeing with me at least he has a smile on his face <e> <s> the whole thrust of the amendment is very much in line with what the noble lord was saying <e> <s> it is because children are not alike their parents are not alike their interests are unlike and their needs are unlike that they need different kinds of schools <e> <s> it is because they are unlike that i am arguing for unlike schools to be permitted <e>", "<cs> i am happy to answer the question posed by the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i hope that when he gets what i trust he will consider as being a satisfactory answer he will then feel able to support the two amendments <e> <s> as i see them they are certainly on this particular point equally open <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness will give way <e> <s> the objection about the curriculum seems to apply immediately to the city technology colleges themselves <e> <s> but they are to be allowed to have a broad curriculum which nevertheless gives special emphasis to science and technology <e> <s> that same provision could apply equally well to many of the other kinds of schools that are in mind <e>", "<cs> i cannot admit to anything but disappointment <e> <s> i wish however to express the hope that there might be second thoughts enabling even this amendment to be reviewed well after it has left this chamber <e> <s> a tiny slender hope was held out about the closer and perhaps clearer delineation of the criteria for the granting of voluntary aided status to new schools <e> <s> perhaps something can be built on that <e> <s> therefore in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my support to what has been said <e> <s> anyone who has seen a primary school where the arts are taken really seriously knows that where work that excels is taking place it is quite impossible to say this is music this is painting or whatever <e> <s> often there is an amalgam of drama and music and also painting and crafts coming in <e> <s> people move in different parts of the room moving from one territory to another without there being any distinction between them <e>", "<cs> my lords might i say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply particularly given the shortage of time <e> <s> perhaps i may say a brief word about some of the points made in the debate <e> <s> in referring to the parent which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter objected to i am following the precedent of the later amendment which refers to the parent <e> <s> i believe that what is implied is that either of the parents could object by requesting in writing that the child should not be submitted to testing <e> <s> i do not believe that it is implied that we are only speaking of single-parent families but rather that the right attaches to both parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment although i have no particular views about lewes <e> <s> the debate has been rather strained <e> <s> in large part it seems to have been a debate about the merits and demerits of the four <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the chorus of support for the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i was wholly convinced by what the noble baroness lady faithfull said <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted it would show that the government were as concerned about children with special needs as they have said on occasion that they are <e> <s> as i see it it is a test of sincerity and i greatly hope partly in view of the so far universal support that has been given here to the noble baroness that the government will also feel that they can accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i hope the government will be able to introduce a measure of this kind <e> <s> unless we have before us the figures and the information which will come from such action no one will ever know a what is the extent of truancy and b what the trends are and whether the situation is getting worse or better <e> <s> most people believe truancy is getting worse but they do not have any figures to show how far the problem is worsening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like the city technology colleges <e> <s> they are too grand too big and they will be too narrowly specialist <e> <s> however if one does not like them i do not believe that one should go so far as some noble lords have and in effect reject the idea of specialist schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her reply and for the small comforts that she held out they are comforts <e> <s> i am grateful as i am sure is the noble baroness lady cox to the minister for having considered the amendment <e> <s> we look forward to a great advance and development in the range and number of voluntary-aided schools <e> <s> onward let us go while i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness lady cox on many important issues <e> <s> however when it comes to london i feel that she speaks about a very different london from that which i know <e> <s> i have had the privilege of working in tower hamlets since <e> <s> there is increasing dismay in that borough at the prospect of what the government have in mind <e> <s> there is special dismay among the members of the bengali ethnic community and among the somali chinese and vietnamese communities all of which are well represented in the borough <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon what the noble lord lord st john of fawsley has said i should like to give the government amendment a moderate welcome and also speak in support of my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is not that i like city technology colleges but i should dislike them less if those new colleges were not to be confined to science and technology alone <e> <s> i am hoping against hope that even at this hour it may be possible to persuade the minister to take a more broad-minded view and go a little further than the amendment in her name <e>", "<cs> to circumscribe in this way is to recognise on the face of the bill that the arts matter but only if they are pulled along by the chariot of technology secondary and subservient <e> <s> that in itself is to denigrate the arts <e> <s> it means that there could be no schools like cheetham secondary school in manchester which specialises in music and which has been so flourishing unless presumably the whole emphasis in such a school was on electronic music which would be absurd <e> <s> there would be no new visual arts school like the arts secondary school which used to flourish in manchester unless it were devoted to the chemistry of pigmentation or the optics of colour or some such matters and presumably no ballet schools at all <e> <s> i do not see how technology can be allied to the ballet in a way that would bring it within what the government are proposing <e>", "<cs> yes robots <e> <s> not many of us would want to attend covent garden to see a performance of robots <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house perhaps i may point out how it should read <e> <s> at page line it should read <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be allowed to say a word as an unexpected supporter of the excellent bill of the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i rise to support what has just been said about this amendment <e> <s> i hope that it will be the case that the noble lord lord mottistone will feel able to accept it <e> <s> i thought the arguments presented were cogent <e> <s> all i wish to do now is to instance one other circumstance which i think the noble lord lord ennals passed over in any event he certainly did not dwell upon it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add yet another point in support of the stand of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> if words such as those suggested by the noble lord lord mottistone were added which would provide that a person should be under a duty where he thinks that it is in the best interests of the person concerned to give information and so forth and the person in question thinks that way that person would give the information in any case <e> <s> the reasoning seems straightforward <e> <s> if that were the case it would look as though the subsection was unnecessary because it would be adding something which in practice would make no difference to what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by apologising to the house and to the noble lord lord peston for the unfortunate fact that i was not able to be present in the chamber at the start of the debate <e> <s> i want to point out what has been <e>", "<cs> i refer briefly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not intend to speak now about my amendment no <e> <s> which i hope will be called when we reach clause but the two amendments are closely connected <e> <s> if my amendment were not to succeed i should certainly be in favour of this amendment because it would be better to have the national accreditation board which is proposed rather than nothing at all <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there is a need for much more general and purposive co-ordination of road transport not only on this matter <e> <s> that applies especially in london which the government have deprived of any all-london local authority with responsibility for transport roads and many other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount satisfied with that answer <e>", "<cs> i agree with almost everything that my noble friend lady phillips said <e> <s> however does she agree that provided that the support services are good it is better for people to leave hospital as soon as they decently can partly because hospitals can be dangerous places <e> <s> the emphasis should not be so much by way of criticism of the hospitals but of the support services linked to the hospitals <e> <s> all those concerned with the health service know that those services are by no means adequate <e> <s> people are sent out before they should be but you cannot lay the blame entirely at the door of the hospitals <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness would allow me to answer her <e> <s> as i understand it since when the practice was changed on the directions of the secretary of state hmi reports are made available to the public <e> <s> hmis have had to develop the skills of tact and diplomacy <e> <s> they are aware that if they cite individual teachers and other people unfavourably it will not necessarily have a good effect <e> <s> in most of the reports that i have seen they manage by and large to make it clear that some things are not right in a school college or whatever it may be but they almost always refrain from pinning the blame on individuals <e> <s> the people inside who receive the report know much more about what is written between the lines than the people who read it on the outside <e> <s> if there are parents in that case or other people who are interested they <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank the minister for the reply that she has given although i did not find it as convincing as i had hoped <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the happy consensus and express the hope that the proverbial blind telescope may for once be used <e> <s> the fact is that there are general practitioners and general practices which are following exactly the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness in favour of cash limits despite what the secretary of state has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome what the minister said <e> <s> it certainly went beyond what i was expecting or hoping for <e> <s> i particularly welcome what i took to be an assurance that there will be further consideration and discussion before the bill is finally put to bed on what action should be taken as regards the very difficult issues of monitoring quality control and so on <e> <s> i hope that as a result of that it will be possible for the government to come back with a different amendment either when we reach amendment no <e> <s> or at third reading <e> <s> that would be very welcome <e> <s> i hope that i am not expecting too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that there has not been a little more give on the subject since it was discussed previously in this house <e> <s> i hope that there will be more give tonight <e> <s> from the beginning of the reform as it is called which the bill represents and since the publication of the white paper it has been said that its main purpose is to improve the service offered to consumers <e> <s> the proposals for the internal market and other proposals are designed to improve the service to consumers that is the patients and their families and to do so at an economic cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i argued that the government have said on various occasions that the reforms will improve matters in various respects for the consumer <e> <s> if that is so as surely it must be then it seems very odd that representatives should not be able to attend meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment on the grounds that everything possible should be done to encourage early diagnosis and treatment of the kinds of diseases that the noble lord lord kilmarnock mentioned <e> <s> it would surely be a tragedy and in this i agree with the noble baroness lady cox if any district health authority were to say that it would not provide the services because it could not obtain repayment at a time of perhaps great economic and financial stringency <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the arguments advanced by lady wilcox on the occasion to which the noble lord lord ennals referred were extremely powerful <e> <s> they have been put forward before <e> <s> they were put forward when i was the first chairman of that body the national consumer council <e> <s> and have been put forward on many occasions by the consumers association of which i am president <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> there are three main advantages in giving the group the power to initiate and report <e> <s> first it would improve the quality of the people who could be attracted as members of the group or as staff to work for it <e> <s> that would be the case if the group were entrusted with the power to choose its own subjects to inquire into in addition to acting on the remits of the health ministers <e> <s> secondly it would improve the confidence of the public as was said by the noble lord lord kilmarnock if it were made clear that the group had at least a degree of independence <e> <s> thirdly it would improve the quality of the work that is done because it would raise the standing of the group in general <e> <s> that would occur if it were accepted that the group had the degree of independence which would be implied if it were able to choose at least some of the subjects for inquiry <e>"]
