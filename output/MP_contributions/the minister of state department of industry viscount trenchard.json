opportunity for what will i am quite sure be a most interesting debate <e> <s> i hope that he can commiserate with me standing here for the first time as i discovered before the debate that he too had not actually moved a motion and certainly not in opposition from the front bench <e> <s> so that your lordships are in the hands of the greenhorns today and i hope that we may have your tolerance

reference to gobbledygook and also to his phrase on the previous measure that one can be too learned about these things <e> <s> i reflected that all these remarks are relative but i hope that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who is to speak after me will if necessary pronounce the words in clause in the language of the principality <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and in order to give my noble friend lord belstead time to consider the many points raised by the noble lord lord shinwell may i at this point repeat a statement made in the other place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity provided by my noble friend lord campbell of croy to say a few words on the very difficult position of the scottish steel industry <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall not satisfy either him or the noble lord lord lee of newton in the amount that i am able to say at the moment in

state for industry <e> <s> the statement reads <e>", "<cs> my lords as many noble lords have already said this debate has shown this house at its best <e> <s> i would echo the governments thanks to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing it at this stage which is also timely <e> <s> i would also add not only the governments thanks but their real appreciation of the existence of this royal commission report and of the law commissioners report and of the value that the government attach to those documents in the task that my right honourable friend has in front of her at the moment in reviewing the many learned contributions to this great problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this very short bill one of the shortest on record covers two important shipbuilding items <e> <s> it provides for an increase in british shipbuilders statutory borrowing powers and it widens the scope of the home credit scheme to include con

<e> <s> i am aware that your lordships were told from our front bench that the statement on agriculture would come first <e> <s> i understand that the order of the statements has been changed in the other place but i should just like to pause for a second and ask have i the leave of the house to repeat the statement on the post office now <e>", "<cs> my lords the community outward processing regulation is expected to permit but not to require member states to confine access to any separate outward processing facilities to manufacturers <e> <s> the draft regulation is still being discussed between member states <e> <s> however the delay has no direct effect in this country because the united kingdom counts outward processed goods against normal restraint levels <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of industry already funds a comprehensive programme of minerals investigation designed to promote the economic development of our indigenous resources <e> <s> this includes mapping and reconnaissance programmes carried out by the institute of geological sciences which aim at providing necessary geological information on which subsequent minerals exploration by companies can be based

administration are concerned <e> <s> so many of these matters are currently under review <e> <s> if i may i shall leave the urgency in the tone of her speech and the way that she recommended her specific measures until the end of my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by saying that i recognise the sincerity of all the views that have been expressed today and the very great knowledge behind a great many of them especially those of the two former chairmen of the metrication board <e> <s> i shall draw all the detailed points that they have made to the attention of my right honourable friend and we also in the department of industry will study them very closely <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place in

redundancy areas <e> <s> thirdly retraining costs also attract a contribution from the eec social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> it has three main purposes one of which your lordships will probably regard as being the most important <e> <s> it changes the powers and policy of the national enterprise board the scottish development agency and the welsh development agency in line with that changed policy it allows the english industrial estates corporation to operate in a new and we believe more commercial way it tidies up the orders and the use of the secretary of states discretion in relation to regional policy and fourthly it deals with a number of miscellaneous but important points that i shall mention in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start by saying that if i get some of the welsh names wrong i hope that my place of birth will be adequate excuse <e> <s> i asked those briefing me to make sure that they did not put in any of the more complicated ones <e> <s> i am afraid that i could not follow all the marvellous hymn which was so beautifully sung by the noble lord lord maelor <e> <s> i shall be very interested to read <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the government made very clear in another place on th february that they are determined to preserve the sub-post office network <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of <e>", "<cs> my lords the british steel corporations trading results since the financial year have

government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e> <s> in putting forward this motion i should like to explain that if it meets with the wishes of the house we shall try to deal quite briefly with the very large number of technical amendments to those main parts of the bill which were under consideration for some considerable time in this house <e> <s> if noble lords wish to deal in detail with commons amendments and the reasons for them other than where there are amendments down we shall of course explain them <e> <s> however at the moment we

this bill <e>", "<cs> i am afraid we do resist the removal of the clause for the reasons my noble friend has already outlined principally that we do not want the neb or the agencies to scatter their efforts widely <e> <s> they have never used these powers <e> <s> there is nothing to stop any other government body or private body which has an opportunity to sell know how of any kind overseas approaching any body including these agencies in order to study any particular skills products or what-have <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> what he mentions relates to the selection of industries not to the selection of an individual for an important nationalised industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time

explained in another place on th august it was only with very great regret that we concluded that there is no satisfactory way to alter the compensation terms <e> <s> it is no part of traditional conservative principles to remedy one unfairness by creating new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords the review of the consumer interest in the nationalised industries commissioned by my right honourable friend the minister of state for consumer affairs is progressing and my right honourable friend expects to receive a report later in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend who introduced this hexham question will forgive me for one moment i should like very briefly to make the odd point while declining to go into a debate on the industrial situation which the noble lord will no doubt find
