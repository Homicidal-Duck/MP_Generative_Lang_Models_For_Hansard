["<cs> my lords i very much welcome this debate which has been initiated by the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh <e> <s> i echo his sentiments that our arrangements for both civil and home defence are totally inadequate <e> <s> i would go further and say that they are virtually non-existent <e> <s> many years ago i was rather soundly rebuked in this house for suggesting that there was a need for home defence <e> <s> since that time it has become more and more apparent to me that this need exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the horn of africa <e> <s> the horn of africa is a very troubled part of the world <e> <s> its troubles have been and still are rather overshadowed by events going on in other parts of the world <e> <s> the troubles in the horn of africa arise from political and natural causes primarily the prolonged drought <e> <s> that has affected the cropping and grazing of this area bringing with it a disastrous loss of food and of livestock thereby denying the inhabitants of this part of africa the means of life and livelihood <e> <s> i have heard today that as of this week some rain has fallen in that part of the world but it is not yet enough to make a dramatic change <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that very welcome reply may i ask whether her majestys government are aware that the voluntary youth organisations in scotland were urged to put in and did their bids to the minister for these grants at a very early date especially to avoid such a delay and that this delay has caused hardship and made future planning exceedingly difficult indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord jenkins will forgive me if i do not follow him in the realms of nuclear disarmament <e> <s> recently i had occasion to visit the horn of africa somalia in particular <e> <s> i would like to say at the outset how very much i welcome her majestys governments decision to continue the bbc external broadcasts in the somali language <e> <s> during my stay in that country i had very great evidence brought to me of the respect and regard in which this service was held and the great concern being caused by the thought that it might have to cease <e> <s> i am delighted that this is not to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be very interested to learn whether her majestys government have had any further thoughts regarding their policy towards the horn of africa and its neighbouring countries and ocean <e> <s> since i asked that question in june this year during the last session certain events have taken place <e> <s> early in july somalia was invaded by ethiopia <e> <s> at the outset every endeavour was made to give the impression that this was the work of somali dissidents who were only aided by ethopia these dissidents being under the impression that they had only to enter somalia for the government of president siad barre to fall <e> <s> in this they were totally mistaken <e> <s> the somali people whether or not they like the government they have certainly do not wish for any government that is supported by ethiopia and they have made that completely plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i welome this debate <e> <s> as a result of my journeys and my contacts with the various countries which form part of the horn of africa and the neighbouring countries and oceans i am very concerned about the extent of soviet penetration in that area <e> <s> on previous occasions i have drawn your lordships attention to the pact of aden which was mentioned by my noble friend lord cathcart <e> <s> this is a soviet-inspired alliance between ethiopia south yemen and libya an alliance in which the signatories bind themselves among many other things to promote the common revolutionary struggles and to support both african and arab liberation movements <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i agree with every word <e> <s> i had intended to come to this matter by a different <e>", "<cs> my lords i must at the outset welcome the gracious speech <e> <s> i must say also that i will diverge from the main topic of tonights discussion which is defence and go far more into the area of foreign affairs and into a specific area of foreign affairs that relating to the horn of africa <e> <s> this area does have a bearing on our defence <e> <s> as some of your lordships will well remember a short while ago we were discussing the possibility of the soviet union and her allies having an influence in that area <e> <s> certainly in my view it is vitally important that her majestys government takes steps to ensure that our interests are held in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that recent events in ethiopia have served to concentrate our minds on the many problems of the horn of africa <e> <s> i must at the outset congratulate her majestys government on the manner in which they have responded to ethiopias call for aid to deal with the tremendous probems it faced in dealing with the severe shortage of food in its northern provinces <e> <s> i equally know that the ethiopeans and the ethiopian government are deeply appreciative of all that has been done not only by her majestys government but by the people of this country in order to assist them in this hour of need <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a few comments concerning the problem of unemployment <e> <s> while i am fully prepared to accept that there are over million persons currently drawing unemployment benefit i find it difficult to believe that there are a similar number who are actually desiring to work <e> <s> i get the feeling that there is a lack of will and a lack of desire to work <e> <s> some years ago i had the privilege of being in charge of an organisation which <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord grenfell on his most excellent and informative maiden speech <e> <s> perhaps i may ask that he stops over more often on his journey between africa and the united states because we could listen to him time and time again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that the noble viscount lord thurso has raised this question <e> <s> i am astonished by the attitude taken by the department of health and social services to her majestys volunteer reserve <e> <s> it is utterly disgraceful that a young man who is prepared to undertake the commitments and training that is required to enable him to take his place alongside his regular counterparts should be penalised because he is drawing either unemployment or supplementary benefit <e> <s> i am well aware that he is paid while he is training either in or out of camp but his pay is taxed at source <e> <s> now we have those who are in the receipt of unemployment or <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive me as a layman for intervening in this learned debate <e> <s> my experience with the scottish courts civil and criminal is slight but such as it is it leads me to slight concern about this bill <e> <s> i have known of a dean of faculty lie in court <e> <s> i know of false evidence being given under oath <e> <s> so the idea of hearsay being readily acceptable in a court gives me some cause for concern <e> <s> i am not aware that in any place hearsay is defined <e> <s> where does hearsay stop and gossip begin <e> <s> this worries me because while we hear that it is fine when you get into court it is slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words about the horn of africa and in particular about somalia <e> <s> somalia has been an independent state for years following the independence given to the former protectorate of british somaliland and italian somalia <e> <s> this year is president said barres th year in office <e> <s> until last year somalia had a very unhappy and unsettled relationship with its neighbour ethiopia <e> <s> it had open warfare aerial bombardments invasions and every other means of difficulty thrust in its way <e>"]
