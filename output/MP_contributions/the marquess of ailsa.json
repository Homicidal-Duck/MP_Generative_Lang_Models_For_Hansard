["<cs> my lords i very much welcome this debate which has been initiated by the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh <e> <s> i echo his sentiments that our arrangements for both civil and home defence are totally inadequate <e> <s> i would go further and say that they are virtually non-existent <e> <s> many years ago i was rather soundly rebuked in this house for suggesting that there was a need for home defence <e> <s> since that time it has become more and more apparent to me that this need exists <e>"]
