["<cs> my lords inevitably in our proceedings this afternoon there will be an element of <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will echo the hope of the noble lord lord gladwyn that her majestys visit to lusaka will be very helpful to the commonwealth of which she is the head and that the conference will end in success <e> <s> for a foreign secretary no debate on rhodesia during the last years can be said to have been timely and i have no doubt that my noble friend would today have preferred to keep his own counsel <e> <s> but the house will be glad that he has taken us into his confidence about his thinking so far as it is proper for him to do so today while important consultations are still going on and the commonwealth conference has still to come <e> <s> for my part i hope that the debate will help him and the prime minister in their consultations with the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to interrupt him <e> <s> i did not suggest that it was not timely <e> <s> i suggested that no foreign secretary has ever thought such a debate timely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby asked why his name was put down to follow the name of my noble friend lord barnby <e> <s> i suppose that of all the noble lords in this house none are more totally exposed in their form and more totally opposed in their views than these two and therefore i am inclined to congratulate the usual channels on their placement <e> <s> the noble lord then went on and i listened to him with some interest to give advice to my noble friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> he suggested that the right thing to do would be to go back to the anglo-american plan and be passed a good many strictures on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am against any interference by one country in the internal affairs of another and indeed the founders of the united nations were right to place that at the top of the list of things that arc necessary if there is to be a peaceful world <e> <s> so i condemn interference from south africa or from the soviet union <e> <s> there is no doubt that the soviet union has interfered in africa to a point which makes me very alarmed that the kind of thing they achieved in south-east asia may now happen on the continent of africa <e>", "<cs> my lords a great majority of noble lords will i am sure echo the foreign secretarys hope that there will be an agreement if not this afternoon at least in two or three days time <e> <s> his patience has already been exemplary <e> <s> if there should be a delay of some hours or some days that seems to me to be perfectly reasonable and i have no doubt that the foreign secretary can bear it <e> <s> the difficulty with the policy advocated by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts seems to me to be that it gives a permanent veto to one side <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations and echo the words of the two noble lords opposite and of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> since the commonwealth conference in lusaka this has been a most exemplary exercise in skilful diplomacy and i hope that everything will be well in the end <e> <s> may i ask a question on a matter which i do not think has been mentioned so far <e> <s> how many places of assembly will be available to the patriotic front <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the words spoken by the noble lords lord hatch of lusby and lord gladwyn in the message of sympathy they sent from this house to the noble lord lord ballantrae <e> <s> lady ballantrae was a person who was very talented a personality in her own right <e> <s> many in this country and in new zealand will remember her with respect admiration and affection <e> <s> our thoughts go out to the noble lord very much this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords my first words must be to echo the congratulations which were given by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham to my noble friend lord holderness <e> <s> his thoughtful speech was of course up to the high standard which over the years another place had come to accept <e> <s> i am particularly glad to be following close behind him in this debate because i served with him for quite a time in the foreign office and was able to see his outstanding work in the field of overseas development <e> <s> everywhere he went outside britain his wide sympathies ensured that he was a most effective and a most popular envoy <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear him very often <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and the foreign secretary have both delivered stern strictures so has the noble lord lord stewart of fulham on the soviet military takeover of afghanistan <e> <s> in his admirable speech neither my noble friend who sits behind me nor the foreign secretary exaggerates the possible consequences of that action <e> <s> without any provocation the russian leaders have broken the one rule named in the united nations charter as the touchstone of peace or war <e> <s> they have intervened in the internal affairs of another independent country and they have occupied its territory by force <e> <s> the foreign secretary came very close to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend could help the house with some facts <e> <s> is it a fact that there are some of mr mugabes supporters outside the assembly areas and still with arms <e> <s> if that or something like that number is a fact is it not a direct contravention of the agreement signed in london <e> <s> while the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo the admiration expressed by my noble friend and the other two noble lords for the part played by lord soames and all those associated with the exercise <e> <s> it really has been an exemplary exercise in democratic procedures <e> <s> may i also send good wishes to the new state of zimbabwe <e> <s> my noble friend has noticed as i noticed this morning that the word used by mr mugabe in relation to the future was togetherness <e> <s> if that is in fact the touchstone which he and his government are going to apply to their policies then there is a hope for a multiracial state and a prospering state in the new zimbabweand we must all hope that that will in fact be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must deny myself the pleasure of following the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in his speculation which i think is nice but novel that there were butterflies in pandoras box <e> <s> i have never heard about that one before <e> <s> but during the committee stage i followed with great care the arguments of the noble lord in support of his amendment at that time <e> <s> i must tell him that at that time i would have voted against his amendment <e> <s> i did not think that he made the case that the additional words to the bill were necessary to encourage the independent broadcasting authority to give coverage to international affairs on the new channel <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a point of some substance here and i wonder whether it would be a good thing if the procedure committee had a look at this once more and gave us some guidance <e> <s> it might be a practical suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the right reverend prelate will forgive me i will not follow him in the detail of his speech on the possibilities of helping the developing world <e> <s> he made a powerful argument for free trade with which i agree <e> <s> when monies are scarce as indeed they are it is not possible i think for the governments of the west to do as much as they would like <e> <s> i know exactly where i would deploy the monies available if i had them <e> <s> i would deploy them in agriculture to produce more food for the developing countries and in the infrastructure of communications <e> <s> i remember mr nehru telling me that the mistake he had made in india was premature industrialisation before the agricultural base was firm <e> <s> i think that is a guide which we might follow if and when we are able to increase the funds we are able to deploy in the third world <e>", "<cs> not on the moors <e>", "<cs> i have a colony of bats under the eaves just above a certain room <e> <s> we have found over the years that if we keep about bats <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord melchett having won his case and i would have been in full support of him on the badger is not going to press his luck too far <e> <s> it is one thing when he talks about a licence to take some seals to a zoo and the control of that sort of thing but this is a very controversial subject the culling of seals in particular as he knows and the impact on salmon fisheries and the rivers and i should not like to see that whole subject reopened in this bill <e> <s> a very careful balance has been kept already and i think that paragraph <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will stick to his original position <e> <s> if questions under the conservation of seals act are to be raised i should have to raise the question of the number of seals encouraged by the national trust <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley gave the statistics just now from a comparatively small number to <e> <s> they are causing great problems to the net fishers in the tweed and the forth and to the rod fishers <e> <s> i do not want that controversy to be imported into this bill but it will be if amendments like this are accepted <e> <s> i have every sympathy for the flora and fauna the national trust want to protect but that is not the only question that concerns the fame islands <e> <s> we should have much more controversy if my noble friend gave way to the request of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the approach made by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could help us <e> <s> the secretary of state must ultimately be responsible i understand for issuing licences <e> <s> will they not therefore be issued by a government department rather than an advisory body <e> <s> if that is so one could <e>", "<cs> my lords following the point raised by the noble baroness and recognising the importance of this statement i must say that it has occurred to me in the last months or so that statements have got out of hand <e> <s> there are a great many of them <e> <s> the responses from the two front benches are very long and the back benches following what the noble lord lord shinwell said do their best <e> <s> but even so the whole matter is prolonged for a great deal of time <e> <s> i wonder whether the leader of the house the leader of the opposition and the usual channels could get together and give us some advice because i really think that it is required <e>", "<cs> my lords no two people have done more than my noble friend lord orr-ewing and the noble lord lord chalfont to alert the country to the need to maintain forces and weapons which are necessary to give us security <e> <s> i think those of your lordships who have listened this afternoon to the two debates will realise that we have had a very educative time and that they have given us a lot to think about <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment moved by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> when in the economy of shooting in scotland grouse moors are let and in quite a considerable number of years there are no grouse it makes quite a difference to the tenant who often comes from overseas if he is able to shoot the occasional woodcock and snipe <e> <s> when the noble lord says that the numbers of woodcock are quite small and they may be quite young in august this is not so <e> <s> i suppose that the woodcock is the earliest nester in the united kingdom <e> <s> they nest in march and by august an enormous number of them are well matured <e> <s> most of the woodcock who breed in britain in the united kingdom move comparatively early in september to ireland where they are shot <e> <s> so there is no case for the date for the present season for the woodcock being altered <e>", "<cs> my lords i have actually shot snipe for years consecutively <e> <s> on only two or three occasions have i seen immature snipe in august <e> <s> it is a totally insignificant proportion and certainly not a proportion which justifies altering the present law <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the doubts thrown by mr chapman pincher on the loyalty of the head of the security service were as my right <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion so admirably introduced by my noble friend lord greenhill of harrow is certainly timely because as the foreign secretary has said it anticipates the series of conferences which are to be held later this year when every aspect of the assistance to the developing world will be discussed and at which we hope that new decisions will be taken <e> <s> it may be that some of the suggestions made in your lordships house today including those of the maiden speakers from whose speeches we have benefited will be of value <e>", "<cs> my lords i had some reservations about this amendment which were not dispelled by the speeches which have so far been made <e> <s> i understand lord sandfords objectives very well as he described them <e> <s> it is a comprehensive amendment to try to achieve a balanced rural economy to see that the best argicultural land is used for farming and by and large the worst land is used for forestry <e> <s> that is entirely admirable <e> <s> however when he says in his amendment that directions under this clause shall specify the policies i cannot see how one can do more than specialise in general in other words to appoint where the clause is really meaningless <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will have welcomed the contribution of the most reverend primate and in particular the thoughtfulness with which he has made his contribution to a problem which is human has a high moral content and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a certain amount of confusion in the country about what is actually happening on the ground in the field of disarmament <e> <s> i think i understood my noble friend to tell us about the strategic level and that must be between the soviet union and the united states but is a conference still going on in geneva on conven <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester would not wish to imply that there can be only one view of this bill which is consistent with christian morality <e> <s> that simply is not so <e> <s> i cannot claim to be as good a christian as the right reverend prelate but i may be as good at detecting flaws in the text of an amendment which would have very undesirable effects <e> <s> therefore it is perfectly possible that we in this house as christians can have very many views on the bill <e>", "<cs> i see lord boyd-carpenters purpose in moving this amendment to clause but i can think of special reasons for being selective in relation both to the armed forces and to the foreign service and that case has been made by my noble friend lord belstead <e> <s> they after all have no option they are orderd to go <e> <s> other people whether they are self-employed or whether they are in business can usually exercise some choice these others cannot <e> <s> but the point that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter makes as so vitally important that british personnel are not only ready but eager to do business is i think valid and we should therefore try to remove any obstacle which might make them hesitate so to serve <e>", "<cs> i am attracted by the proposition of the noble lord lord mishcon but we are dealing with cases which will arise years ahead where i do not think one can foresee the circumstances <e> <s> i should not like the secretary of state to be hampered even by some pamphlet which he put out indicating the kind of guidance which he would give <e> <s> on the whole therefore i agree with my noble friend rather than with the noble lord opposite though with some reluctance <e>", "<cs> could he say for example that the individual is not a danger to national security <e> <s> that surely cannot be taken out of the hands of the home secretary and given to any judge to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and gallant lord allow me to ask him to correct one fact about which i think he inadvertently misled the house <e> <s> he spoke as though the per cent <e> <s> increase for five years was a figure snatched out of the air by the government <e> <s> of course it was not <e> <s> it was the figure asked for by the secretary-general of nato and all the allies <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord hughes wants evidence that this is a non-party matter he is shortly going to find it <e> <s> i do not believe that i have disagreed even in a shade of opinion with my noble friend lord boyd of merton in our political lives in over years but this afternoon the position of the gibraltarians and this has been confirmed by what my noble friend the leader of the house said this afternoon it is that they have an absolute right of entry into this country <e>", "<cs> i am not sure about the advice given to the committee by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> he can correct me if i am wrong but i believe that if we were to amend the bill in the way proposed we should lose the bill until the autumn session it would have to go back to the commons <e>", "<cs> that is a technical reason why i should think it would be unwise to press the amendment now <e> <s> but it is on the merits of the matter that i feel that the arrangement between the minister of state and the prime minister of belize is better than the amendment which as i understand it would commit the british government to support belize with military forces in perpetuity whatever arrangements might be made in the meantime by countries which border on belize for belizes security <e> <s> again at a later stage we should have to amend the bill i take it if any other arrangements were made <e> <s> i prefer the agreement made between the minister in this country and the prime minister of belize which i believe will serve the interests of belize rather better than something more rigid such as the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord shepherd is right when he says that this matter has behind it a very long history of negotiations <e> <s> we have never been able to come to an agreement before now as to how independence should be approached <e> <s> the government have succeeded in doing this with the guatemalan ministers <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i have already said about the merits of the case and the demerits of this particular amendment but on the question of the bill going back to another place let me suppose that the bill has to be reintroduced in october or it might be delayed in order to take the remaining stages <e> <s> i would hesitate to accept that responsibility i must say <e> <s> there have taken place successful negotiations which no one has previously been able to achieve <e> <s> it is a pretty tricky situation and sending back the bill to another place for another three months or so would be to accept a very heavy responsibility which i would not care to undertake <e>", "<cs> of course that can be done under the ministers formula <e> <s> we are to protect them for an appropriate period which presumably means a period to be agreed between the two governments in the light of outside events <e>", "<cs> i have never before spoken so much in my life on one morning and i hope never to again but the issue here has been rather side-tracked by the procedure i think <e> <s> the issue here is whether we can give an open-ended commitment in this case <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord shinwell that this is really undesirable <e> <s> i think this is the centre of the issue and that the agreement made between the ministers of our two countries is really preferable to that <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord pitt moved all three amendments together may i <e>", "<cs> i would not dare challenge my noble friend on the law but i thought that if you left out subsection probably something else ought to be put in dealing with security but i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords those of your lordships who are interested in the atlantic salmon and scottish fisheries and indeed that interest of course spreads further afield will be greatly indebted to the noble viscount for marshalling the facts which illustrate so clearly the steep decline in the numbers of salmon that have entered scottish rivers in recent years to which i would add that the average weight of salmon caught has also steeply declined <e>", "<cs> my lords the anxiety which prompted my noble friend lord kimberley to put his motion on the order paper is certainly soundly based in history <e> <s> twice in this century it has been proved that faced with a powerful and offensive enemy it required the combined strength of europe and america to contain and defeat aggression one or the other could not have done it and one or the other could not do it now <e> <s> that is why nato was formed and the joint obligation was underwritten to defend the continent and the atlantic ocean <e> <s> defence on that scale cannot be improvised <e>", "<cs> the noble earl kicked pretty hard <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name on the list of speakers but i had missed that this short debate was taking place <e> <s> the noble viscount lord simon reminded us at the start of the debt of honour that we owe to the poles <e> <s> i am particularly conscious of that <e> <s> we had at home during the war the polish division quartered upon us and never once did i hear one of those gallant men complain of the fate which was theirs <e> <s> their sole concern was to fight the germans <e> <s> i remember too the feeling of helplessness when i took part in the yalta debate in the house of commons after the war <e>", "<cs> not guilty my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us have shared in the luck of my noble friend lady elliot in being successful in the draw for this debate and we are grateful for it <e> <s> the only trouble when one follows my noble friend in her own pet subject of agriculture is that there is virtually nothing left to be said <e> <s> the noble viscount lord thurso said it all with almost <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those which have been expressed to the noble lord lord shaughnessy on the admirable speech that he made to us today <e> <s> i do not know whether he realises how refreshing it is to hear one of her majestys subjects from canada coming and speaking to us in this house <e> <s> incidentally the only french i remember hearing in either house of parliament here is <e>", "<cs> i understood from the noble lord lord stewart of fulham that he wants us to impress upon the canadian people two principles <e> <s> the first is that the ownership of property should not be changed without the due processes of law <e> <s> the second is that there should be proper compensation if property is taken over <e> <s> i recall rather wryly that all my political life i have been trying to impress those principles on the socialist party in this country <e> <s> i can only say i am very glad that they have been converted <e> <s> but i hope we shall not feel that parliament should lecture the people of canada on these principles they i think understand them as well as we do <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord shackleton has said we in this country have lived for many years with the situation in which we knew that if the argentine were to mobilise her full strength and to attack the falkland islands no garrison short of brigade strength or more could hold the situation <e> <s> nor could any naval force unless a major one have prevented that invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation in the south atlantic is bound to change from week to week and day to day certain things will happen from time to time which will be unsettling to public opinion and the public may well be confused <e> <s> therefore i welcome very much the statements constantly made by the foreign secretary and repeated in the statement today of the position in international law <e> <s> there are three matters which seem to me to be constant as of today that the argentinian occupation of the falkland islands is illegal and people should understand that that they have been ordered to withdraw from the islands by the security council which is the world authority that they have not done so and that as long as they have not done so the british government are entitled to try in any way they can to see that the people of the falkland islands are released from this occupation <e> <s> i think if we can remember those three things all through this very unsettling period in which we are going to be then we shall be steadfast and we shall be able to judge the day-to-day events in proper perspective <e> <s> we shall go on in a moment i am afraid i have to leave talking about the casualties but i think it is worth <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement repeated by the noble baroness the leader of the house will have given universal satisfaction confirming as it has the total surrender of the argentine forces proud satisfaction as the noble lord lord shackleton has said at the achievement of our services <e> <s> i think we are in this situation because the prime minister and the government in very difficult circumstances gave a decisive lead because the country did not lose its nerve and because our armed forces carried out their tasks according to the highest traditions of all the services <e> <s> we have been able to prove what we said at the start that we in this country will not allow aggression to pay whenever we have a chance to thwart it <e>", "<cs> not as a noble earl i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not putting my name on the list of speakers but i was not sure that i could be here <e> <s> perhaps i may make a comment or two <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister and my right honourable friend mr buchanan-smith have both showed great patience tenacity and skill over many years and it is very satisfactory that they have been able to come to this conclusion <e> <s> the best part of this agreement almost is the conservation side <e> <s> there has been anxiety in scotland amongst scottish fishermen for the future of the fishing industry and this will give them some reassurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the congratulations which have been given by the right reverend prelate to the noble lord lord maclehose of beoch <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure for me to follow that because for many years i had the privilege of seeing him operating in his professional field <e> <s> he has been one of the great administrators as everyone in hong kong of all races will testify <e> <s> all through his career his judgments have been acute and his counsels wise <e> <s> we are very lucky in this house that in future we shall be able to draw upon his wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the forgiveness of the leader of the house and in particular the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> months ago i made an arrangement to be outside this house this evening and i am afraid i cannot break it and i must ask for their understanding <e> <s> i do not think i have ever been guilty before in this connection i hope i shall not be guilty again <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of cases in which grants are made both from her majestys government and from the european community particularly in the field of agriculture as my noble friend will know <e> <s> is it the general practice that when a european grant is made supplementary to the grant given by her majestys government there then is a reduction <e> <s> when the noble lord answers the noble lord lord ross i wonder whether he could circulate the answer to that question a little more widely <e>", "<cs> my lords when grants and services had to be cut for everybody in this country it was scarcely realistic to be able to hope that foreign students could be exempt <e> <s> but as one who has been very much concerned with this matter in the past and very keen on grants to foreign students may i say how very satisfactory it is that the foreign secretary has been able to release these substantial funds <e> <s> i welcome this wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord carrington has deployed with such clarity the reasons why nato has adopted a policy of deterrence pending multilateral disarmament and exposed with such clinical precision the fallacies in the belief that the soviet union can be disarmed by example that i need not cover any of that ground again <e> <s> i shall be content with three reflections <e> <s> the first concerns british weaponry so long as military confrontation exists the second is a reflection on the no-first-use formula for reducing tension and the third some of my feelings as a layman about the moral content in the nuclear debate <e> <s> it will be a sad day when the church does not speak out in this house <e> <s> happily there is no danger of that as far as i can see while the right reverend prelate and his colleagues occupy those benches and often may we hear the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember the day when sir peter first took office as clerk of the parliaments <e> <s> i would add a few words of gratitude for the unfailing kindness he showed to me all through the years and to every member of this house <e> <s> he has served parliament and this house with total loyalty and i am old-fashioned enough to believe that loyalty is still one of the greatest of the virtues <e> <s> i should like to add my good wishes to him and to lady henderson <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos i am glad that the usual channels were able to arrange this debate <e> <s> in a situation where the leading members of a commonwealth government had been murdered where the internal political differences in the island of grenada were inflamed by the presence of foreign mercenaries and where two countries barbados and jamaica judged the danger to be so acute in the context of caribbean security that they were ready to provide troops themselves for an expedition and called on the americans to restore law and order and sovereignty then it is of an abnormality and of an enormity which requires that parliament must take notice <e> <s> parliament must learn the many lessons that there are to be learned from the many aspects of the case <e>", "<cs> no my lords not for the moment <e> <s> there is another case to which i will refer a little later if the noble lord does not mind and that is the british troops in the lebanon <e> <s> they are not there under any international cover at all they are simply there because the french the italians ourselves and the united states considered that unless we intervened lebanon would cease to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e> <s> the noble lord underlines my point <e> <s> we had transferred <e>", "<cs> my lords if by referring to some other government and at some other time the noble lord is thinking of the government which followed the government of which the noble lord was a member that government did exactly the same as his <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends statement was necessarily very concerned with financial and economic matters <e> <s> is it not the political cohesion of europe which will matter supremely in the critical months and years ahead when europes reconciling diplomacy may make all the difference between war and peace <e> <s> therefore can my noble friend give the house the assurance that the prime minister and the foreign secretary will urge their colleagues to deal with these economic matters speedily so that time is not lost <e> <s> for when time is lost i am afraid the political influence of europe will correspondingly decline <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is talking about the channel lasting all day as it does in the united nations in new york which is much the most satisfactory way of broadcasting an assembly <e> <s> is the main objection to that the cost <e>", "<cs> a number of us might have attempted to speak but i understand that the noble lord has withdrawn the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord paget of northampton for the kind words he directed towards me at the start of what he had to say <e> <s> i would return the compliment by saying that although he is not the most conventional of politicians i have enjoyed him thoroughly all my life in both houses of parliament <e> <s> during the whole of a long political life i have noticed that the noble lord is always impatient of unreality and pretence <e> <s> he put down his question because he felt the unreality of independent small countries which have none of the traditional attributes economic military or political to sustain that status <e> <s> then there is the pretence such countries do exist and i think they will be recognised for quite a long time ahead that there is some valid code of international law to which these countries must subscribe and on which they should rely for their protection <e> <s> i have a good deal of sympathy with his approach for to connive at pretence in international affairs can be very dangerous <e>", "<cs> i probably should declare an interest <e> <s> for countless years i was either a landowner or the chairman of a private land-owning company <e> <s> in those years i have seen all sorts of dealings with all sorts of public corporations electricity gas coal oil trunk roads many of them seeking wayleaves or facilities for development <e> <s> as the noble lord lord howard has said until now in every case the landowner was notified and the landowner had the rights which the noble lord described <e> <s> quite often as was natural the original proposals made by one of these corporations cut across the development plans for the estate <e> <s> however as a matter of practice over all those years i cannot recall a single case out of dozens in which a settlement was not reached to the satisfaction of the corporation the landowner and the tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the welcome given by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and by my noble friend lady young to the earl of stockton <e> <s> the house will understand that after some years i am a little bit rusty on the title the dignity and honour of an earl <e> <s> but this i do know that my noble friend has built up a bank of knowledge and wisdom on which this house will be very happy to draw <e> <s> i hope that he addresses us on many an occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i did not misrepresent or misunderstand the noble lord on that <e> <s> i would agree of course that these contacts should be made <e> <s> it is the results about which i am a bit sceptical in the short term <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that i am sure that the course of action proposed by my noble friend and to which he has committed the government is far better than trying to include these matters of interception in the telecommunications bill <e> <s> i listened carefully to the speeches of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies the other day and to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and i came to the conclusion that these matters would be far better dealt with in a separate bill <e> <s> i have no doubt that we can and will pay the same scrupulous attention to national security when we come to that bill as we have tried to do in this bill <e> <s> i have in my time known two governments virtually wreck their secret services by attempts at open government and we cannot afford anything like that in this country <e> <s> i am sure that my noble and learned friends would agree that this is a wise point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for my noble friend the leader of the house to arrange a special meeting of the usual channels on this particular matter <e> <s> i think that the situation is becoming very serious and it is difficult to regain the thread of a debate after so many interruptions <e> <s> was it not the practice in the past that after a statement was repeated noble lords on the front benches asked let us say two questions and back-benchers exercised great restraint <e> <s> they did that because if the matter was really important the remedy was to debate it at some future date <e> <s> would it not be possible for the usual channels to give us fresh guidance in the light of what used to happen in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join those who have expressed their gratitude to my noble friend lord sudeley for the thoughful manner in which he has moved the second reading of his bill <e> <s> i confess that when in the past the fur has begun to fly on liturgical matters my instinct has been to take cover <e> <s> i am not ashamed of that reaction <e> <s> in history so much damage has been done by dogma and doctrine has been responsible for so much human misery that it is high time for tolerance <e> <s> above all i wish reason and common sense to prevail in my own church and in all the churches and in particular between the state and the church <e> <s> in this particular case when we are discussing the use of the prayer book of i see no reason for conflict <e> <s> that opinion is reinforced by the speech of the most reverend primate which we have had the privilege of listening to tonight in which authoritatively and with definition he has given guidance to the clergy about the use of the prayer book <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in agreement with the amendment of the noble lady but i must tell the house that i would feel unable to vote for it because if it were passed it would be of considerable financial gain to me and i do not feel entitled to vote in such circumstances <e> <s> i do not imagine that the government are able to accept the amendment but i wonder whether i may suggest something else <e> <s> when one was able to make some money from grouse shooting no-one minded being rated to some extent but now over wide areas of scotland there are no grouse left at all or virtually none <e> <s> the owner is therefore put in the position that if he lets to tenants he is probably destroying his stock on his moor <e> <s> so we are rated exactly the same as we were years ago <e> <s> why cannot the assessors be told that they should take into account the size of the bag when they are putting forward their rating proposals <e> <s> i think that would be fair and it would be done without legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend made it clear that this country was not in a minority of one <e> <s> after all the council of ministers at the prime ministers level were unanimous in the recommendation that they made <e> <s> however could i ask my noble friend one question on the procedure <e> <s> am i right in thinking that while the parliament can delay they cannot override a decision of the council of ministers <e> <s> could my noble friend possibly say <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i can remember as far back as and a famous secretary-general of the communist internationale giving instructions as to how to recruit people into the russian peace organisations <e> <s> his words i remember were one sympathiser a writer of reputation or a retired general is worth more than poor devils who know no better <e>", "<cs> my lords having worked over many years in commonwealth circles with mr nehru and then with mrs gandhi i should like to add my own words of revulsion at this horrible crime which as the prime minister said has deprived india of its great leader and the commonwealth of an outstanding personality <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond at once to the substance of the amendment by the noble lord lord chalfont which poses the questions which i think are near constitutional as to whether one house of parliament should be televised before the other or whether one should be televised separately from the other or without the other my answer to that immediately is no <e> <s> i think that that would be unthinkable <e> <s> so in this debate i am concerned with the experiment in television in this house and i do not intend therefore to register my vote on any amendment <e> <s> but at a later date should we have to take a final decision on this matter i should vote for the noble lords amendment without question <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was at the foreign office mr norris was an effective and very loyal member of the service and i should like to be associated if i may with the messages of sympathy sent from this house to mrs norris and to her family <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady young at the start of this debate anticipated that we should have an interesting discussion <e> <s> she will not have been disappointed because we have had the benefit of the mature judgment of such noble lords as the noble lord lord rhodes the noble lord lord maclehose and many others who know china or hong kong <e> <s> we have benefited too from the maiden speech of my noble friend lord birkenhead <e> <s> i remember sitting on the steps of the throne my father introduced me once when his grandfather was speaking in this house on the subject of allowing peeresses in their own right onto these benches <e> <s> he was emphatically negative and immensely amusing <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl himself will widen his interests and talk to us about all kinds of things in the future years <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to agree with the advice of the advisory committee and of the minister <e> <s> i think the anxiety here is that if we do not have some permissive form in the bill the name museum of scotland will gradually fall out of the picture and indeed as i understand it it will need legislation <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm whether or not the change of name will need legislation in the future <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords while echoing my noble friends words about the prime ministers speech and admiration of it may i ask him whether he agrees that the prime minister and the president particularly the latter established something of real significance in terms of the disarmament negotiations about to proceed in other words that the star wars research would continue but that before testing and before deployment the results would be used in negotiation with the soviet union <e> <s> it seems to me that to have established that is of considerable significance <e>", "<cs> i should like to clarify matters in my own mind if not in the mind of anyone else on this amendment <e> <s> the concept if i may use the word of a great many of us is that the museums of scotland as they are now known will gradually at some future time be turned into the museum of scotland <e> <s> we have established i believe that this does not require legislation in other words that the trustees can do it <e> <s> we have progressed so far <e> <s> the question now perhaps arises that at some future stage of the bill it might be possible to forecast that this should be done by using the phrase museum of scotland in the bill <e> <s> i am not sure that one can forecast in a bill in that way <e> <s> there are great difficulties in doing so <e> <s> nevertheless i suggest that we wait until another stage for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is with respect an intervention which i can ignore <e>", "<cs> my lords i have therefore spoken in the past and the present but i want to ask the question as to whether we can expect improvement in the future <e> <s> in the past we have been dealing with the prototype of a communist state the ideology of which has permeated its foreign policy which aimed at the promotion of communism outside russian borders and was ready on occasion to use force at first or second hand to achieve a political end <e> <s> some argue that the idealism in the original communist conception was corrupted by stalin in his crude ambitions for power and empire <e> <s> there may be an element of truth in that diagnosis <e>", "<cs> my lords it merely remains for me to express my gratitude to all the noble lords on all sides of the house who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn the leader of the opposition for taking so much trouble with a speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i had to be absent at the previous stages of this bill <e> <s> therefore i am obviously more ignorant than i should be <e> <s> for the record i wonder whether my noble friend lady elles or the minister can help me <e> <s> representa-tions have been made to me that if my noble friends amendment is carried nato employees would find themselves at a disadvantage <e> <s> am i right in thinking that because nato officials are employed directly by her majestys government their position will not be at all adversely affected by this amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend or the minister can help me on that matter i shall be grateful <e>", "<cs> i should have been content to remain silent during the whole committee stage of this bill were it not that my noble friend lord molson for the second time during committee stage has designed an amendment which would conflict with the central purpose of the bill <e> <s> i am not concerned with whether we call it an overall authority or joint authority or whether it is elected or appointed though i am bound to say that if we are to have one i should prefer the former <e> <s> but this surely runs counter to the intention of the government which is that there shall be no overall body for london or the metropolitan areas <e> <s> as my noble friend says this amendment quite simply proposes that there shall be <e> <s> in this committee we have for many years accepted that when another place passed with a majority a bill to which this chamber of parliament has given a second reading it is not desirable to use the committee stage to reopen matters of principle <e> <s> i believe this amendment in fact is doing just that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for one minute <e> <s> i do not necessarily dissent from much of what he is saying <e> <s> however i am bound to say that one would not get the impression from his speech that the same kind of research has been carried on by the russians for many years and that they are still going on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that if the noble lord had not put it into my head it would never have occurred to me to raise the question of the propriety of this amendment in the context in which he has spoken just now <e> <s> it does not repeat in detail anything that has happened on report nor does it offend against the principle of the bill <e> <s> thus this has rather been dragged in <e> <s> nonetheless the other day i raised this in committee in respect of an amendment tabled by my noble friend lord molson <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has kindly chosen to follow up what i said i do not of course mean that there was any obstruction of the bill on the opposition benches <e> <s> i do not think as a matter of fact that if the rules of the other place had been applied the two amendments moved by the noble lord lord barnett and by the noble lord lord diamond would have got past the table <e> <s> they would have done so in this house of course <e> <s> as the noble lord lord shackleton has said there are no restrictions <e> <s> i just do not think that if we had had the commons practice which i am not necessarily advocating those two amendments would have been allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be impossible to imagine two points of view on matters of national security and defence which are further apart <e>", "<cs> my lords we must hope for favourable developments so far as south africa is concerned over the next six months <e> <s> however will her majestys ministers recognise that if the economic sanctions were successful against south africa that would be the quickest way to ruin the economies of swaziland basutoland mozambique and namibia with severe economic repercussions further afield <e> <s> could that make any contribution to the development of the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always agreeable to follow the noble lord lord gladwyn but particularly so today when i recall his very distinguished service to this country in the early and formative days of the united nations both in the security council and in the assembly <e> <s> incidentally i remember that the noble lord made himself into a television star overnight <e> <s> it was a very impressive performance as we watched it from far away <e>", "<cs> my lords as a simple ex-foreign minister perhaps i may be allowed to add my welcome to this order if only for the reason that as nasco is to be located in edinburgh it will be a constant reminder to us of the value of the atlantic salmon to the scottish rural economy <e> <s> it will also be a reminder that unless we can arrest the marked decline in the number of salmon coming into the scottish rivers to breed we shall lose a very valuable asset <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend saved me from having to ask one of the questions that i was going to ask when he said that the russians are pursuing exactly the same lines of research as the united states is pursuing now <e> <s> has not the offer been made by president reagan to share the acquired american knowledge with the soviet union should they wish to do so and to examine the case whether sdi might not be of mutual advantage therefore to both <e> <s> could not this sharing of knowledge be injected into the geneva conference should the russians agree <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular pleasure for me to follow my noble friend lord biddulph <e> <s> we are neighbours on the same river the tweed <e> <s> luckily for me i am downstream of him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is trying to be most scrupulously fair but has he mentioned the fact that the netting at night will be reduced by eight hours a night <e>", "<cs> well that is not bad <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend the minister will be able to clarify clause for the benefit of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i equally hope because my reading of these clauses is that they will not solve the problem of management that they will enable the river and the district boards to improve on the present situation a good deal <e> <s> in a year or twos time after experience we may be able to improve on that and i hope my noble friend will not press his motion on this clause <e> <s> i hope equally the minister will help the noble lord lord ross of marnock to understand it <e>", "<cs> i have listened to all the discussion and i would wish only to reinforce the warning given by the noble lord lord ross of marnock that whatever solution is decided upon by the secretary of state these matters should not come to parliament <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord moran or perhaps the minister can help on this whether if his amendment is passed it would mean altering the long title of the bill <e> <s> i think when we come to a later stage on the licensing of dealers in england it would be necessary that we should do so at the appropriate time <e> <s> indeed he has an amendment to do this <e> <s> i want to make it clear now that if it is necessary to do this we would do so in this house as i think it cannot be done in another place <e>", "<cs> if we were to consider any sort of control of rod fishing at low water to compensate so to speak for any control put on the net fishing i would much rather see it done by regulating the lure or the bait <e> <s> after all the fellow is skilful who catches a fish at all with a fly <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord ross of marnock is being fairly unreasonable <e> <s> there are strong indications in clause as to what kind of measures will be taken <e> <s> my noble friend cannot say exactly what they will be at this moment but the indications are pretty well there <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord not to debunk this clause because if he is going to move a clause tomorrow as he has just indicated that this should apply to england and wales he had better be a little bit careful before he devalues it too far <e>", "<cs> i am trying to help the noble lord tomorrow <e> <s> he is making it more difficult for me <e>", "<cs> i shall not repeat the arguments used by the noble lord lord ross of marnock with all of which i agree and i hope that the minister will give very serious consideration to this amendment or something very like it <e> <s> the government can have no objection in principle after all because they have proposed licensing in scotland <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure if i have understood what my noble and learned friend has said <e> <s> has he in effect said that salmon in the back of a car is a sufficient reason for suspicion that on that suspicion a prosecution can be brought but from that moment the onus of proof is on the defendant <e> <s> i have no doubt that i have over-simplified everything but is that roughly so <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce that point and to ask my noble friend the minister to look at the words of the existing act which has been quoted by my noble friend lord trenchard <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> if the noble marquess were to press his amendments i should have to find myself in the opposite lobby and for that i shall give <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord burton though i take a slightly different view i rather wonder whether my noble friend lord lansdowne has forgotten that there is another stage to this bill and that it might be a good thing between now and then to see what has been said today <e> <s> then we can put down an amendment to the phrasing to make it a little different from the wording so far <e>", "<cs> if the cart is before the horse which i can see is possible i take it that there would be no objection perhaps we could be helped by the chair to putting down the same amendment at the report stage <e> <s> i do not want it to go because if we are going to alter the long title it has to be done in this house <e> <s> we do not want to miss the only opportunity we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lady cox feels rewarded <e> <s> her motion which she so admirably introduced has led to one of the best informed debates that i have heard in this house and that is saying quite a lot <e> <s> it has attracted speakers of real authority with knowledge and experience <e> <s> one cannot often say of a debate that nearly every speech and this is true of speeches from all sides of the house will be worth reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i would be in favour of this amendment in certain conditions <e> <s> we were talking about it before in relation to very low water when nets and rods might reasonably be expected to alter the methods of fishing <e> <s> this i think applies to the river at all times the river board ought to be able to intervene and let us say order that bait of any kind should not be used <e> <s> this i think could have a pretty serious effect on tenants taking fishing they might find themselves in great difficulty <e> <s> i should like to hear my noble friends reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not present in the chamber and so he is unable to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters which involve the possible interpretation of words in the statute by the court make it very difficult for the non-lawyer <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning is clearly worried at the prospect that the wording we are talking about now as applied to scotland would involve proving the state of a mans mind <e> <s> that is a very difficult if not impossible thing to do <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate unless i have him wrong suggests that the words of the bill are adequate because it is possible to infer the state of a mans mind from first the facts as they present <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say a few words by leave of the house because we may make only one speech on each amendment <e> <s> i listened to my noble friend lord gray but i was not one of those who had the advantage of hearing the lord advocate in private although i heard him in committee <e> <s> i was not entirely convinced by him but when we come to these scottish clauses i think we have to accept the lord advocates opinion on scottish law <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord can let us talk about these matters again on third reading that would be fine as far as i am concerned but it might inconvenience the house and perhaps be better to come to a decision now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that on all sides of the house we are enormously grateful to the minister for taking so much trouble on this issue <e> <s> there was too big a hole in the bill to leave unstopped and he has moved to help us a great deal <e> <s> i wish to express my gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand this we would first have three years in which regulations restricting drift netting are in force and applied <e> <s> that is i believe a good start <e> <s> during those three years i hope that the government will collect statistics and that the results will be reported to both houses of parliament <e> <s> i believe that this is the ministers intention <e> <s> i must say however that i am attracted by the proposal of the noble lord lord moran that some words should be added to the bill pointing to the purpose of designing a policy of conservation of salmon that applies to the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> that should be the objective after we have collected all the statistics and have all the knowledge of what has hapened in the three years <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord moran decides what he wishes to do on his amendment may i ask whether i heard my noble friend aright <e> <s> did he say that he was going to look for words to express the objective of a conservation policy for the united kingdom eventually <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> i think that i was probably guilty last year according to the ruling that the lord chairman of committees now reads out <e> <s> there was a dilemma <e> <s> i did not want to be provocative on russias practices <e> <s> if i moved a resolution it seemed to me that there was a danger that the debate would become difficult and controversial <e> <s> i therefore deliberately chose a motion and deliberately made my motion for papers as innocuous as i could make it and got away with it <e> <s> i of course support the lord chairmans ruling now <e> <s> however i think that with a little ingenuity we can probably still have put down as a motion matters which are comparatively non-controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords to be sandwiched between my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and the noble and learned lord lord denning is not a very enviable position particularly when part of the disputation is the difference between scottish and english law <e> <s> i do not feel that at this stage i can add very many words to the argument that has already taken place in committee and at report stage and the words that we have heard from my noble friend lord trenchard this afternoon <e> <s> i think i can understand the lord advocates insistence that there is a principle of law inolved namely that the individual brought to court must have the chance to convince the court if he can that he did not believe that there were no circumstances in which it would have been reasonable for him to suspect that he had obtained the salmon in his possession from an unlicensed source <e>", "<cs> my lords in talking about the international reaction to these events can my noble friend say whether there has been any reaction from the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords may all the back-benchers be allowed to associate themselves with the front-benchers on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords there is to be a debate and so i shall be content to make two reflections on this situation <e> <s> the first and i am sure that the noble baroness will be content with what my noble friend has said on this matter is that the evidence is conclusive that we are dealing with international terrorism organised by a sovereign state against other members of the united nations <e> <s> that is a new and a very serious and very dangerous situation <e> <s> if such a situation is allowed to continue unchecked then there will be military responses from one country or another provoked beyond endurance <e> <s> then it will be impossible to allocate blame and i cannot allocate blame to the united states on this occasion <e> <s> there must be a better way found than military response to terrorist situations <e>", "<cs> my lords europe and the united states and others interested in law and order must meet urgently and give leadership to the world on this matter <e> <s> i do not believe that that can be done <e>", "<cs> when on th february my noble friend lady cox moved her motion on political indoctrination in the schools i think the house concluded on the whole that she had made her case <e> <s> there are certain education authorities which deliberately plan to undermine the basic values on which our democracy is built and there are certain teachers who distort the facts and teach history according to their personal bias <e> <s> when my noble friend lord tonypandy asks whether there is a problem the answer must be yes there is a problem of indoctrination in the schools <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend help us before we leave this matter <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend lady cox will decide but what i am trying to get is sympathy for and understanding of the fact that politics when taught in schools must be taught with objectivity and without political bias <e> <s> i think on both sides of the committee we are looking for words to express that which can be put into the bill <e> <s> if my noble friend can give some indication that he will look at that conception sympathetically i think we shall go away happier than we are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend remind the house of this am i not right in thinking that the hostages were kidnapped almost a month ago <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the leader of the house began his speech today by reminding us that if there were any doubts before that the government of libya were organising acts of terror on the international stage those doubts must have been dispelled first by the hard evidence given by the prime minister to another place and secondly by the ostentatious claim of colonel gaddafi that he feels entitled to export revolution and in that process to kill <e> <s> that is the new matter with which we have to deal <e> <s> it is state terrorism and with all due respect to the most reverend primate i do not see how you can spell that except with a capital t <e> <s> it is surely a very dangerous doctrine to try to suggest that political grievance can in any circumstance be justified by an act of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the fact that with regret i could not be present for fridays debate <e> <s> however having read it all i notice that time and again the valid point was made that if there was to be a settlement of the trouble in south africa it must be made in africa by africans and for africans <e> <s> that is not the only role which the foreign secretary can play to help that process along <e> <s> i am glad that he is visiting zimbabwe and zambia but is it not worth taking a lot of time and great <e>", "<cs> my lords during the years in which i was in the foreign and commonwealth office there were continual contacts with these governments on the question of immigration <e> <s> it was the one question on which they would never co-operate and never had any sympathy for our desire to limit the numbers <e> <s> we told them constantly that it would make social conditions impossible here if we took too many <e> <s> so there was consultation and contact all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord thorneycroft always speaks with authority on matters of national and international security <e> <s> today he has given the house a clear and careful analysis of the armament situation as he put it in the real world as it is now and the reasons which have led him to conclude that the nuclear element is still necessary in the armoury of the nato alliance to which the british polaris submarines are assigned now and to which trident will be allotted in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships who have sat through this debate will agree that we have had an extraordinarily interesting afternoon <e> <s> as each one of your lordships has testified <e> <s> the noble and gallant lord lord bramall gave us a splendid start <e> <s> but each contribution has been of the highest quality and i was most impressed by the very careful judgments which each noble lord made on the two halves of the motion as they were presented the relationship between the united states and this country and between europe i take that correction and the united states and the possibilities that might be opened up for the prime ministers visit to moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to add my voice to those who have welcomed the prime ministers visit <e> <s> it was clearly a very remarkable achievement <e> <s> she has opened up a close relationship with mr gorbachev which will clearly be followed up and it augurs very well i think for future meetings <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my noble friend lord perth has raised this question of the importance of students and particularly of overseas students to the scottish universities <e> <s> let me take just one example <e> <s> there has been a long tradition and tradition is important of contacts between norway and heriot watt university over many years <e> <s> they have been greatly valued by both countries and a number of norwegian students have come here <e> <s> i should not like to see that relationship upset <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl lord perth will allow me to intervene he will remember that i asked my noble friend to take plenty of time <e> <s> so many good suggestions have been made that they ought to be considered <e> <s> my noble friend has heard them for the first time and i think it is reasonable now that he should be given until the report stage to tell us what further thoughts he has had <e>", "<cs> the difficulty arises that if the noble earl were to divide the committee he would be dividing it on a specific amendment and i with a number of my noble friends might not necessarily think that amendment was right <e> <s> there could be an alternative proposal which my noble friend might hit on and which might be a great deal better <e> <s> i do not want to commit myself at this moment <e>", "<cs> i can understand why my noble friend the minister is reluctant to extend what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has called the principle of exemption <e> <s> i think it is difficult for him <e> <s> however this problem must be dealt with <e> <s> severely disabled people must be helped in some way <e> <s> i should be perfectly happy as is the noble lord lord swinfen to see this matter dealt with by rebate <e> <s> i think i prefer that method <e>", "<cs> not yet <e>", "<cs> please remind me <e>", "<cs> my lords dealing with amendment no <e> <s> like my noble friend the earl of perth i was concerned at committee stage lest the payment required of students in the form of a community charge might discourage students especially overseas students from coming to scottish universities <e> <s> the proposal which my noble friend has now made is as i understand it that no student shall be charged more than per cent <e> <s> of the community charge <e> <s> that while it preserves the important principle upon which the government have insisted during the passage of the bill that all who use services should pay a certain amount towards them is also entirely reasonable in relation to the student <e> <s> i cannot see any student faced with a per cent <e> <s> charge could possibly find it too difficult to cope with that <e>", "<cs> my lords when the time for debate is rationed there is little scope for the customary courtesies but i must compliment the noble lord lord cledwyn on his immaculate sense of timing <e> <s> he has chosen the only day since the last war on which this house has been able to congratulate the two great powers on an agreement on physical reduction of nuclear arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord morton of shuna will recognise that when the speaking ration is five minutes the usual compliments have to go by the board <e> <s> but i can i hope within reason convince him because all my life i have been a supporter of decentralisation in government and in administration <e> <s> that has always been a part of my political philosophy an instinct which was very much reinforced during the years or so when it seemed that his party might be successful in installing in this country the nationalisation of the means of production distribution and exchange <e> <s> that would have involved a concentration of power totally unacceptable to england scotland or wales and happily the electorate has agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wish to amplify one of the points so admirably covered by my noble friend lord moran <e> <s> your lordships will remember that those who were interested in measures to conserve the stocks of atlantic salmon had to wait for many years to persuade governments to legislate <e> <s> the act when it came was modest but useful provided that its provisions were actively applied <e> <s> it is to that point that i should like to address my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the tributes to australia ought to end without a mention

friend aware that this was the most debasing and degrading programme that it is possible to imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords i started looking at the programme and thought that it must be fiction although of the most deplorable kind but as one went through it it appeared that it was directly related to the american forces serving in this country and there was no mistaking that aim <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend and the government will make some representations to the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord callaghan of cardiff said at the start of his speech that he had concluded this morning having read all the speeches of yesterday that there was nothing more to be said <e> <s> happily he recovered early in the afternoon and we enjoyed his contribution <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister was listening intently when he talked about the importance of adult education <e> <s> i believe that that subject has been mentioned too seldom until now in this debate <e>", "<cs> i believe that the whole committee will have listened to the speech of the most reverend primate with relief <e> <s> surely i am not alone in greatly admiring the diligence with which my noble friend lady cox has sought to find words to express our wishes in the bill <e> <s> i believe that to be important <e> <s> it is the wish of a number of your lordships that the story of christianity and the values which derive directly from christianity should be taught in our schools <e>", "<cs> i shall only speak for a moment <e> <s> if this amendment is taken to a vote i should have to vote for it because the issue cannot be shirked <e> <s> but i am bound to confess that i would far rather that we gave the right reverend prelate a little more time until report in order to achieve what will be i hope a double of the use of the word christian both in relation to christian teaching in the schools and in relation to christian collective worship <e> <s> that is my position <e> <s> but let us not put off the matter <e> <s> it must be settled and settled soon <e>", "<cs> i accept the principle of privatisation of the steel industry and i do not wish to see that principle substantially diluted or obstacles created in the path of the bills application <e> <s> however i understand the anxieties of the noble earl lord perth taking into account the precedents of which he has spoken especially the british sugar corporation <e> <s> that is a precedent which we should certainly consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not be guilty of turning this debate into a debate on the re-education of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i think that he has gone too far for that and i shall not try it <e> <s> i should like him to know that from the start of this series of debates my concern has been that the story of christianity should be told to the children because i do not believe that one can understand the nature of our country unless that story is told and unless it is known <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is probably only one answer to this question <e> <s> my noble friend lord thorneycroft possibly puts a different interpretation on the words in the main than does the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i see no other way except to have more talks and have them quickly and hope that we can have some adjustment of the amendment if the right reverend prelate can accept this on third reading <e> <s> it is a difficult position because time is so short but i think that more talks is the only answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for presenting this motion with his usual courtesy and clarity <e> <s> there is one point to which i should like to respond immediately and with satisfaction <e> <s> the noble earl stated his premise that the united kingdom parliamentary system and therefore the realm should be preserved intact <e> <s> that to my mind is the heart of the matter <e> <s> we must keep it in our minds while debating this subject <e> <s> i imagine that the large majority of this house would endorse that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to the question of the exceptional case that has just been mentioned to your lordships by the noble lord lord hunt in a very few minutes <e> <s> but i wish to begin as the other three speakers at the beginning of this debate began with the matter of principle involved <e> <s> we are debating the second reading of this bill against a background of years of public and parliamentary clamour that there should be much less secrecy and much less use of the criminal law in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords is not damage to the nation exactly what has to be proved by the prosecution before the jury <e>", "<cs> in past years before this bill was published i have been sometimes attracted to the idea that in the context in which we are speaking there should be a reference to the public interest <e> <s> however if there is a principle in this matter it is surely that when parliament legislates and applies the criminal law that law should be made as precise in its terms as possible <e>", "<cs> in moving his amendment the noble lord lord hutchinson spoke of the interests of the government and then again of the interests of the state <e> <s> breaches of confidence in this context can be of absolute importance in terms of the interests of the state <e>", "<cs> in parliament i always dislike transferring something from committee to report <e> <s> it usually leads one into trouble <e> <s> but it is extremely difficult in fact it is impossible to visualise a better draft <e> <s> i cannot help thinking that there ought to be one <e> <s> therefore i hope that my noble friend will be able to respond to the plea made by the noble lord lord mishcon that he will look at this again without any guarantee that anything better can be produced <e>", "<cs> after some years away from responsibility in such matters i may be a little rusty as to the procedures in the security services <e> <s> my first reaction to my honourable friends amendment was that it was unnecessary because it very closely represented what actually happened <e> <s> in fact what happened in the well known case to which i referred on second reading that of the publication of sir john masterss book <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord mishcon and lord hutchinson <e> <s> were right to claim that these amendments are more specific than the original amendment moved by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> i have in one way or another a good many years of experience of the special and peculiar area of secrecy as described by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> every instinct tells me that if the public interest has to be argued in public the kind of secrets visualised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter secrets of vital interest to the nation will be bound inadvertently to come out <e> <s> that is too great a danger to run <e> <s> therefore i am afraid even now that i shall vote against the public interest being a defence <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed an almost identical amendment at committee stage in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend my noble friend lord dacre was concerned lest facilities which had previously been available to ex-members of the secret services would be adversely affected by the bill <e> <s> in that context i hope i am right in thinking and my noble friend will be able to tell me whether i am right or wrong that there has been no change and that the bill does not alter the circumstances for those people <e> <s> the machinery inside the services for such a member to consult is there including <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that earlier my noble friend was concerned with the ex-members of the services <e> <s> i should like to hear my noble friend lord ferrers confirm whether i am right or wrong <e> <s> consultations will be open to such people <e> <s> they are the people with whom i am concerned <e> <s> i hope that such consultation will if necessary be with the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords events have conspired to ensure that this debate is topical <e> <s> i am very grateful to your lordships who have taken advantage of it and who have made so many very informative and interesting speeches <e> <s> in particular perhaps i may say how happy i was that the leader of the opposition the noble lord lord cledwyn felt able to take part <e> <s> one can sum up the debate by saying that it has revealed a strong wish for the continuance of nato as an effective alliance <e> <s> that has been combined with the desire that the western democracies should be able carefully and with prudence to adapt themselves to change <e> <s> i hope that the ideas that have come up in the course of the afternoon are helpful to the government <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that he was giving guidance to the secretary of state in the matter <e> <s> however is it not rather more than guidance if one puts into the statute that <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate whose speech i am glad to follow said at the start that the main theme of this debate must inevitably be the events in the soviet union and eastern europe <e> <s> with his understanding i shall return to that theme <e> <s> it is not that i do not have a <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the words of the right reverend prelate when he expressed his gratitude to my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> i support the principle of the bill and had not intended to speak at this stage <e> <s> however like my noble friend lord perth i have been greatly concerned by the proposition that it should be legal in the future to create hybrid embryos produced by the sperm of a man fertilising the egg of a female animal <e> <s> the noble earl would like to put a stop to such practices now <e>", "<cs> i had exactly the same hope as the noble earl that medical opinion would convince us that there were alternatives which could be used and therefore there would be no need to proceed with the hamster test <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains only for me to express my gratitude to the many noble lords who have contributed to this debate from a wealth of varied and specialised knowledge <e> <s> it has been a fascinating exchange of views and i think a rewarding one for all who have been present <e>"]
