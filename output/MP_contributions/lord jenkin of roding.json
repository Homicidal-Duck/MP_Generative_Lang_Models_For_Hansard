pursue a policy which throws the research and development effort for the production of goods designs or whatever it may be for the benefit of the crown on to industry rather than always doing the designs and inventions in-house which is what has been happening <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may ask my noble friend a question on this point <e> <s> as i understand it this is a keeling schedule <e> <s> it repeats in full the earlier act with the amendments that are being made by this bill <e> <s> in another place i was one of those who argued for more keeling schedules because i

be available for hire <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard my noble friend lord kaberry move the amendment in terms which i thought were completely compelling <e> <s> i am surprised that the government have not felt it right to accept the logic of the matter <e> <s> i have listened to my noble friends argument from the front bench and i am bound to say that the conclusion which he reached caused me some

kaberry indicated <e> <s> i cannot claim to use it very often but the logic of having the same hours for pubs and clubs seems to me to be absolutely irrefutable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the

great deal as indeed did the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i do not know whether it is recognised but a local income tax would actually have a devastating effect on the inner cities <e> <s> perhaps i need to illustrate that with a couple of figures <e>", "<cs> i regard the amendment as nonsense <e> <s> it assumes that there is some magic some holiness some sanctity about the present impact of local government rates on individuals and families <e> <s> in fact i do not think that a single member has dared to raise his head above the parapet and say that we ought to keep the rates <e> <s> why are we getting rid of the rates <e> <s> the answer is that they are well known to be a very unfair and improper tax <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is treading on dangerous ground in calling for harmonisation between england and wales and scotland <e> <s> is it not the case that the amount of government support per head of population in scotland is some per cent <e> <s> higher than in england and wales <e> <s> when my noble friend is considering harmonisation in the interests of some of the hard-pressed areas of the north of england will he bear that fact in mind <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton has explained the very wide nature of paragraph <e> <s> as i understand this provision and no doubt my noble friend on the front bench will be able to enlighten me this is one of the points where a different method of meeting the charge is being adopted <e> <s> the building will be rated <e> <s> the charges to the patient where there are charges will include an amount towards running the building including the non-domestic rate <e> <s> this is a sensible arrangement whereby in some respects a collective charge will be paid through the non-domestic rate machinery <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i stood firmly corrected by my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> i had not read i fear to the end of clause of the bill and i had failed to spot that the definition of a domestic hereditament had been changed so that nursing homes are now not part of the non-domestic rating system <e> <s> for that i can only apologise to the committee and i shall try not to do it again <e>", "<cs> i question whether the noble lord lord morton is right in saying that that is a mistake <e> <s> a few moments ago he was criticising fiercely the fact that in the bill the government have taken powers to deal with the multipliers for the standard charge by order <e> <s> i was not clear whether he was asking that the scots should have the same system or that the english bill should be brought in line with the more rigid scottish act <e> <s> the fact of the matter is no doubt my noble friend on the front bench will confirm it that it is open either to the minister to make the order under section setting the charge anywhere between nought and two therefore the assumption that it will be twice the charge is premature or alternatively the local authority can determine what the multiplier is in respect of the standard charge as regards a dwelling of a particular class <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> no doubt my noble friend will shed a flood of light on all this <e> <s> however it seems absolutely clear to me <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may just pose a question to my noble friend <e> <s> clause perfectly properly catches people who have two homes <e> <s> many members of this committee occupy two homes and will inevitably have to pay the standard charge on what is not their main home <e> <s> that is quite right rates are paid at present <e> <s> then the logic of the bill is entirely satisfied because as no doubt members are well aware one may be registered for voting in local elections in both homes <e> <s> there is nothing whatever to prevent one from casting a vote in two different local authorities though not more than one vote in one local authority so the logic of the bill is absolutely sound <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is drawing conclusions which seem to be at some variance with the facts <e> <s> perhaps if he consults some of his friends in another place he will discover that many of them because of their jobs have to have two homes <e> <s> of course they are registered at both and because they pay rates they are entitled to vote in different elections <e> <s> they are voting for two different local councils to which they pay two lots of rates <e> <s> that has been the law for as long as i can remember <e> <s> why the noble lord should now think that that is some appalling breach of democratic principle passes my understanding <e> <s> that has been the law of the land for many years <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton with rising astonishment <e> <s> my mind goes back to the finance act when the labour chancellor introduced legislation to aggregate the investment income of children with their parents with the express purpose of making sure that those families paid more tax than if the income were disaggregated <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham has stood that argument absolutely on its head <e> <s> i suppose that one should rejoice at a sinner repenting <e> <s> however the fact is that it is the same party it is years on and the argument is exactly the contrary <e>", "<cs> it gives me no great pleasure to say from these benches that i think the amendment which has been moved by my noble friend lord teviot is right <e> <s> i should like to explain the reasons behind my agreement <e> <s> when we published the white paper <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he absolves me from any further responsibility to seek to justify putting a question to <e>", "<cs> i was asking for something rather different <e> <s> i was asking for examples of where individual districts in a particular area were in some way absolving themselves from responsibility for what went on in the pta in their area <e> <s> that is what i understand to mean by distancing themselves from the decisions <e> <s> my noble friend will obviously be coming onto the question of the transitional period in a moment but can we have examples of where this has happened on the ground <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i am obviously grateful for his undertaking that he will consider very carefully an amendment which will convert this into a power rather than into immediate change <e> <s> before he concludes can he address himself to the argument which i sought to put before the committee <e> <s> it is that perhaps one of the reasons why district councils have not addressed themselves with great force to the size of the precepts is that those precepts have been government controlled <e> <s> that is the essence of the transition <e> <s> in fact when he seeks to use the end of the transition period as a reason for wanting to change the system of accountability he is standing the argument on its head <e> <s> the fact is that we have not had a period when there has been accountability because it has been centrally controlled <e> <s> let us wait to see whether when there is not central control the same complaints can possibly be addressed perhaps with some more evidence produced <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one or two brief points <e> <s> i listened to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton with growing surprise <e> <s> in his argument which concentrated upon the effect of the national non-domestic rate coupled with revaluation on the businesses which wil find themselves paying more he did not appear to recognise at all that those which will face the largest increases over the years there are to be transitional provisions to which i shall refer in a moment are those which by definition have benefited the most from the absence of revaluation since <e>", "<cs> if that is a cbi figure it would totally undermine the whole construction of this reform <e> <s> it would mean that one would be building into the community charge an increase charged on individuals because that is the residual <e> <s> the proportion of the local expenditure met by the distribution of the national non-domestic rate would reduce annually <e> <s> the only consequence of that would be that the community charge would rise annually faster than the retail prices index <e> <s> i believe that the retail price index is a very fair measure of the increased costs of local government <e> <s> some local government costs rise more than that and some less but it is not a bad target at which to aim <e>", "<cs> i intervene just to say that i hold myself entirely responsible if the noble lord has been so sadly misled on the point i was seeking to make <e> <s> i was endeavouring to say that since there have been massive differential changes in land values and that the people who will have the largest increases are those who would have had increases over those years but who have not had them and therefore have been paying rates on much lower levels <e> <s> that is the point i seek to make <e> <s> the noble lord was right to say that if rateable values go up the poundage should come down <e> <s> however it is the differentials which have become so out of kilter and that is where the losers come in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have a copy of the letter because the same point had occurred to me <e> <s> it is highly unlikely that in the case of a farmhouse or country cottage which is occupied and where there is a room available for letting for bed and breakfast anyone has for one moment thought of denying to part of that house the p domestic rate which would of course be applicable if the house were wholly rated as a domestic hereditament <e> <s> if it were not it is difficult to see why it should now come in for rating under this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish to add only a word or two to the speeches which have already been made and perhaps rather more specifically than the noble lord lord bonham-carter who has ventured into the whole realm of arts financing <e> <s> perhaps i may just remind him and the committee of the substantial provision that was made by the government at the time of the local government act when the glc and the six metropolitan county councils were abolished <e> <s> there was a substantial increase in the arts council funding in order to make sure that some of the arts ventures and companies that those councils were supporting would continue with public support <e>", "<cs> i welcome the amendment <e> <s> the london borough of redbridge had expressed some dismay that on the drafting of the bill it was apparent that its investment powers were to be much more heavily circumscribed <e> <s> it is now clear that that is not to be so <e> <s> in the past it had been in the habit of lending to bodies such as water authorities and it could not understand why it should not be free to continue to lend the balances standing to the credit of the collection fund in the same direction so i welcome the amendment and thank the government for having moved it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that many local authorities would do well to imitate those who have made partnership arrangements with private sector companies to achieve the refurbishment of which the noble lord lord dean spoke and that where that has been done it has not only provided a highly acceptable standard of housing but a very great improvement on anything that those local authorities were able to do before <e>", "<cs> my lords does the scheme see itself as being complementary to the exceedingly valuable work done over the years by the motability organisation of which the noble lord lord goodman has been chairman for many years and which now proudly boasts that it is the biggest fleet owner of cars in the world because of the number of cars adapted or not which have been made available to disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords as a vice-president of the national association of local councils i was asked at an early stage of this bill whether i would support an amendment which would oblige district councils to hand over a predetermined part of the proceeds of the community charge to the parish councils <e> <s> i made very clear to the officers of the national association that in no way could i support that amendment <e> <s> it seemed to me that it would disrupt the whole structure of the system which has been embodied in the bill <e> <s> i believe that that argument was accepted <e> <s> nevertheless it was impressed upon me that unless there is some procedure and as the noble baroness lady stedman has pointed out this is essentially a procedural amendment there will be as there has <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to my noble friend with great care <e> <s> he has absolutely no need to apologise for having addressed the house at some length because he clearly had some arguments of substance to put to us <e> <s> the only point on which i found myself wondering why he had included the passage in his speech was when he referred to rate capping and to my speech on the second reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> lords the noble lord accuses the government of having pushed the bill through this house <e> <s> does he not recollect that on perhaps the most crucial division of all the division on the amendment of the noble lord lord chelwood a majority of independent peers supported the government <e> <s> does that suggest that the government were using their majority to push the bill through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that anybody could have listened to my noble friend lord rippon without a good deal of sympathy for what he said about the pattern of our legislation <e> <s> however i believe that a dilemma faces any government anxious to make fundamental changes in the way in which we do things in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that one of the most important changes in the british economy has been a recognition of the importance of the role of profit in the economic process <e> <s> can this not be laid very firmly at the door of her majestys government <e> <s> is it not wholly and entirely welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords did not the two periods selected by the noble lord lord dean of beswick also demonstrate the very marked shift from the building of new houses to the refurbishment of some of the disastrous housing estates that had been built in earlier years by governments of all parties <e> <s> does not this programme of refurbishment and the estates improvement on which the present government were embarking at that point represent a major improvement in the quality of rented housing by local authorities <e>", "<cs> as a young barristers pupil i was the tenant of rented accommodation and had occasion with my wife recently wedded to tangle with the landlady of the flat in which we lived <e> <s> i suppose that for a week or so we were subject to harassment <e> <s> my wife could not hang the nappies out in the garden we were not allowed to use the indoor loo but had to use the outdoor one and so on <e> <s> it was all a row which blew over <e> <s> but the very strong impression of unfairness and of impotence which a tenant feels in such circumstances has never left me <e> <s> accordingly when discussing the measures that were to be included in the bill which began when i was secretary of state for the environment i was foremost among those arguing that part i should be accompanied by firmer rules and provisions against harassment <e> <s> i was therefore pleased to see not only the strength of the provisions that had been written into the bill when it was introduced but the amendments moved and accepted in another place <e>", "<cs> i always took the view that if mr rachman had not been called rachman but had been called mcintosh we would never have heard of him <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make one very brief point on the merits of the amendment to which we are speaking <e> <s> on the question of the constitutional proprieties i find myself in very close agreement with the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> that is not altogether surprising because in the past we have both held the office of chief secretary to the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether this motion will allow him to rearrange the business of the house in order to give me an opportunity to answer the personal attack made on me yesterday by the noble lord lord ennals of which he gave me no advance notice whatever <e> <s> would he not allow me to explain that so far from hushing up the black report i sent copies of it to every single newspaper medical journal and social service journal throughout the country and that his accusation is not only false but i am afraid offensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not be beguiled by some of the arguments in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i wish to make a brief point that has not yet been argued <e> <s> it is of course right that efforts should be made to ensure that everyone asked to cast a vote in a matter that is obviously of some importance to them should understand what it is all about <e> <s> as i understand it the procedures have been designed to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i apologise for intervening <e> <s> if a valuer is seeking to put a value on a property which is itself subject to a continuing restriction is the noble lord saying that the valuer will leave that factor out of account when he puts a value on the property <e> <s> of course he will not <e> <s> it is bound to depress the value and that is the basis of the arguments of a number of noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for giving it the opportunity to debate a subject which has attracted a great deal of attention among commentators and the press <e> <s> it gives noble lords the opportunity not only to share the concerns which she has rightly mentioned but also to dispose of a few of the myths which appear to have grown up about the subject and which should be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> i wonder whether he has recollected that on that historic vote in this house it was in fact a majority of the independent peers who supported the government and therefore the whole of his argument based upon the apparent lack of representation falls to the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that what is important is the fact that the european standard now makes provision for smaller cars to have lean burn engines <e> <s> it thus saves countless thousands of motorists the substantial extra cost of having to fit a three-way catalyst or buy cars with three-way catalysts on them when the additional advantage in terms of the emission of hydrocarbons would be negligible <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognised the description given by the noble lord lord williams of how a bill of this size comes to be before us <e> <s> i sat through many cabinet meetings on queens speeches and he described the situation correctly <e> <s> one finds a slot for a bill and hangs everything else on to it <e> <s> however i disagree with the noble lord because i do not believe that the bill is any the worse <e>", "<cs> my lords there was originally a deadline of the end of for agreement to the community directive <e> <s> is there a new deadline <e> <s> what is its relationship to the bills passage through the house <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to take part in the debate although this is a subject by which i have always been attracted <e> <s> however when i heard my noble friend moving the amendment i found myself agreeing with a great deal of what she said <e> <s> surely my noble friend on the front bench has actually i hope that i say this in no sense of unkindness kicked something of an own goal <e> <s> the whole point about the l-plate is that it creates difficulties <e> <s> if you are a qualified driver but you drive with an l-plate in order to warn other drivers you are likely to be stopped <e> <s> however you will have an answer because you can show your driving licence <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not right that one should look at the matter in the broader context <e> <s> was not the very good news which was announced last week that the toyota motor company is now to establish a large factory in this country and all that remains to be done is to decide where an indication of how attractive britain has become to the international motor industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also confirm that under the statutory arrangements which are now in force any shortfall that may occur in one year will automatically be made up at the next uprating <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady jeger shakes her head she is perhaps harking back to the time when her own front bench missed out the period of

dusty answer which was given to sir geoffrey howes request to the russians for support over the salman rushdie affair <e> <s> does that reply from the russians not indicate that <e>", "<cs> my lords i

section between the main line railway and terminal should be in a tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords did not say that that occurred in one day i was implying it occurred in a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by expressing my warm thanks to all those who have spoken in the debate for their broad support for the bill <e> <s> i do not believe that there has been a single speaker who has not thoroughly applauded the proposal that there should be a high-speed rail link <e> <s> that will be a considerable encouragement to the promoters <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not believe that i can give a categorical yea or nay to the noble lords question <e> <s> it is substantially less of a deviation from the promoters route than hillingdon a although not one advocated by my noble friend lord

one must not allow the eloquence of my noble friend lord nugent of guildford to conceal that these amendments taken together would not only as my noble friend the minister said destroy two planks of the bill but they would destroy one of the main purposes of the bill namely to stimulate a significant increase in the efficiency of the water and sewerage undertakings by subjecting them to the disciplines of the capital markets <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for having missed some part of the debate as i was celebrating years elsewhere <e> <s> i listened to the noble lord lord mcintosh of

issue <e> <s> he gives the impression of someone who is erecting on the point of a pin an argument which is primarily based on fantasy <e>", "<cs> i do not see how the noble lord can possibly draw the conclusion that he is now seeking to draw until he knows what the gearing of the companies will be how much of the capital employed in the business will be represented by debt which in exactly the same way as the debt existing at the moment will have to be remunerated by a payment of interest and then how much will be left for equity capital and whether there will be preference capital <e> <s> he cannot draw the conclusion that the rate of increase of charges will be this that or the other on the basis of a view that might be taken i have given my own view of what will be the status of the

<e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend if i pre-empted his answer to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but there is one aspect of the debate which i think has been lost sight of <e> <s> when the government instituted the metering experiments in the isle of wight and a number of other areas it was widely believed that there was a lot of extravagant use of water not just by industrial and commercial users the overwhelming majority of whom are already metered but by domestic consumers <e> <s> as a result not only was there the need for extra investment to meet the demand for water and all the consequences of that there was also notably the need to flood areas of the country in order to provide extra reservoir capacity to meet the demand <e>", "<cs> i must immediately express my thanks and those of my friends lord nugent of guildford and lord elliott of morpeth that the government have moved so swiftly and so decisively to accept the main point of the new clause which we tabled to provide for what used to be called a connection charge but which i believe is better called an infrastructure charge because that describes more accurately what this is about <e> <s> i can be exceedingly brief much briefer than i should have been had i been moving my new clause <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble baroness lady phillips i understand that exactly that problem arises under the present rather haphazard scheme <e> <s> some local authorities will oblige a developer to pay an infrastructure charge when the water authority first installs a new facility <e> <s> thereafter new developers will argue that the facility already exists and that they do not need to contribute <e> <s> the cost will be put on to some other new developer only when a further extension is required <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reported burning of many millions of small nursery saplings and of the widespread expectation that forestry planting this year may be no more than a third of the level that it reached last year is there not a case for a much greater publicity drive to alert companies perhaps foreign companies which might be prepared to invest in forestry in this country <e> <s> they were not able to take advantage of the previous tax regime whereas they can take advantage of the new grant regime <e> <s> if this is not done we shall face a shortage of timber in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say in response to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the question i wish to ask is whether my noble friend recollects that as financial secretary to the treasury i actually published in a very encouraging white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be extremely grateful if the noble lord would give way <e> <s> he has touched on one of the points which cause me and i know some others a certain amount of anxiety <e> <s> he said that the additional authorisation point would make it more difficult for adults to buy alcohol on behalf of

in another place deserves very thorough scrutiny in this house <e> <s> i was a little shocked when he told the house that the bill had its unopposed second reading no doubt on friday two days after it had been published <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is he seriously suggesting that rather than having as the bill appears to provide some designated point where they can queue and be authorised customers have to go chasing round the shop to find somebody who is over the age of <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will stand firm and not be seduced by the arguments <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if the noble lord would allow me to develop the argument <e> <s> it is perfectly clear <e> <s> however to argue as the noble baroness has done that lawyers in the private sector and members of other professions are not subject to the same constraints is wholly to ignore the facts <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord was intervening as i was about to sit down i should say that his argument falls firmly if one adheres to the principle of safeguarding the professionalism and independence of senior local government officers <e> <s> once he has crossed the rubicon and

bring it to a conclusion <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned speaking before i sat down for the second time <e> <s> however let me say that if his noble friend lord mcintosh had not mentioned the honourable member for chorley it had been my intention to do so because that was clearly a totally unacceptable case <e> <s> i accept that not by any manner of means has this been all on one side

"<cs> nobody has denied that it will be difficult to define precisely the proscribed area of political activity <e> <s> there is a nearly seamless robe <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham made some fair points about where the line is drawn <e> <s> he also has a point when he says that it may be easier to have a code of practice which would express the matter in general terms rather than to have specific rules which lay down clearly whether one is on this side of the line or the other <e> <s> that is inherent in any legislation of this kind <e>", "<cs> it is always tempting when the noble lord lord mcintosh is so urbane to agree with him in the interests of harmony sweetness and light <e> <s> however on this occasion i have to say that this amendment is quite unacceptable <e> <s> i say that from the standpoint of one who when i was secretary of state spoke to the national council of voluntary organisations on precisely this subject <e> <s> i believe i made that speech in <e> <s> it concerned the right of voluntary bodies to take part in political debate provided they did not breach their charitable status one is talking primarily here about charities so as to forfeit the tax relief to which they are entitled as charities <e> <s> that is of course a matter for the charity commissioners and for the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> the committee wishes to make progress with the legislation but i have been asked a question and i shall reply to the noble lord <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord winstanley has asked precisely the right question what activities of a local government officer should be singled out as being on one side of the line <e> <s> certainly it is not the nature of the charity <e> <s> nor is it the degree to which the charity is itself a campaigning body <e>", "<cs> i had assumed that that was what we were talking about <e> <s> we discussed earlier whether there should be a voluntary code of practice or whether there should be a code of practice in addition <e> <s> an invitation is now being made to local authority bodies to consider whether a code of practice would help <e> <s> i would assume that this was a matter for the regulations under the clause procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that that particular site has been one of the most discussed and widely canvassed planning applications of the decade <e> <s> is it not also the case that as a result of the earlier refusal as recommended by the inspector of the original mies van der rohe building a very much better building is now to be erected <e> <s> it has always been recognised as my noble friend on the front bench said that this is a matter of balancing the desire to preserve the heritage of the past with the need to provide for the requirements of the present and the future <e> <s> if we are to have a dynamic city it cannot be ossified <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that whereas level playing fields are all very well

we consider with amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which goes a good deal further as my noble friend has pointed out in that it will delete clause altogether <e> <s> therefore it seems sensible that we should have a debate on the principle of that subsection with this group <e> <s> i therefore take the opportunity of addressing a few remarks to the committee in amplification of <e>", "<cs> in this session <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is supporting the bill from the opposition front bench he owes it to the committee to try to tell us how it will work <e> <s> on second reading he said that he did not want to get bogged down in the technicalities of the matter <e> <s> the noble lord brings great skill to us <e> <s> he may not know much about supermarkets but he knows a great deal about the law <e> <s> he must tell the committee how the provision will work <e> <s> he cannot slide over it as he has just done <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening so early in the noble lords speech but the same point was made at second reading <e> <s> are we to understand the results of the survey have not yet been published that that massive response was to express concern about teenage drinking or was it a response about teenage purchases of alcohol in larger supermarkets <e> <s> which was it <e> <s> when the noble lord refers to over district councils were they all aiming at the large supermarkets in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am at a slight disadvantage when commenting on that because the official reporters have my copy of the document <e> <s> however the table from which i was quoting showed that at every age the figures for scotland were substantially lower than the figures for england <e> <s> that was the specific point that i sought to make <e>", "<cs> surely the point here is that a local authority cannot go bust <e> <s> it is very unfair competition if a local authority which cannot go bankrupt competes with traders which can <e> <s> that is something which traders up and down the country have found when they have had to compete with local authorities in areas such as funeral services and so on <e> <s> it is damned unfair competition <e> <s> if the regulations deal with that they will be performing a notable service <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seeks to persuade us as he has done through this and earlier amendments that the mischief which prompted the establishment of the widdicombe committee and prompted a great many of its recommendations is a thing of the past <e> <s> to the government the noble lord says you are shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord who had long and distinguished service in local government until it was abruptly terminated and his respected leader in another place mr kinnock both passionately wish that that were true that the kind of excesses that were going on in some authorities in the late s and earlier s were a thing of the past that somehow all that had now been exorcised and that we should never again see the kind of problems which i faced as secretary of state for the environment between and <e> <s> the committee would be very unwise to base its decisions on this legislation on the belief that that kind of thinking is founded in reality <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble lord <e> <s> the trade

under no circumstances is this the last occasion on which we shall hear the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby address the house on the subject of taxation and finance bills <e> <s> those of us who have listened to him on previous occasions and in other places know that he brings to the subject an immense wealth of experience not least from his former activities at the inland revenue staff

the statement and the change which he has anounced <e> <s> i hope that the house will not take too seriously the strictures of the noble lord lord mcintosh who always seeks to have it both ways <e>

rather more critical view of the amendments than did the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> just before he sat down he said that amendment no <e> <s> smacked of retrospection <e> <s> it is an

mandatory in every case and is seen as statutory <e>", "<cs> we must be thankful for small mercies and for the fact that twixt the syrup and the cup one-half has become one-quarter <e> <s> i only hope that as a result of our brief debate the other quarter will be removed <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> the second part of the bill dealing with community care adopts a different approach from what may be called griffiths <e> <s> that proposes that a large part of the care in the community should be returned to local authorities with specific earmarked funding <e> <s> in a sense that is the solution for which we have been groping for a number of years and which after some hesitation has been adopted by the government <e> <s> therefore the main burden of the noble lords argument falls to the ground <e> <s> if we are to have smaller professional managerial bodies running the health service it would be a nonsense to have statutory representatives <e> <s> and what would they be but representatives of local authorities <e>", "<cs> health authorities should have had budgets for a long time but in that sense this is not a commercial exercise <e> <s> it is not simply a question of subjecting decisions to the test solely of value for money or of profit <e> <s> anyone who has read the white paper will recognise that the quality of care will be equally important in the agreements which the purchasers will make with the providers <e> <s> they will want to ensure that effective quality will be provided <e> <s> why else does the white paper contain so much about medical and clinical audit <e> <s> one must also ask the question why are some doctors so terrified that some of their practices will now be subject to external scrutiny <e> <s> it is so that we shall not have the situation of certain categories of specialists in some areas being able to carry out eight to operations per week while others carry out only one or two <e> <s> one will see quality at the heart of the proposals <e> <s> i hope that as the noble lord develops his arguments against the bill he will not try to exaggerate and say that it simply sets up a market which will be determined on narrow commercial monetary grounds <e> <s> no one reading the white paper could conceivably argue that point <e>", "<cs> it may be that i used the word earmarked meaning that the money is used separately <e> <s> that may have been an exaggeration <e> <s> i was referring to the specific additional funding to fund an additional burden which is being placed on local authorities <e> <s> that is as i understand the matter and my noble friend on the front bench will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> that funding will provide a substantial part of any additional expenditure incurred by local authorities for community care <e>", "<cs> i never said anything of the sort and nothing that i said could conceivably have been interpreted in that sense <e>", "<cs> i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend says in reply to the amendment but i would regard it as extremely surprising if any district could conduct its affairs without doing something along the lines spelt out in the amendment <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment the noble lord lord carter indicated that we were anticipating some of the debates that may take place under part iii of the bill when we consider the community care proposals <e> <s> we shall therefore have an opportunity to return to the subject <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend lady cox as i was not here for her opening speech <e> <s> i found the remarks of the noble lord lord winstanley intriguing <e> <s> he describes a situation which can arise under the present system <e> <s> it is one of the real drawbacks where the producers become obsessed or fixated by one particular speciality <e> <s> if a powerful personality heads that department the other services are starved because the purchaser has no clout <e> <s> who is the purchaser at the moment the taxpayer and the patient <e>", "<cs> the core services include many hospital geriatric and psychiatric services <e> <s> presumably they will cover the great bulk of services for elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is deeply indebted to the noble lord lord hacking for drawing attention to what i think by any standards is one of the most far-reaching and from my point of view most welcome proposals that we have had for some time from the commission in the field of pharmaceuticals <e> <s> nearly a year ago i had the privilege of being invited to make the keynote address to the annual conference of the european federation of pharmaceutical industry associations which is as it were the european trade association for the pharmaceutical industry efpia <e> <s> at that conference we were addressed by the commissioner responsible dr martin bangemann <e> <s> i found it quite interesting to see how much common ground existed between the commission and many of those who addressed the conference including i add with humility myself <e> <s> i drew the conferences attention to precisely the point that the noble lord lord hacking has mentioned about the erosion of the effective patent period because of the conflict between two different regulatory procedures to which the industry is perhaps more subject than any other <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord was right to make the point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend mentioned japanese <e> <s> is not the justification for the foreign offices sensible policy that he outlined to the house the fact that for many years in our embassy in tokyo we have had far more fluent japanese speakers than are to be found in the embassies of any other european country and i suspect of any other country in the world <e>", "<cs> i must begin with an apology to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale because i was not in my place to hear him move the amendment <e> <s> however i have sought to inform myself of the burden of the case that he made which i have to say is not one that is unfamiliar <e> <s> on a number of occasions one has heard it advanced by <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord intervened when i thought that i had already sat down perhaps i may respond briefly <e> <s> i share one hundred per cent <e> <s> the view expressed a moment ago by the noble baroness lady young about the extraordinary ambivalence of local authorities when they are faced with the question of general or specific grants <e> <s> when they have a specific grant they argue passionately for a general grant the revenue support grant as it is now called <e> <s> when they wish for something particular to happen or some service to have priority they argue passionately for a specific grant <e> <s> i suspect that if we were to go down the road of making this a specific grant as sure as eggs are eggs within a few years the local authorities would be back saying it is tying our hands <e> <s> it is destroying our initative <e> <s> it is removing our incentive to innovate and develop our services <e> <s> can it not now be returned to a general grant <e>", "<cs> is this not a case of putting the best before the good <e> <s> is it really suggested that local authorities should not be free to implement this very important part of the bill <e> <s> i acknowledge the commendation which the noble lord lord seebohm has just given <e> <s> i share his view in saying that this is an extremely important part of the bill <e> <s> as i read the clause is it seriously suggested that there has to be a kind of tripwire in that no local authority can go ahead and implement these plans until all local authorities have satisfied the government that their resources are adequate <e> <s> presumably it would be only then that the secretary of state would be able to make his commencement order <e>", "<cs> i must begin by apologising to the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> with the best will in the world i failed to arrive here for the beginning of the debate on this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that she mentioned the point and i have acknowledged that <e> <s> the arguments for index linking or regularly increasing child benefit have perhaps taken far more into account that this is a benefit akin to pensions invalidity benefit or all the other social security benefits <e>", "<cs> i have wearied the committee at some length but perhaps i may answer that <e> <s> i have consistently argued both in and out of government with successive chancellors of the exchequer that the levels of child benefit should be considered at the same time and in the same context as the levels of tax allowance <e> <s> had that been done and the measure had retained more of the characteristic of a child tax allowance we might have found ourselves in a rather happier position <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not be beguiled into accepting the arguments of the noble earl lord russell or accepting his amendment <e> <s> when i was secretary of state for the social services and that ended in the administration of the supplementary benefit scheme and in particular the administration of the single payments system within the supplementary benefit scheme was already causing severe problems for the whole system <e> <s> the people who suffered from that were not only the staff of the social security offices who had formidable problems as anybody who <e>", "<cs> i shall give way as soon as i have finished the sentence <e> <s> the noble earl has engaged the attention of the committee for a considerable time this afternoon <e> <s> i have calculated the amount that he has already asked us to spend and i believe it comes to over half a billion pounds <e> <s> however i may have got that wrong <e> <s> in the five years since i ceased to be secretary of state for social services the amount has multiplied times <e> <s> that occurred because the payment was available <e> <s> landlords knew that they could demand deposits because tenants could go to the supplementary benefit office and obtain payment for those deposits <e> <s> i believe it is flying in the face of reason to argue that this availability did not encourage landlords to demand deposits <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should ask him whether he agrees that most reasonable employers are only too happy to offer a new employee starting work a sub as it is called after a fortnight or even a week <e> <s> they are happy to do this for a new employee who clearly needs money in his pocket in order to be able to live <e> <s> it would be a rum employer who was not prepared to offer that in the interests of keeping that employee <e>", "<cs> my lords after the masterly rehearsal of the case for the bill by my noble friend lord geddes and the other speeches made in its support i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> i spoke on second reading and argued then that it was quite inappropriate that opposition to a bill of this kind designed to improve the infrastructure of our ports industry and in particular an important east coast port to which the whole emphasis of our trade has moved over the past years should be quite openly used as a vehicle for the protection of a particular industry <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord crickhowell i must challenge the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friends statement was absolutely up to the expectations that i had <e> <s> i was delighted to hear what he said <e> <s> i hope that it will receive wide publicity not only in the country but in particular in the coalfields <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to support the bill <e> <s> the point made by a number of noble lords is that it represents a remarkable compromise and a collaborative effort by diverse and disparate interests which over many years have been engaged in conflict sometimes almost ending up in fisticuffs as disputes over rights of way have developed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the government will not be tempted to go down the road suggested by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i agree with a great deal of what my noble friend lady gardner of parkes has just said though my memory of the events on the paving bill for the abolition of the glc may be a little different from hers <e> <s> the bill was not lost <e> <s> an amendment was passed which made life a great deal more difficult for everyone concerned including the staff <e> <s> she was quite right on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not have that date to hand <e> <s> it was in fact some while back two years or more <e>", "<cs> my lords there was the original green paper before that was there not <e> <s> my recollection is that there was a consultative paper <e> <s> but i stand corrected from all sides <e> <s> i am told that it was a white paper <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies perhaps i may offer one or two comments on the matter <e> <s> in doing so i declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of a company which acts as an agent for the importation into this country of paper from scandinavia <e> <s> the paper industry in this country is increasingly alive and alert to all the various problems of pollution and conservation <e> <s> it has a very close interest in these matters <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree <e> <s> in i was the first secretary of state to get a government department to use nothing but recycled paper <e> <s> that was the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i feel that i must intervene at this point <e> <s> however i am willing to be corrected on what i have to say by my noble friend or anyone else <e> <s> i do not call that recycling it is taking necessary steps to protect the public from what would otherwise be very harmful material <e> <s> i think that that has always been a perfectly proper expenditure of public money as we know when we go back to the history of public health <e> <s> i am not sure that the point the noble lord is making is valid in the context of his amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might mention a small point which i possibly should have raised by <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly before my noble friend responds to the noble baroness <e> <s> one must be cautious about the wholesale condemnation of virgin materials to use the expression in her amendment and the preferability of using recycled materials <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before the noble lord withdraws his amendment <e> <s> i have listened to the debate with some interest <e> <s> in the house where i used to live we were exactly two chicken and chips away from a kentucky fried chicken shop <e> <s> when customers finished their two chicken and chips they had an empty box and i had to pick that out of my hedge <e> <s> it is extraordinary how regular are the habits of the customers of the kentucky fried chicken shop <e>",

make it perfectly clear that if your dog performs in the park and you do not clear it away you are guilty of an offence under the regulations <e> <s> it is an extension to that law which is required <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to follow the noble lord lord ezra who mentioned the tidy britain group <e> <s> when i was secretary of state it was called keep britain tidy <e> <s> however since that time it has been substantially revamped <e> <s> one of the interesting aspects which came to my attention soon after i arrived at the department of the environment was that the group was the largest single private sector recipient of grant aid from the department <e> <s> in those days that is and it received <e> <s> however the group is now substantially larger <e> <s> i rise merely to ask my noble friend on the front bench whether during the course of his reply he will remind the committee of the amount of the grant given by the department of the environment to the tidy britain group at present <e>", "<cs> i should have a good deal of sympathy for the amendment were it not for the fact that i had experience as secretary of state for health of having to deal with the tobacco advisory council over the implementation of the messages which must be included on cigarette packets and advertisements <e> <s> it is a complex business not because of the complexity of the message which was agreed eventually between the department and the tac but on the question of size how prominent it should be the colour contrast and all other such things <e>", "<cs> the noble lord prefaced his remarks by saying that he did not think that this was a case for regulations <e> <s> that is precisely what i said <e> <s> the amendment calls for the government to make regulations <e>", "<cs> i raise an anxiety that has been expressed to me about this new on-the-spot fine system <e> <s> i make it clear that i believe the experience of westminster has suggested that it is a good system <e> <s> i do not comment on the particular point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord renton does not need to apologise <e> <s> in a sense the two amendments raise much the same issue from different aspects <e> <s> in the hope of addressing amendment no <e> <s> i should like to pick up some of the points which my noble friend has made about the unsuitability within our cabinet and parliamentary system of establishing an agency such as the noble lord lord mcintosh has suggested <e>", "<cs> of course it goes back but there will be many secretaries of state <e> <s> i pick up the point made by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i do not understand how such an agency will reconcile the differences which inevitably arise between departmental objectives <e> <s> the normal processes of discussion and argument result in a decision of the government as a whole <e> <s> i suspect that the only result of imposing such an agency on the system will be to add yet one more voice one more body that has <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed a few words in reply to the accusations levelled at me in his charming way by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> of course it is not every decision which would need to reach a cabinet committee <e> <s> there are a great many actions and proposals by government and individual departments that can be agreed and implemented without the matter ever reaching a formal committee <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend could help me a little further on this point <e> <s> i listened to his argument with great care but the oft looked at the matter and concluded that it did not interfere with competition <e> <s> i ask my noble friend therefore what is to prevent the itc coming to the same conclusion <e> <s> the undoubted mischief which exists in the powerful case made by the noble lord lord annan and about which my noble friend has expressed some sympathy remains <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the factor which appears to bear most upon the readiness of populations to engage in sensible family spacing is the education of women <e> <s> in the consideration of the aid programme will my noble friend give ever increasing attention to the education of women in the developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that for many of us the fact that the statement has been made is extremely welcome and that that is much more important than where it was made <e> <s> secondly can my noble friend give further information about the heathrow express railway bill <e> <s> from what one has read so far there has been no indication that it will be possible for trains on that railway when it has been approved and built to continue on to liverpool street yet i know that that has been in the minds of ministers <e> <s> can my noble friend throw any light on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that this new clause is much welcomed <e> <s> it so happens that i was recently chairing the first ever conference arranged by the national association of waste disposal contractors <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise most sincerely to the noble baroness <e> <s> i did not see her attempt to rise to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this will be third time lucky and it is to be hoped that i shall be able to say a few words on the matter <e> <s> this proposed new clause was published on the very day when i was chairing the first conference of the national association of waste disposal contractors <e> <s> this body has played an extremely positive and important role in the formulation of the policy which led to part ii of the bill <e> <s> i think that i shall be reflecting what was said at the conference when i say that the members of that association are totally committed to achieving the highest standards of waste disposal <e> <s> they very much welcome the tighter regulation which the bill contains in order to if i may put it colloquially curb the activities of cowboys some of whom have done a great deal of damage to the reputation of what is by any standards a very important industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the noble lord lord lloyd with great interest <e> <s> he explained that amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to import into the bill the phrase the best practicable means <e> <s> is that phrase intended to be synonymous with batneec that is the best available techniques not entailing excessive cost <e> <s> it seems to me that what may be practicable may at the same time be quite unreasonable from the point of view of expense <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will clarify what his amendments are intended to convey in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will bear with me because i believe that this is an important point which may cause some anxiety <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and use the phrase the best practicable means of waste treatment and disposal <e> <s> in the past there have been arguments about bpeo best practicable environmental option as opposed to bteo best technical environmental option <e> <s> on the whole that has given way to a concept which has been referred to at length throughout the bill namely batneec best available technique not entailing excessive cost <e> <s> when the noble lord uses the phrase best practicable means is that synonymous with batneec <e> <s> if so why does he not say that <e> <s> if it does not mean that what does it mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that these additional words will not be necessary <e> <s> there is little doubt that the creation of this new duty on the part of waste producers to take care is perhaps one of the most fundamental reforms in the bill <e> <s> i am sure it will be widely recognised that hitherto a waste producer has had only one concern to get rid of his waste as cheaply as possible <e> <s> he has had no concern to see what happened to it after that <e> <s> if he could find someone who was prepared to undercut the responsible man who treated it properly who transported it properly and looked after it properly someone who did not do those things he might have done so <e> <s> many responsible manufacturers would not go down that course but some undoubtedly have <e> <s> as a result waste has turned up where it should not have been <e> <s> it has been transported in thoroughly unsuitable vehicles and without proper protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that when i first read the amendment on the marshalled list i thought that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey was on to something <e> <s> however on closer inspection i have seen a number of irremovable flaws <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not weary the house by reading out subsequent paragraphs <e> <s> but the paragraphs are perfectly clear <e> <s> paragraph states <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be drawn into a long argument about who is a fit and proper person <e> <s> i merely ask those who are interested to obtain a copy of the paper that was read at the nawdc conference to which i referred when speaking to an earlier amendment by mr stephen tromans a solicitor <e> <s> he delivered what i found to be a most fascinating and disturbing paper about the importation into this sphere of the law of the concept of a fit and proper person <e> <s> there are ramifications in the legislation which a skilled lawyer can see and they startled his audience considerably <e> <s> for example references have been made to people who have been directors of large companies which have been convicted of an offence <e> <s> such a person might be so appalled by what has happened that he resigns from the company and joins another on the footing that its standard will be much higher <e> <s> in those circumstances the other company could lose its licence because it has as a director a man who at a relevant time had been a director of a company which was convicted <e> <s> that is the kind of technicality that will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> earlier today i was reliably informed that the nawdc members have put up <e> <s> therefore perhaps industry is doing a little more than the government and they deserve tribute for that <e>", "<cs> my lords my concern about the bill arises directly from the amendment moved by my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> it is that the scottish people seem to be quite undesirably discriminated against <e> <s> it has been the common view in all parts of the house that the new arrangements which are set up in part ii of the bill for separating authorisation from disposal providing new and stringent controls through the licensing system establishing new offences for breaches of the terms of licences and so on are all with the express intention of improving the environment through the much better handling of waste <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he answer a brief question about amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> i noted that he said that he was not prepared to accept amendment no <e> <s> g for the reason that even a statement to the effect that there was an entry which had been excluded from the register could be prejudicial to national security <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that strategic planning issues affecting london do not stop short at the boundary of greater london but can be addressed only in the context of the regional guidance which secretaries of state for the environment issue to serplan from time to time <e> <s> do the terms of that guidance not demonstrate beyond peradventure that to create separate strategic planning for the city of london and the london boroughs would do little more than add a layer of bureaucracy with no apparent advantage to anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear whether amendment no <e> <s> extends to cover straw burning or whether that is covered in the bill as it stands <e> <s> there has been universal condemnation of straw burning as being a nuisance to a large number of people <e> <s> it is to be banned in two years time <e> <s> that is extremely good news and a long way from the arguments that i had five years ago with the department of agriculture <e> <s> however far too much straw burning is still being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the welcome provisions of the bill is the extent to which it <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess immediately that i have not researched the debates which took place on the earlier legislation to which the noble lord lord tordoff referred when he said that the words or manufacturing process had been taken out <e> <s> it may be that they are not in exactly the same case as this <e> <s> i should like to argue quite strongly that the words or manufacturing process should remain <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend indicated that the most significant issue dealt with in this group of amendments is the relevance of previous decisions by licensing authorities to any proceedings for a statutory licence <e> <s> my noble friend has gone a very long way to meet the case <e> <s> as drawn the subsection was open to misinterpretation in that it effectively sterilised the whole of the previous history surrounding these businesses <e> <s> this is what has been feared <e> <s> my noble friend has made clear that it is the governments intention that the only matter which the tribunal is precluded from considering and being influenced by is the actual amount of payment <e> <s> that is precisely the point that my amendment was <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he may care to remind the house that when i on behalf of the recording industry sought an interview i had no difficulty whatever in obtaining a <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter the debate solely as a result of the experience of having been the secretary of state responsible for the two organisations in the very early days when they were finding their feet having been established under the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> i do not like any of the amendments in this group <e> <s> the amendments of my noble friend lord swinton suffer from the difficulty upon which both the noble and gallant lord lord carver and the noble baroness lady nicol firmly put their finger <e> <s> once one gives the chairman of the countryside commission an opportunity in effect to have an alternate one devalues his presence <e> <s> if it is regarded as important that the chairman of the countryside commission should be a member of the jncc

colleagues would find themselves too upset if one said that it was very important that he should attend and the same will be true of his successor in due course <e> <s> i find that argument persuasive <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is one matter about which i am sure all noble lords will be in total agreement it is the fact that my noble friend lady blatch is very well able to take care of herself at the dispatch box <e> <s> i shall therefore be extremely brief in what i have to say <e> <s> however there are one or two matters which i must raise in view of the somewhat intemperate nature of the attacks which have been made on the front bench here by the noble lord lord mcintosh the noble lord lord ross and others <e>", "<cs> my lords i used the phrase government front bench as meaning <e>",

follow the admirable example of the noble lord lord chorley and not repeat the arguments that were addressed at a different stage <e> <s> i agree with every word that my noble friend lord renton said <e> <s> i am unable to support the amendment which my noble friend lord norrie has moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i have studied the amendment but i do not think that it deals with a problem that i had to cope with which still rankles <e> <s> a notification of a sssi was made at a site near bristol <e> <s> the land was at that time in the possession of a well-known construction company whose chairman i shall refer to in a moment <e> <s> a few days before the notification was due to take effect the companys staff totally destroyed the site so there was no point whatever in notifying it <e> <s> as secretary of state at the time i wrote an extremely angry letter to the chairman of the company but to this day i have never received a reply of any kind <e> <s> the chairman of the company was mr gerald ronson so perhaps that is not altogether surprising <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> is it not perfectly clear that if detailed surveys were to be undertaken on the sites of the many thousands of hectares of contaminated land it is estimated in the white paper that more than half of derelict land is probably contaminated the costs would be far higher than anything my noble friend has mentioned <e> <s> what is required is enough desk study information so that someone who expresses interest in the land concerned will have enough information to know whether it is then worth carrying out the much more expensive and detailed survey that would be needed before such a person could contemplate development <e> <s> is that not a sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i must reiterate the point that a more detailed study must be carried out by the developer who is interested in developing the land <e> <s> i fail to see why that charge should fall on the public purse <e> <s> the developer must decide what the contamination consists of and therefore how much he is prepared to pay for the land <e>", "<cs> my lords it has now become almost universal in

environmental hazards in the land <e> <s> that is the purchasers responsibility <e> <s> it is a condition of sale <e> <s> the vendor has to provide the necessary facilities so that the purchaser can

contract for buying land one has to satisfy oneself as to what it is one is getting <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was secretary of state for the environment i sought to persuade my cabinet colleagues

entirely sound <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent major new relationships between the world of forestry agriculture and conservation being developed in the future when the country committees have settled down and the joint conservation committee has undertaken the role that has been spelt out in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord winstanley and take issue with a
