["<cs> my lords this debate involves consideration of two problems the problem of protecting wives and the problem of protecting lenders <e> <s> i venture to participate with some trepidation notwithstanding the welcoming noises which have been made by those who have already spoken <e> <s> for years i have been substantially concerned with the problems of wives and lenders although fortunately the problems have been of a professional rather than a personal character <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the infant amendment put forward by the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> i do so on two grounds in the hope that <e>", "<cs> as a former practitioner in the companies court perhaps i may draw attention to the very great step that is made in this bill <e> <s> there is already legislation and material for dealing with fraudulent persons and for the first time this bill attempts to put limitations on incompetent directors <e> <s> the whole object of clause as i understand it is to protect creditors from incompetent directors <e> <s> the reason that they need protection is that towards the twilight end of a companys existence it is really trading although it may not know it on the creditors money <e> <s> it is accepted by both the government and those who moved amendments that we need to move into the area in which incompetent directors can be disqualified and also will possibly have to pay towards the companys liabilities <e> <s> that obtains from both the amendments and the governments original proposals <e> <s> so the principle is apparently acceptable <e>", "<cs> a company does not go into liquidation because a director resigns that is the answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> a company can go into liquidation only if there is a resolution of the creditors at a meeting properly called or if there is an order of the court under the presentation <e>", "<cs> with great respect that is a confusion of thought <e> <s> clause is the clause which concerns automatic disqualification and clause has nothing to do with the differences between one director and another <e> <s> clause says this whether you are an accountant or a bookmaker or whatever you know if you take on the responsibilities of a director and you do not know within a month of a compulsory order that that company is on the rocks then either you are fraudulent or you are incompetent probably incompetent <e> <s> therefore it is not under clause that one needs to differentiate among directors <e> <s> all directors ought to know in how sorry a state a company is within a month of its being killed off by the companies court <e> <s> if they do not they have no right to be directors <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the select committee i should like to express gratification for the contributions which have been made to this debate <e> <s> those contributions have endorsed the decision which was made by the select committee to investigate this very difficult but important question and have endorsed all the main conclusions of the select committee with the exception of the scrutiny proposals to which i shall refer in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too beg to support the recommendations of the fraud trials committee <e> <s> the report is so omniscient and so exhaustive that it even copes with the homespun point raised by my noble and learned friend lord edmund-davies <e> <s> paragraph is a plea for the facilities for witnesses to be improved and paragraph is a plea for the courtroom to be made large enough to house not only the innumerable counsel and their solicitors about also the tons of correspondence and papers that proliferate in the course of a long fraud trail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting anything other than that which is in the report <e> <s> to my mind the report is eloquent rational and reasoned <e> <s> i can see no argument against it except the fact as the noble lord says that some of these practices were invented years ago and the fact that they are outdated has not been universally recognised <e>", "<cs> i also oppose these amendments but for a slightly different reason <e> <s> as i understand the noble lord lord campbell of alloway he is not trying to wreck the bill <e> <s> he agrees as i understand it that there should be some machinery in our law for enforcing the convention <e> <s> what he now proposes is that it should be done by way of judicial review <e> <s> judicial review is carried out by two judges of the divisional court of the queens bench division <e> <s> what this amendment says is that none of her majestys judges shall have jurisdiction to hear the convention except two judges of the queens bench division subject to an appeal to the court of appeal and then to the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the european communitys production of cereals exceeds the amount that the community consumes or sells at <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure and privilege to follow my noble and learned friend lord ackner and to congratulate him warmly on his maiden speech in this house <e> <s> in the manner of his speech my noble and learned friend displayed that wit charm and eloquence which made him such a formidable protagonist at the bar and in the content of his speech he demonstrated that concern for justice and fairness and the experience which has made him a renowned judge on the bench <e>", "<cs> this amendment together with later amendments i have in mind amendment no <e> <s> and amendments nos <e> <s> to raise the same question of what limitation should be placed on a building society that undertakes conveyancing and estate agency work <e> <s> there should be no more limitations than are necessary in the interests of the public <e> <s> but two questions arise <e> <s> there are two interests to protect <e> <s> the first is the interest of the public in getting the best advice and getting impartial advice <e> <s> the second interest that i still put forward notwith-standing the remarks of the noble lord lord barnett is that it is in the public interest that the solicitors profession should be protected not against competition but against unfair competition <e> <s> it is to those two principles that i address my remarks <e>", "<cs> i am not here to defend each and every solicitor <e> <s> there are solicitors scattered throughout england most of them in firms of three four or five <e> <s> those in the country know the whole of the country <e> <s> they know the people who live there and those they are dealing with <e> <s> they know how to advise old ladies they know how to advise the spendthrift <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will be aware under the treaty of rome the council of ministers is the primary legislative institution of the community <e> <s> it is the council which makes community law and not the european parliament or the commission <e> <s> there is democratic control over the council which consists of ministers from the member states each minister being answerable to his elected parliament <e>", "<cs> i am obliged my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the select committee will be gratified at the informative and knowledgeable debate which has taken place in respect of their report <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich has great experience in this field and is well appraised of all the constitutional and historical bases for the privileges and immunities of members of parliament in this country and abroad <e> <s> then we had the noble baroness lady elles and the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos putting succinctly and well the two different though i would not say opposing views of a member of the european parliament on the one hand and on the other the view of a member of the house of commons <e> <s> there is a conflict of history and a conflict of approach between those two <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend section of the land registration act and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> nine hundred years ago land in england was registered in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the weighty and unanimous support accorded to the bill <e> <s> i know that the law commission will be gratified that its very long and careful investigations and report have found favour so far with your lordships <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the support of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor speaking for the administration and my noble and learned friend lord silkin of dulwich speaking for the labour party <e> <s> i hope that the weight of that support will speed the bill not only through this house but also through another place <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e> <s> i am always mystified by the drafting of acts although when they have been drafted and i have been asked to construe them i do so without any difficulty at all <e> <s> i acknowledge the difficulty raised by the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich and will take further advice <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill as it emerged from committee represented the combined wisdom of the law commission the chief registrar the lord chancellor parliamentary counsel and the law society <e> <s> having heard the objections raised by the noble lord lord mishcon with his vast experience and the objections raised by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords in commending the bill in its present form to your lordships i should like to echo the tribute paid by the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to the law commission and in particular mr trevor aldridge <e> <s> mr aldridge was a member of the law commission in when the law commission first set its hand to its report and has been of great assistance in marshalling the amendments and consulting the land registry to make sure that the bill is in a form which is acceptable to all those interested in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the task of the courts in construing acts of parliament was explained by lord reid in <e> <s> he said in the case of beswick v beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords the green papers contain far-reaching proposals some good some bad and some indifferent <e> <s> on the principal question that has been raised this morning namely the constitutional issue i for my part am as i believe we all are very well satisfied that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor intends no attack on the integrity or independence of either the legal profession or the judges <e> <s> at the same lime i hope and expect that the noble and learned lord will recognise the depth of feeling and the importance of the subject not only to the professions but to the citizen <e> <s> i have no doubt that he can and will make amendments to the proposals which will have the effect of restoring the confidence of the bench the bar and the law society in the proposals which have been made with regard to the control of the profession and its practice <e>", "<cs> my lords while i share to the full the dislike of retrospective legislation this is a special case <e> <s> it is not directed against insurance companies <e> <s> it is directed to a bargain and a bargain should be carried out <e> <s> what happens is that the insurance company enters into a bargain <e> <s> it takes a premium and agrees to pay if there is an injury within the policy <e> <s> years go by <e> <s> the fact that the risk matures is not known to anybody because it is one of those diseases which does not reveal itself until later after the injury has been caused <e> <s> when the injury is caused there is a cause of action the insurance company has to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall venture to answer that point <e> <s> the two-year period applied right across the board <e> <s> it had nothing to do with personal injuries <e> <s> it is quite inappropriate to a disease such as asbestosis where a man is employed and thinks he is well but years later it is discovered that he has the disease <e> <s> a two-year period for such a disease is useless <e> <s> all the experience of asbestosis and other such industrial diseases shows that a -year period is required <e> <s> it is arguable that there may be a case for years <e> <s> however the government have chosen years <e> <s> in nearly every case the disease will have manifested itself within years but it will not do so within two years <e> <s> that is why one has to go from two years to years <e> <s> the amendment is carefully drawn so that it only applies to those kinds of injury where through no fault of the injured person he wakes up years later to discover he has contracted this disease while working for his employer <e>", "<cs> while i accept all that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor says perhaps i may ask him to consider this point <e> <s> as a result of the debate on the green paper the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has introduced a number of safeguards <e> <s> they will prevent the evil arising of an estate agent acting on behalf of vendor and purchaser and will prevent multidisciplinary partnerships being exploited so that building societies and insurance companies collect commission from all kinds of operations to the detriment of the purchaser <e>", "<cs> there is a great problem here and i am not sure how the bill will resolve it <e> <s> i know that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor wishes to resolve it <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and a on clause raise questions of fundamental importance <e> <s> first is there a difference between a business and a profession <e> <s> secondly is it wise or right to believe that anybody can do anything in any trade or profession whether trained to it or not <e> <s> thirdly is it right that if there is a difference between a business and a profession this legal profession should be left within limits to govern itself and lay down its professional rules <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask for information on this amendment <e> <s> the committee has now agreed that under clause the law society may make rules which prohibit solicitors from entering into any unincorporated association with persons who are not solicitors <e> <s> so when five multi-disciplinary chaps get together assuming that the law society makes a rule as permitted by clause they are bound to say but we cannot do it as an unincorporated association <e> <s> that is easy enough <e> <s> we can buy a company off the shelf and we become directors and shareholders <e> <s> although in law it will be a separate entity in fact we shall just be the same five jolly chaps all doing the five different disciplines which the law society has made rules against and therefore we shall not be bound by those rules <e>", "<cs> my lords the members of the judicial committee of your lordships house have a good deal of practical experience of fraud of its ramifications both in this country and abroad and of its serious effects on the innocent people who suffer from it <e> <s> i hope therefore it will be thought appropriate that i should rise to support the work of the sub-committee and express the hope that the many necessary reforms indicated in the report will be actively pursued <e>"]
