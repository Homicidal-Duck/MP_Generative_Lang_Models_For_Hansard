["<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will allow me to speak i gave an indication that i would be speaking but the list of speakers had already been stencilled <e> <s> i will detain your lordships for only a few moments <e> <s> i speak as a layman in every sense of the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that however tenuous is the connection between the authentication by the foreign office of these signatures and any involvement in the boycott process it gives the very strong impression that there is a connection <e> <s> will the noble lord also bear in mind when considering the result of this inquiry that a select committee which included members from all parts of the house was quite unanimous in strongly recommending that the foreign office should cease to be asked by its ministers to authenticate these documents so removing the impression that the government are anything but totally impartial as between the friendly states both israel and the arab states <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the great satisfaction that his statement will give to the voluntary organisations <e> <s> is he also aware that those organisations are indeed ready to back up any support that the british government are able to give and any assurances on behalf of great britain that we will not be behind-hand in the future as in the past in dealing with this infamy <e> <s> further is the noble lord also aware of the great admiration which some of us have for the personal part that he has already played in this business <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the select committee which was drawn from all parts of the house and of which lord caccia was a member there was unanimity in rejecting the evidence of the foreign office given that the authentication was merely of the signature and did not imply any approval of the boycott document <e> <s> is he aware that we felt very strongly in that committee that the government should get out of the boycott process in which they are now involved and will continue to be involved until they cease this authentication process <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to say that i personally in welcoming what the noble lord lord wade has done for us for the third time must assure my noble friend lord carr of hadley that i do not believe that the passing of this bill will do anything to change the constitution in the way in which the noble lord has suggested he thinks it needs changing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to sir henry fishers valuable evidence to the select committee and he is perfectly right that sir henry fisher was dead against the bill <e> <s> however would he agree with sir henry fisher in the evidence he submitted to us that in fact a plaintiff if this bill were passed and the convention became part of united kingdom law could not be worse off and could be better off than as things are today <e>", "<cs> as an independent member of your lordships house perhaps it is impertinent of me to say so but i must say nevertheless that i greatly welcome what we have been told today and indeed what was hinted by the noble and learned lord on the woolsack at the end of the second reading debate that there is the suggestion that there should be a get-together between the parties on any constitutional issue on which the parties think they might possibly be able to find agreement <e> <s> i feel that this bill which is our immediate business this afternoon is only one very small step towards the improvement of our general arrangements and therefore although a cross bencher i must say how much i welcome the initiative which has been taken and greatly wish it success <e>", "<cs> i do not want to enter into the legal niceties of this but i should have thought that it was clearly the intention of this bill if the words <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene with possibly the shortest speech that will be made this afternoon to say that what the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden said seems to me to be conclusive and it was endorsed by the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> i wish just to add my endorsement for one not very good reason just as lord alexander had a very great deal to do with the local authority response to the compact made in the education act i had a very small part to play because for seven years i was the permanent secretary of the ministry of education from to <e> <s> i will not trouble your lordships with any detail <e> <s> but it seems to me absolutely true that there is the danger of a breach of faith not with the people who are alive today but with the people who in those years first agreed round the table with the noble lord lord butler and chuter ede and william temple and people that we have now lost and with the education authorities without whose collaboration in the following seven years we should not be where we are today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put in a word of very strong support for what has been proposed by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> i know that there is power in both the local authority and in the national health service to see that what we all want to happen does happen but i am satisfied myself that realistically speaking with local authorities so cut back and restricted in their ability to raise money for proposals more politically viable than the health of the mentally defective and mentally ill they are not going to do what is wanted unless there is a very clear instruction from parliament that there must be collaboration between them the national health service and voluntary organisations <e> <s> that seems to be the essence of the proposals made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that birkbeck is a unique institution as is the open university and that although it is an integral part of london university as has been pointed out it does serve exactly the purpose which i think the whole house would agree <e> <s> we wish people who are thrown out of work in the present recession to find that they can exploit the situation not by stopping the work they were doing at birbeck but by continuing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise as a member of the select committee who i think knew less than anyone in the house this afternoon about lloyds when i was honoured by the invitation to be one of the five members <e> <s> i want to say thank you to the house for having given me the privilege of serving on that select committee and to echo very briefly because that is all that we can do at this stage what has been said about the chairman who undoubtedly played a major part in leading us to what i believe were the right conclusions <e> <s> i should also like to thank all my colleagues on the select committee particularly those who like myself have not been much experienced in the work of select committees and still less in the work of lloyds
