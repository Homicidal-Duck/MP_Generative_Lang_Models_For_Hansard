["<cs> my lords we have had a long series of debates on this subject plus a report from a select committee composed of members of this house <e> <s> one might well be pardoned if one takes the view that there is nothing more to be said on this subject at least in this house although it is fair to say that the other place has been if not notably silent at any rate very quiet on the subject which perhaps in itself is of significance <e> <s> on previous occasions i have ventured to point out and i repeat it now that notwithstanding some of the emotive if not emotional arguments that one sometimes hears put forward there appears to be no demand by the public for this bill at all <e> <s> on the last occasion when we debated this i mentioned the complete lack of interest of the national press in the subject matter of our select committee report when it was published and the fact that only one member of the press turned up at an arranged press meeting that one member being a gentleman who is known for his passionate interest in this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his intervention but with great respect i cannot see that because sir garfield may have operated under a statutory constitution which incidentally is entirely different from the american type of bill of rights constitution that in any way disqualifies him from expressing views on the subject of judicial activism with which he is as familiar i would venture to think as any other common law judge <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there may be marginal cases where an individual is concerned where that individual may derive some benefit from the bill but that entirely overlooks the crucial point that it is the broad effects of the bill on our legal system which will be a much greater detriment as against those comparatively small marginal advantages which will be to the benefit of the individual <e> <s> the noble lord may not accept my argument but i hope he appreciates that it is the nature of the view put forward by those like sir henry fisher who oppose the structure of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention but if i attempted to answer it we might get into a very broad field and one which might bring our present master of the rolls speeding to these benches to intervene <e> <s> i will therefore refrain from attempting a detailed reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord permit me to put one question to him on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him this question does he not think that we are paying too high a price and i do not refer to this purely in financial terms to enable small nazi groups because that is what they are in the name of so-called freedom of speech to inflict inflammatory racialist slogans on areas which have apparently been deliberately chosen on account of their large coloured population <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my gratitude to my noble friend lord ardwick for giving us this opportunity to discuss this topic <e> <s> i say that particularly as i was responsible for initiating the earlier discussion which took place in december <e> <s> time seems to pass in these matters year succeeds year and yet we still find that nothing has been implemented <e> <s> it is fair to say i think in relation to the time of our previous debate that we were all awaiting perhaps with some apprehension the outcome of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant task to be the first to offer our congratulations to the noble viscount who has just spoken for his admirable charming and extremely well informed maiden speech <e> <s> he has also if i may say so set us all a very pointed lesson in the art of delivering an interesting speech with the highest degree of brevity <e>", "<cs> i am particularly gratified that he should have chosen this subject to come along and address us upon for the first time because it is a subject of immense importance but nevertheless one which on the whole does not tend to arouse very great interest having regard to the number of those who actually attend our debates on this subject in your lordships house <e> <s> i am sure it is our wish that the noble viscount will attend our proceedings frequently from now on and address us on this subject as well as on others about which i am sure he can speak with full competence <e>", "<cs> i too must apologise for not being present at the beginning of the debate having been detained unfortunately by professional obligations <e> <s> it seems that however welcome clause may be it lacks a certain amount of particularity <e> <s> therefore i welcome the alternative amendments that have been advanced both of which spell out the particular nature of the problem and the way in which it can be dealt with with a good deal more particularity <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to add a word in support of this amendment <e> <s> i confess that i have never been a person of sufficient importance for anybody to wish to tap my telephone <e> <s> nevertheless i share the tremendous public concern that is felt over this matter a concern which was reflected recently in the judgment of the vice-chancellor in a case which came before him in which he made it clear that he thought our law was most inefficient <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late <e> <s> i understand that there is another subject for debate to follow <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to detain your lordships for more than a moment or two <e> <s> however i do not think i can refrain from thanking all noble lords who have been good enough to participate in this debate and to say that certainly in my view their contributions have been most valuable and have made this a most stimulating and excellent debate <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i was unable to be present at the committee stage of the bill but i do feel constrained to say a few brief words on this subject at report stage and to say those words in support of the view which has been put forward by the noble lords lord jenkins of putney and lord birkett <e> <s> having had quite a considerable association with the film industry over many years i hasten to say that my interest there has been a public one and not a financial one i can remember few occasions if any when all the various interests of that industry have come together in a unanimous conclusion <e> <s> it does seem a little unfortunate since i understand that the government have at earlier stages consulted with the industry in relation to this bill that is this instance when it comes to this seemingly comparatively small but nevertheless crucial amendment the matter has been dealt with without fully taking into account the views of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to confine my few remarks to one of the arts which has <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister bear in mind that the whitford report on copyright reform was published as long ago as and that in a debate on the governments green paper of which took place in this house exactly two years ago the noble lord the minister himself remarked that all responses to the green paper should be in by august and moreover that every effort would be made to introduce legislative proposals as urgently as possible <e> <s> does not the noble minister agree that the two years that have elapsed since that time have been adequate time to enable the government to formulate legislative proposals for reform in this most important field which affects among other things two crucial industries in this country namely the record and film industries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister whether the government recognise that the real threat to the film industry which might result from the abolition of the eady levy will arise if nothing is put in its place <e> <s> in particular does he recognise that the national film and television school in which as i am aware he has a close interest depends for one-third of its income on eady and that the national film and finance corporation looks to eady for practically the whole of its resources <e> <s> finally does he recognise that the loss of this revenue would seriously disrupt the entry into the film industry of the young talent which is essential for its future <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the national film and television school and a member of lord wilsons interim action committee i should like to say that i welcome a number of features of the white paper which obviously i have not had a chance adequately to absorb as yet but i am bound to say also that i have some reservations which i do not think i can expatiate upon at this stage <e> <s> all i can appropriately do now is to ask one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate and i should like to thank all of your lordships who have come along to contribute to it <e> <s> particularly i would mention the very interesting maiden contribution from the noble lord lord layton even though as he will appreciate i did not altogether agree with all his arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i must begin by offering your lordships an apology as i am afraid that it is impossible for me to remain until the end of this debate <e> <s> the noble lord the minister began by pointing out that i was responsible for initiating an earlier debate as recently as last december on the white paper on film policy which is of course implemented in this bill <e> <s> therefore i am anxious to avoid any unnecessary repetition of the various points which i endeavoured to emphasise at that time <e>", "<cs> as one of the signatories to this amendment i am of course happy to support it though i am bound to say that i do not feel totally satisfied with the manner in which it is framed <e> <s> it bears a somewhat uneasy relationship to the next amendment on the order paper <e> <s> there are some aspects of it which personally i would not think represent the best ways in which to introduce a levy <e>", "<cs> as one of the signatories i should like to add my support to this amendment <e> <s> i should point out once again that i do not altogether go along with the language of the amendment <e> <s> in particular i believe that it ought to cover blank tapes as well as pre-recorded tapes and it is a little unfortunate that the amendment directs its aim at supporting individuals rather than creating a fund to support the film industry generally <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that his recognition of that makes all the more important the fact that the cinema industry should be saved <e> <s> if we simply say that we have films on television and that is good enough that will result in letting the cinema industry fade out of existence <e> <s> if i may add further to that does he not recognise in the light of all the arguments presented from so many informed quarters that the great sum of million a year over five years is trifling in relation to the problem that faces the film industry <e> <s> i ask him to take seriously the points being urged by people who fear a dramatic and disastrous collapse of the industry if no further money is fed into it beyond those relatively modest sums <e>", "<cs> by way of supporting this amendment i should simply like to congratulate the noble viscount lord falkland on his brilliant exposition of the deep unease that is felt on every side of the industry over the consequences of this removal from the scene of an excellent body the nffc and its replacement by a purely commercial entity which seems to be totally ill-equipped to tackle the serious problems that face the film industry at the present time <e> <s> i can only express the hope that the noble lord the minister will take very seriously indeed the devastating attack that the noble viscount has made upon these proposals and the attempt in this amendment to reinforce the situation so far as it is possible to reinforce it within the structure of this bill <e> <s> i think that those of us who oppose this arrangement feel that the only satisfactory way would be to scrap this whole concept of the consortium and go back to some genuinely independent body which could be expected to carry on the true tradition of the nffc which the government have claimed it is their desire to maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot but express a certain degree of sadness after listening to that reply to the arguments that i attempted to put before your lordships <e> <s> i wish to choose my words with a certain amount of care but i am bound to say that i cannot see that the noble lord the minister with the greatest respect for him has really attempted to address himself to my arguments at all <e> <s> for example he tells us as if it is a point against the school that the films act does not mention our school by name <e> <s> in view of the history of the matter which i hope that i put clearly before your lordships how can that possibly be an argument of any kind against the entitlement of the school to support from the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a brief word in support of this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh has said it is very much improved compared with the previous amendment <e> <s> on the previous occasion i expressed some dislike for the exact form of the amendment <e> <s> first of all this amendment covers blanks and it does not limit the redistribution to individuals which i think was the great defect of the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment i should like to take as realistic a view as i can <e> <s> i am far from accepting all the arguments that the noble lord lord willis adduces against the idea of a television levy <e> <s> i think the noble viscount has put the arguments extremely well <e> <s> but i do not wish to join in that particular debate because i recognise that the government have quite made up their mind that they are not going to support a television levy <e> <s> therefore i prefer if i may to concentrate my few words on the tape levy which seems to me to afford the principal hope for getting additional resources into the film industry which is what those of us who support the film industry wish to see achieved <e> <s> for this purpose i should like to divide my remarks <e> <s> first i shall deal with pre-recorded tape involving feature films and then say a work about blank tapes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble minister for his rather negative reply may i ask whether he is aware that the lord chief justice in the course of his judgment in that case referred to the profits of the film pirates as enormous and said that the legitimate trade in feature films was potentially crippled <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that he also stated that the law has not yet entirely caught up with this type of offence <e> <s> may i therefore ask the noble lord the minister whether he would accept that such offences with the grave threat they pose to the feature film industry go a great deal further than mere infringements of copyright even though i accept that the penalties have been increased for those that they amount to theft of intellectual property and that the law should so treat them <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord lord mishcon i would ask the noble lord the minister whether he is aware that the report of this case which has so far as i know yet appeared only in <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chairman of the british film institute and the national film archive i naturally welcome the statement that the noble earl the minister made regarding the progress which with his assistance the british film institute has been able to make <e> <s> but is he aware as i am sure he is that the two collections to which reference has been made the path news library and the movietone news library contain an absolutely unique collection amounting to a visual history of the first half of this century and that in a very short space of time perhaps two or three years they will be irretrievably lost because they are on nitrate <e> <s> in those circumstances will he indicate that he will be prepared to take some initiative either to goad or perhaps to encourage the two companies which own these librairies namely thorn emi and twentieth century fox to take some appropriate effective action to ensure that such a disaster does not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords since your lordships have i think had five bites at this particular cherry beginning with the rather differently constituted bill in favour of a bill of rights which was moved in by the then lord arran taking into account of course the select committee which we had in <e> <s> i think which was presided over so admirably by my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale and of which i had the honour to be a member <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble and learned lord who has saved me from making what is now an otiose observation <e> <s> i do not need to refer further to that <e> <s> i hope i have clarified the limited objective of my amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i should like to express thanks for the generous treatment that has been accorded to my amendment by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> the only comment i would venture on his suggestion that it might be treated as a mere clause of interpretation is that it seems to me with all deference to be inappropriate not to use a stronger word to have a rule of interpretation in a statute that appears to run counter to the established constitutional principle that an act of parliament by one parliament shall not bind a successor parliament <e> <s> it therefore seems to me far more appropriate that the proposed change should be made <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to weary your lordships with a vote at this time of the evening particularly after the very fair discussion that we have enjoyed on this particular amendment <e> <s> i am prepared to withdraw the amendment now but i reserve my right to reintroduce it on report if the noble lord lord broxbourne forms the view after further consideration that he is unable to reintroduce the amendment in a verbally-modified form on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my silence and failure to reply to that question is an indication that there is no precedent <e> <s> all that my silence indicated was that i had not applied my mind or my research to the possible existence of such a phrase <e> <s> it may be that there is such a phrase and it may be that there is not <e> <s> i do not think that one can infer merely from my silence that i have scrutinised the whole of the statute book and can say resolutely that such a phrase does or does not appear <e> <s> it would not surprise me if there are examples <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may suggest that the appropriate word might be intelligible rather than legible <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support for this amendment <e> <s> unfortunately i was not able to be present at the second reading of this bill but having read <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who ventured to speak in favour of the previous amendments of the noble learned lord lord silkin and in view of the intensity of the argument that has been expounded on either side on this occasion i feel justified in saying what i hope will be a brief word in favour of the revised amendments tabled by the noble and learned lord lord silkin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sorry if i misquoted him but i quite accept the point he makes that it is to be preferred to the jungle of law that is i suppose the combined consequence of the common law plus a multitude of statutes <e> <s> i recognise that there is no arguing with a tiger and it may be that the secretary of state would prefer to have his argument with a tiger presumably on the basis that tigers can be assumed always to support secretaries of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to confine my remarks to the copyright section of this massive bill <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the secretary of state for being in the happy position of introducing major reform in our copyright law <e> <s> it is true that it has taken years to produce the result <e> <s> the whitford report was made public in <e> <s> after the publication of a green paper in i had the privilege of introducing a motion in your lordships house which some noble lords may remember in which i expressed regret that five years had already passed <e> <s> i wondered how many more years would need to elapse before the final product was presented <e> <s> we now see it after a further five years <e> <s> nevertheless we can rejoice at the outcome in so far as the bill achieves its objective which in the main it does <e>", "<cs> my lords it always gives me pleasure to express commendation of any course that the noble lord lord broxbourne has taken and i am sure that those of us who have had to practise and operate under the act realise that it was in itself valuable legislation <e> <s> this is not to say that its drafting was entirely satisfactory as i am sure the noble lord would be the first to concede <e> <s> i suspect that if he has had an opportunity to read the massive amount of succeeding legislation he would agree that the bill is in a much more satisfactory form <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure what point the minister is seeking to make <e> <s> is he saying that there are certain people i do not doubt that there are such people although they must be in a small minority who possibly use tapes for purposes other than copying copyright material <e> <s> that is part of the argument that the government themselves have referred to as rough justice and there is some element of rough justice in that <e> <s> nevertheless it is beyond dispute that up to per cent <e> <s> of home taping involves the taping of copyright material and there are ways the government themselves have indicated them in which those exceptional situations may be met <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord broxbourne feels that that has occurred in this instance as well as others <e> <s> be that as it may i should like to conclude by saying that while one welcomes the bill as a very important contribution to our intellectual property law one hopes that the grave lacuna that i have ventured to point out will be given serious attention by the government <e> <s> i hope that at least in the course of later debates on this bill not necessarily in this second reading debate they will throw further light on their intentions <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps declare an interest if only a minor one as a part-time author but perhaps i may say a few words on the question of originality to bring the issue down to earth <e> <s> the concept of originality and copyright as the noble and learned lord lord denning pointed out goes back to <e> <s> it was not defined then and never has been defined <e> <s> the only question that really concerned the court and created any real difficulty was whether this idea of originality involved some notion of real creativity <e> <s> does it have to be something like a poem by keats or a play by bernard shaw to qualify for copyright <e> <s> the court had little difficulty in accepting the notion that it was not that kind of originality which was being stipulated <e> <s> therefore there has been a whole series of decisions which have held that even things like railway timetables not great specimens of literary creativity qualify as original works and are entitled in appropriate circumstances to claim copyright <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest the appropriate phrase here would be a moving image <e> <s> we are for example in the process of creating a museum of the moving image at the moment under the auspices of the british film institute on the south bank and that has become the recognised phrase when one is talking about images which move on a screen <e>", "<cs> i think we are losing sight of the issue under this provision <e> <s> we are only considering who the author is <e> <s> surely it is as plain as plain can be that the man who is the author of a photograph is the man who has taken it the photographer <e> <s> that has no immediate consequences so far as copyright is concerned that is a rather different question which we shall be discussing at a later stage <e> <s> however from the point of view of authorship i should have thought with respect that it is perfectly plain that the photographer is the man who is the author of the picture <e> <s> he is the person who <e>", "<cs> in the case which the minister has adumbrated for us the only question is who is the photographer <e> <s> is it the man who has organised the session or is it the assistant who just mechanically presses the button when he receives a direction <e> <s> i think that the court would have no difficulty in a case of that sort in saying that the photographer was the man who was functionally organising the whole operation <e> <s> i do not believe that that is a case which would create any problem <e>", "<cs> i should not like in any way to diminish the immense contribution that my noble friend lord willis has made to many films or depreciate his creative role <e> <s> although i agree with him i feel considerable sympathy for the amendment because in a sense the film director is regarded as a kind of author of the film <e> <s> the french use the word <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support this amendment which seems to be based on a very sound principle <e> <s> if one looks at the history of the matter i think one would probably find that in the early days of photography photographs were necessarily regarded as rather ephemeral works because of the susceptibility of the material to vanish with the passage of time <e>", "<cs> surely the main objection to amending the subsection by leaving out the word substantial will lead to even more unsatisfactory results <e> <s> a few trivial words trivial in every sense could be used in the alleged infringing document and as those words were undoubtedly a part even though not a substantial or a significant part one would necessarily have an infringement <e> <s> surely the very reason why one has this word substantial in the existing legislation is in order to avoid that result <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to question the ministers good faith and sincerity after he has given us his assurances even though to some extent they fall short of what i think was the fully justifiable request made by the noble earl lord ferrers for something a little firmer <e>", "<cs> we have pressed the minister pretty hard <e> <s> one appreciates the difficulty of his position <e> <s> the minister is speaking to us as one would expect as one of her majestys ministers in perfectly good faith and sincerity <e> <s> we ought to proceed on the basis which i feel is totally justified in the circumstances especially at this late hour that it would he inappropriate to pursue the matter further and to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i am naturally grateful as i am sure the committee is to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i am bound to say that i still remain somewhat unpersuaded that these provisions are strictly necessary <e> <s> however as i indicated at the beginning i have no intention of pressing this amendment and therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree that there seems to be some difficulty in deciding why it is necessary to have the provision whether the word is incidental or unintentional <e> <s> so far as concerns unintentional we already have section which gives one a defence if one did not know or had no reason to believe that copyright subsisted in the work <e> <s> it is not altogether plain why this particular limitation is being imposed on the copyright owner <e>", "<cs> as my name appears on the marshalled list i wish to speak briefly in support of the two amendments having some experience of the matter if i may say so as the chairman of the national film and television school <e> <s> the problem has been a vexing one in the school and in other similar establishments <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran mentioned the film department of the royal college of art which performs a similar function <e> <s> the government in giving considerable financial and other support to the national film and television school recognise the importance of film education as an essential arm of the film industry of this country <e> <s> it is therefore desirable that such an institution should not be impeded on what is a rather technical ground <e> <s> after all the use of such background music for the purposes of teaching film is not likely to cause any great harm <e> <s> in practice as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran pointed out it is hardly practicable for such institutions to apply to copyright owners each time that it is necessary to incorporate part of a musical work as background music to a film <e>", "<cs> i spoke regarding this matter at some length on second reading and i have no intention in saying that i warmly support one or other of these amendments of attempting to rehearse at length the arguments which have already been adduced <e> <s> more particularly as the noble lord lord willis has made the case so clearly and so eloquently it would be idle to seek to add very much to what he has already put before the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words as regards the amendment <e> <s> i have also received a communication about this matter from the managing director of no less a periodical than the <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of the convention on human rights has been debated on numerous occasions in your lordships house since the noble lord lord wade <e> <s> introduced his bill in <e> <s> one can only admire the pertinacity with which the topic has repeatedly been rehearsed <e> <s> however one cannot but feel that where considerable constitutional changes are contemplated one would expect the main initiative in the matter to come from the democratically elected house <e> <s> strangely enough the other place appears except for the recent introduction of sir edward gardners bill which failed in the last parliament to have had very little interest in the issue <e> <s> perhaps it is not without significance that none of the members of the other place has chosen under the ballot system this particular topic as one which he wishes to ventilate in a new bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry did i use the wrong word <e> <s> i meant to say legislation <e> <s> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> if the word written is not included <e>", "<cs> i agree with what has just been said <e> <s> it is clear that in the realms of copyright one is not entitled having bought a copy of a book to take it home and copy it for ones own private uses <e> <s> there seems no reasons why this exception should be made by what is seemingly a side wind by these words being inserted in a general clause dealing with infringement <e> <s> i should have thought that the retention of these words would require some kind of express justification of which i do not feel i am aware <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the objectives of the amendment urged with his customary eloquence by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however merely to try slightly to modify the law of legal aid is not an adequate way to cope with the problem <e> <s> there is no doubt that there is a substantial lacuna in our law long recognised and one which is dealt with comprehensively in modern american law by the so-called class action <e> <s> in this country we have only two ways of coping with the situation <e> <s> one is by means of a test action and the other is by a representative action <e> <s> but without going <e>", "<cs> my lords before we pass from this amendment perhaps i may briefly say that i am naturally rather pleased that the proposal that i made in committee stage that the phrase moving picture should be replaced by the expression moving image has been adopted <e> <s> i mentioned at the time that this was an accepted modern phrase and i instanced the case of the museum of the moving image which the british film institute is now busily engaged in establishing on the south bank <e> <s> i am glad that the government have recognised that this phrase is a more flexible one than moving picture for which some members of your lordships house expressed a continuing affection <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke to the earlier form of amendment moved in committee by the noble lord lord williams of elvel i pointed out that while i profoundly sympathised with the notion of giving the maximum recognition to the director of the film who undoubtedly plays a crucial role in the ultimate product that emerges from the screen nevertheless in practice in the film world it is generally recognised as considerable sense to regard the person who makes the arrangements to put the film together primarily as the author of a film <e> <s> he is the person who provides the finance for that purpose or arranges for the finance to be obtained by the distributor or whoever it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that amendment no <e> <s> is likely to lead to considerable difficulties and at any rate in its present form i believe it would pose very great problems for newspapers <e> <s> for example let us suppose a journalist is asked by his editor to write an article or series of articles on a particular topic for insertion in one or more issues of his newspaper <e> <s> is it then to be said that if that article or series of articles is to be farmed out by the journalist to some other newspaper whether here or abroad that is another purpose <e> <s> it seems to me that that might well be the construction of this section and it would mean that a newspaper could not have an exclusive right in the production of its own journalists and that seems to me to lead to a very extraordinary anomaly <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the view expressed by several noble lords that when we deal with amendment no <e> <s> serious consideration must be given to the restriction of one year contained in the amendment <e> <s> however it seems to me that at this stage of the debate the only <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton in regard to film directors <e> <s> i ventured to disagree with him at an earlier stage when it was suggested that the copyright should vest jointly with the director <e> <s> i did so on the grounds which i think the government supported that this was a matter which could be left to contract <e> <s> however when one comes to the issue of the directors moral right he ought <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> as i understand it the right to claim damages for infringement of the moral rights set out in section will either be a tort or will certainly he in the nature of a tort <e> <s> it is the general principle in tort law in contrast to contract law that damages may be obtained for injured feelings <e> <s> i can find no special reason why it should be excluded in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak in support of what has been said by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i believe that he has put his finger on some important weaknesses which may emerge if clause is <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the strong reliance that the government place upon the practical consideration i do not feel that it would be appropriate to do other than ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i confess that i am not totally persuaded by the eloquent defence which the minister has put forward for retaining these words i do not feel that i would be justified in pressing this upon your lordships <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express some sympathy for the minister on that point <e> <s> i think that there is a danger <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who put down an amendment at an earlier stage to omit what was in clause which was also supported by the noble lord lord hacking i should like to say that unfortunately i was unable to be present when that amendment was due to be moved <e> <s> i should like to express my satisfaction that the minister has now recognised that the clause contained an anomaly which was repeated from the earlier act <e> <s> i heartily endorse his moving that the clause be omitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> again i am sorry to say with apologies to your lordships i was unable to be present when an amendment i had tabled at an earlier stage was reached <e> <s> there is no need for me to repeat the reasons that were so clearly given by the noble viscount lord brentford <e> <s> this seems to go beyond the wording of the berne convention for the reasons that the noble viscount gave <e> <s> i strongly support the proposal that these words or authorised be omitted from the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved an amendment along these lines on a previous occasion but withdrew it because the minister put forward practical considerations that seemed difficult to resist <e> <s> if as suggested there are ways of meeting these practical difficulties for the commissioners of customs and excise perhaps the point deserves reconsideration <e> <s> therefore i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state has extended his congratulations on the remarkable success of the last emperor in winning nine oscars recently in hollywood <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he agrees that it would redound more to the credit of this country and to the support for the film industry of this country if it were not a fact that that film was financed almost entirely by continental bankers and that neither the private nor the public sector contributed anything more than a fairly trifling contribution to its production <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in fact saying that the fate of those great studios at elstree is a mere matter of commercial judgment <e> <s> does he not agree that the studios are an important component in our film industry <e> <s> are the government not willing to show some concern about the future of those studios and exert whatever influence they can to affect the outcome of this sale which is in breach of previous undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords i was among those who in an earlier debate strongly supported the concept of rental right <e> <s> i therefore strongly support amendment no <e> <s> b for the reasons cogently put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> lord willis <e> <s> i shall not repeat them because i could not formulate them with the same degree of cogency <e> <s> suffice it to say that the amendment has my strong support <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord lord williams of elvel i regret that i cannot agree with his view of the effect of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must declare an interest as the author of a number of books which can and possibly have been used for research purposes or private study <e> <s> my views are not influenced by the modest returns that the work of producing books of this kind entails <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a subject that is calculated to arouse great passion but nevertheless it is one as we have witnessed this evening that is capable of producing acute differences of opinion among some of the most acute of our legal intellects <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships have been greatly stimulated by the differing views that have been expressed on what might seem on the face of it to be a fairly straightforward matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for the view just expressed by my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> the movers of the amendment appear to wish to confine the restraint to overthrowing by violent means which obviously refers to ostensible and visible means of action <e> <s> of course that is one way by which parliamentary democracy might be overthrown <e> <s> but surely there exists a whole area of much more insidious activity with which we have perhaps been familiar not only for many years but for generations <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing is certain and that is that the legal profession does not lack critics <e> <s> but at the same time it possesses as has been reiterated over and over again this afternoon two admirable features <e> <s> the first is that of independence both judicial and professional and the second is the very high degree of integrity which applies to all branches of the profession and to solicitors equally with barristers <e> <s> however one cannot overlook the fact that even though we may have as the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce reiterated the best bar or the best system in the world and though as is often said it is a thoroughly rolls-royce system we have to pay the price for that system <e> <s> we must not forget that the legal system that has developed is extremely expensive and is not easily accessible to the ordinary man in the street <e>", "<cs> my lords the present government have sometimes been accused of not being a listening government <e> <s> however i really do not believe that that accusation can be fairly levelled at the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> it may be that he is not to be totally exculpated from showing some degree of undue haste which is not uncommon in governments but as regards listening to comments and criticisms i believe that he has if i may say so behaved in an exemplary fashion <e> <s> he has listened to all possible criticisms he has engaged in public debate all over the place and as has been remarked even in the course of our two debates on this subject he has most diligently sat through all the speeches put before him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin on a slightly personal note <e> <s> some years ago i was taken on an official visit to auschwitz and given the opportunity of seeing the surrounding circumstances in which the most appalling outrages and horrors were committed probably unique in the history of the world <e> <s> speaking for myself i remember extremely vividly everything that i saw and was shown on that occasion <e> <s> when it is said that the memories of the people who were actually the victims and the subjects of those terrible torments and outrages cannot be relied upon in subsequent trials which take place many years after i am bound to say that i do not find that argument impressive <e> <s> i thought that the evidence provided by <e>", "<cs> i am naturally most delighted by the reaction which the amendments have provoked on the part of the minister <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his detailed and careful explanation of how the government propose to deal with these matters <e> <s> clearly one was not able to follow in detail the precise points that the noble lord made <e> <s> i propose to study his remarks when they appear in <e>", "<cs> if the minister reaches the conclusion that this matter is an unsuitable one on which to seek to amend the bill will he give some consideration to referring the question to the law commission who could consider it at leisure and involve itself in all the complexities which have been revealed during the debate <e>", "<cs> if that is the convenient course i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> i find the noble earls reply a little disappointing <e> <s> i did not find the arguments that he pressed against my amendments were particularly powerful <e> <s> as i pointed out although it is true that voluntary arrangements exist at the moment and i am sure channel sincerely wishes to continue with those arrangements that body will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is some objection in principle to subsection as it now appears in the bill although i do not necessarily associate myself with everything that has been said by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> to my mind the objection is of a much more general character in that here you have a body which is set up to assume what i imagine to be a more or less quasi-judicial role <e> <s> when complaints are made its job is to adjudicate on those matters in a dispassionate way after considering all the evidence and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords my name appears as a supporter of this amendment and i should like to make one or two brief comments <e> <s> the matter has been argued with such eloquence and knowledge by the noble lord lord willis that it is unnecessary to repeat any of the arguments illustrating that this is the sort of situation which calls for more adequate legal protection <e> <s> if the privy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble earl is unable to accede to the proposals of the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> he does not consider that the amendments will make a useful contribution to the difficulty although with his customary courtesy he recognises the problems <e> <s> i am sorry too that he does not feel that within the time still vouchsafed to the government which is obviously very limited anything effective can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have supported my amendments <e> <s> i am also grateful to those who have expressed such kindly good wishes towards me personally <e> <s> perhaps it was an error of tactics on my part to impede the noble earl in moving the amendment <e> <s> by that means i might have achieved more success in the enterprise than i otherwise have <e> <s> at this stage i cannot seek to press the amendment although i am sure that to have made the project comprehensive instead of limiting it to commercial channels and would have been of considerable value <e> <s> however in those circumstances i believe that i have no alternative but to ask your lordships leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
