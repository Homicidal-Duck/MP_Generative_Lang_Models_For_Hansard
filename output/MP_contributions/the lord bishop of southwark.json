an undertaking that in the governments forthcoming changes in immigration rules and nationality law no provision will be made regarding british subjects born overseas which in fact amounts to a distinction between white women and those who are coloured <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government consider it essential for these demonstrations to continue in the interests of free speech could not

interested party it would be inappropriate for me to add to what they have said except to mention that one of those churches was on the agenda paper of my first staff meeting years ago <e> <s> it

is the minister aware that the state of community and police relations in brixton is something which has been giving cause for great concern over recent years <e> <s> i should like to say in relation to that question that that is a question which i have been very reluctant to put and very sceptical about because i know very well what an intensely difficulty job the police have to do on our behalf often acting in some degree as our scapegoats <e> <s> i know at second hand from a friend in uganda what it is like to live in a country where law and order has largely broken down <e> <s> i know also that it is not easy to be constantly criticised especially if that criticism shows a lack of understanding of the job one does and the majority are given a bad name because of the faults of a minority

it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with some hesitation on a subject which is both complex and controversial and when we have already had some weighty and informed contributions from noble lords opposite and from the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i hope your lordships will find it helpful if i make a small contribution from the standpoint of someone whose diocese includes most of south london and who has some particular concern and responsibility for church of england schools in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had two excellent speeches from the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord byers and i hope the house will forgive me if in some respects i cover something of the same ground it is sometimes a help if the same points are made from a slightly different

knowledgeable and helpful maiden speech <e> <s> i began by thinking that i would share some sympathy with him because i made a maiden speech on this same subject of housing almost exactly two years ago but i quickly realised that there was no need for sympathy but only for admiration <e> <s> he knows a great deal more about the relationships of private landlords and tenants than the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich says i know about council housing <e> <s> i wish i did know a lot about it although i suspect that if i knew a lot about the finance involved i should be rather a boring person at times <e> <s> it is a winsome characteristic of his if i may just say this to pay his friends generous compliments which often have rather little relationship to reality <e>", "<cs>

know it well <e> <s> many but not all of them are involved in the life of local churches there <e> <s> some of what i say will inevitably reinforce points that have already been made by the noble lord lord allen and in the subsequent speeches but i think it is helpful to us to learn something of local comment <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will not be surprised to hear that i too wish to speak about clause of the bill in respect of the charitable housing associations since many of them are sponsored and supported by the churches <e> <s> charitable housing associations have very often been drawn from local churches acting together in a particularly strong and valuable form of ecumenical service <e> <s> i do not want to waste your lordships time by needless repetition particularly in view of the very clear and powerful speeches which we have already heard this afternoon and the literature which we have all received over the past few weeks and months <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord evans of claughton pointed out we are bound to work over this particular ground very closely because it is an issue of such vital importance <e> <s> there are particular points to be made which we shall need to make from our own perspective <e> <s> therefore i hope noble lords will bear with me for a moment while i summarise briefly what appear to be the principal points at issue and

debate <e> <s> i did not realise it would last as long as it is going to last and of course the number of speakers is a reflection of the importance of the subject <e> <s> i am very sorry i shall have to leave <e> <s> i have not had to do this before and i particularly apologise to the noble lord lord molloy who has introduced the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to use a little of my nine minutes to congratulate the noble lord lord mulley on his very interesting and informative maiden speech <e> <s> i always enjoy listening to someone who speaks from considerable parliamentary

consciousness when the need to take action about unemployment is seen by most of us as overwhelming and urgent <e> <s> it is for this reason that my first proposal is short-term immediate and relates directly to the statement made by the chancellor of the exchequer on th november at col when he stated that tax changes already made <e>", "<cs> my lords when the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester spoke last june in the debate on the local government interim provisions bill he commented on the remarkable degree of concern among church leaders over some of the proposals contained in the white paper <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a few contributions to the extremely important debate on the amendment by way of just commenting on one or two things that have emerged during the course of it <e> <s> the first is that i noticed the extent to which on both sides we are very much involved with fear <e> <s> i illustrate that in this way <e> <s> there is on the one hand fear of a phoenix rising from the ashes <e> <s> that has been a dominant theme in a number of speeches this afternoon <e> <s> outside this house people refer to the danger that the baby will grow again into another monster <e> <s> it seems as if so many people are concerned about that that they think that that is what must be stopped at all cost regardless of the consequences <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much for that <e> <s> what i was trying to say was that we are a body i believe which has very limited powers yet i do not believe that we have an unimportant task to do <e> <s> that was the point that i was wanting to make <e> <s> it seemed to me that that was a valid point to make in this context <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a brief statement because i know that time is getting short <e> <s> i wish to address myself in a slightly different way to the question which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter raised <e> <s> the noble lord asked what was special about this <e> <s> i listened with particular attention to what the noble lord lord beloff was saying because it seemed to me that he was in part supplying the answer <e> <s> he was pleading for us to recognise the importance of not allowing party politics to dominate the elections to this particular authority which serves only the cause of education <e> <s> that is something very close to my heart and that is why i have put my name to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for making that point and i recognise that it will be a point of difference between us <e> <s> i just wanted to make that point which is an important point in general terms about the principle <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury has given us a very clear and full explanation of the numerous difficulties which some people are now facing as a result of the rules made under section of the immigration act and he has strongly criticised some of the procedures involved <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton speaking from very long and full experience has rightly given us the overall background which is relevant and i fully take that point but acknowledged that there are some difficulties for specific people and that we need to do more to minimise these <e> <s> it is on that aspect in particular that i wish to speak for a few moments tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what the noble baroness the minister has had to say in introducing these regulations again <e> <s> as she has reminded us they are an attempt to deal with a problem which has escalated in terms of both size and cost <e> <s> i suppose that this is an example of demand welfare which any government would be facing at the present time <e> <s> i do not want to dispute that <e> <s> it has also to be said that the overall size can easily be exaggerated <e> <s> i have noted the figures the noble baroness has given us for the amount of increase in cost and i should be interested to know what proportion of that would have to be paid out anyway in some form of supplementary benefit and the actual increase in the number of claimants <e>", "<cs> my lords we have reached that point in the debate where i think it becomes more difficult not to keep repeating things that other people have said <e> <s> on the other hand it is a debate and there is a way in which one wants to pick up points that have been made respond to them and perhaps make certain key points which are important to oneself in a way which may be heard differently <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i should answer that immediately because i do not have the passage in front of me and i ought to read it first before responding <e> <s> i believe my colleague may say something about it later <e>", "<cs> in short my lords the deregulation on weekdays and substantial tidying up on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat what the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham said earlier i do not know whether the noble lord was in the house then <e> <s> although the board of social responsibility gave its general support to the work of the jubilee trust it is not personally backing these proposals <e> <s> this pamphlet is a product of the trust <e> <s> it is not fair to make us responsible for these proposals and this is not the road down which we particularly want to go <e>", "<cs> my lords in cyril garbett described the housing situation in our country with million people in overcrowded or substandard accommodation as <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise first to the noble lords lord bottomley and lord elton for the fact that i cannot stay till the end of the debate <e> <s> your lordships will know that bishops try hard to clear their diaries when taking part in a debate but it is sometimes difficult and i did not feel that it was right on this occasion to override the engagement that i have this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords after listening to three such careful and substantial speeches i am sure that your lordships will agree that social security systems are about or are meant to be about the meeting of some very basic human needs and about the ways in which society attempts to do that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter asked whether the word <e>", "<cs> i do not think i agree with that because we need to spell it out quite clearly but i see the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister one or two questions which relate particularly to the question of extending or narrowing the grounds on which exemption can be made rather than dealing with the question on appeal <e> <s> from time to time the impression is given that there are a large number of pensioners who are waiting to exercise this so-called right to buy i feel that this cannot be so since it is normally not possible for a pensioner to secure a mortgage <e> <s> therefore we must be talking about a relatively small group of people who have acquired capital presumably since they became tenants eligible to hold property of this kind or they must have relatives in the background who are offering them financial help for the purpose of purchasing this property <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this opportunity to debate a matter of such fundamental concern to the whole country and i should like to thank the noble lord lord winstanley for his masterly opening speech <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that housing associations also have a very important part to play in relieving homelessness and that this international year would be a very good opportunity to develop their work still further <e>", "<cs> my lords towards the end of his speech the noble lord lord tordoff mentioned his unease about the proposed terminus at waterloo station and it is about that that i particularly wish to speak tonight <e> <s> waterloo station lies within the diocese of southwark and as a consequence i have been approached by local residents and local clergy to ask this house to look very carefully indeed at the likely consequences of bringing around per cent <e> <s> of the estimated passenger traffic to a single terminal in london <e> <s> in view of the very long list of speakers tonight i know that i must be as brief as possible <e> <s> much of the detail ought therefore to wait for the select committee stage provided that those responsible for the actual decisions and british rail in particular are there to answer questions <e>", "<cs> my lords in the board for social responsibility one of the main advisory boards of the general synod of the church of england gave evidence to the committee of the lord chancellors department on matrimonial causes procedure <e> <s> in the course of their evidence its members made a general point which i believe is of equal importance in considering this more recent report from the same source on family and domestic jurisdiction <e> <s> it was that procedures have an important effect on peoples understanding of the nature and importance of marriage and family life <e> <s> they said <e>", "<cs> my lords three debates in a year on the inner cities sounds a lot and like the weather some may feel that we have had rather too much of it <e> <s> nevertheless i welcome this opportunity to draw attention once again to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but i think there is a slight danger in this kind of conversation between noble lords that we might be giving the impression to those outside that there are houses or flats to be bought now for <e> <s> i am afraid that my recent experience of the opening of the reconditioned block of flats at acorn walk in rotherhithe is that if i remember rightly a one-bedroomed flat was going to be sold at somewhere around to <e> <s> we ought to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make one point as i may have been misunderstood <e> <s> i never mentioned yuppies in my speech and in case i am confused with whatever church leaders the noble lord was speaking about i must say that i never made any public utterance about yuppies <e> <s> i am fully aware of which houses they buy and that many of those houses are available from land which does not belong to the lddc <e>", "<cs> my lords i had come here tonight not intending to make a speech <e> <s> when i was having dinner one of your lordships asked which of you bishops is going to say something tonight <e> <s> i said i have no idea i am sure someone has been briefed <e> <s> i have done a little inquiring along the bench and discovered that nobody has <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first occasion on which i have followed a maiden speech and it gives me great pleasure to express the appreciation which i know will be felt by all your lordships for the careful and informed speech which we have just heard <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross is an experienced politician who as he told us represented the isle of wight where i think he still lives <e> <s> it is a part of the country which is seldom mentioned in this house and i hope that it will be mentioned again because personal experience often enlivens these debates <e> <s> i hope and i am sure that i speak for all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry <e> <s> it was a point worth trying to make <e> <s> but what i want to say and i am sure that i speak for all of us is that we look forward very much to the further speeches and contributions that the noble lord will be making in this house in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords it has gone down to six minutes <e> <s> well i had first to welcome the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> the immediate crisis of homelessness for families and children is centred on the south and london and is symbolised by the growing number in bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> what is needed here is an immediate injection of funds sufficient to bring back into use property which is in disrepair short-life housing and flats over shops <e> <s> local authorities and housing associations know how to do that given the right financial help and perhaps some technical and administrative support <e> <s> schemes could be submitted and a special section of the doe set up to give them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> i find it difficult to follow this line of argument when the local authorities in question have great difficulty in bringing those properties back into use because they need money to repair them in many cases <e> <s> will he deal with that point <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the per cent <e> <s> restriction each year is applied uniformly across the country when in fact in london homelessness is much greater and housing and land costs are also much greater whereas the sales of council houses and flats are fewer <e>", "<cs> within the diocese of southwark there are church schools lying within the five boroughs of the inner london education authority <e> <s> when the question of opting-out was proposed originally both for schools and for boroughs and then subsequently it was decided to abolish ilea itself the views of parents staff and governors of church schools were sought <e> <s> the vast majority of those consulted were and are entirely opposed to the abolition of ilea <e> <s> never have i received so many letters petitions and the like from church councils school governors ptas and many individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord basnett very much for enabling us to talk and think about this subject today <e> <s> i realise that i shall cover some of the same ground that has already been covered in all three speeches <e> <s> it is almost impossible to avoid this with such a wide topic but perhaps i can discuss it from a slightly different angle <e> <s> i found the speech of both the minister and the noble lord lord winstanley very interesting and helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords when some of the bishops first heard about this question we asked ourselves what lay behind it <e> <s> was the noble lord perhaps a friend of the honourable member for chesterfield in another place who is today proposing to disestablish the church of england <e> <s> our researchers produced no obvious connection and it seemed unlikely so we settled on the possibility that it was an oblique way of expressing disapproval either of one of us or possibly all of us but that i would have to wait for this evening in order to be sure <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment standing in the name of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and in my own name <e> <s> i wish to look carefully at one or two of the more general arguments which i think may be used to defend the proposed arrangements in the bill for application to this category of people <e>", "<cs> does the minister not agree that in this kind of case most of the people will never actually vote because they are only resident for a year in a place which is not their home so that argument hardly applies <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that the explanatory memorandum to this bill begins with a declaration of intent <e> <s> the bill is <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister is dealing with the transfer by a local authority of all its housing will he deal with the question of what will happen about the statutory duty to house the homeless <e> <s> will he come to that <e>", "<cs> there is one aspect of this matter that it is important to bring out <e> <s> i may have misunderstood the argument which i find difficult and confusing <e> <s> if i have read the proposed legislation correctly clause states that people who do not vote shall he taken to have accepted <e> <s> that provision puts this exercise into a different category because contrary to what is being said it means that urging people to vote may not necessarily be in the best interest of the applicant who proposes to take over the housing <e> <s> we must be clear that this is not a straightforward you win he loses proposition <e> <s> that is the point that many of us find difficult to understand and accept <e>", "<cs> i am nervous that we return to a possibly sterile argument between those who are anxious to break up what they see as the log-jam state of municipal housing in some parts of the country with all the difficulties that have arisen over management and so on and those who defend municipal housing for all the good reasons that the noble baroness has just described <e>", "<cs> it will probably be because we shall be using a property that does not have a tenant in it <e> <s> the homeless person or family is almost certainly in the category which cannot afford that sum <e> <s> if we are then going to say i am very sorry but housing benefit can only rise to a certain level and will not meet rents above that level what happens next <e>", "<cs> one important reason why people tried to get away from that solution to subsidise the building was that if one is not careful one would perhaps be subsidising people who did not need subsidy <e> <s> that is the free market argument <e> <s> i am only saying that i think the noble lord is right in terms of the situation in which we find ourselves but in theory following more freemarket philosophy it would be better more logical to subsidise only those who have need of subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take up your lordships time by repeating the arguments which have been so well put <e> <s> i should like to underline one point which picks up the point made by the noble lord lord ross that is there is a real sense among many local associations a number of which i have been speaking to in the past few weeks that their whole <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if we try to recover some sense of the totality of this bill and see this issue in relation to it <e> <s> in the earlier edition of the bill the preamble stated that the bill was <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to the questions and interesting comments of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i believe that he was just making a general comment about the fact that the scheme is unfunded <e> <s> however it is in capable hands those of the church commissioners and i do not believe that there is much anxiety within the ranks of the clergy about that fact <e> <s> we are grateful for the considerable amount of help that they provide for the large number of pensioners that there now are <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining that point <e> <s> i see the point <e> <s> i see that if one were to take that higher figure one would have a case <e> <s> i must say that it is a matter to which most of us have not given much thought <e> <s> i think that one could get into a discussion which would include the fact that the ultimate sources both of the pension and the stipend are in part the church commissioners and in part the giving of the present day <e> <s> there is a sense in which the more pensions are increased the less there is available for stipends <e> <s> there is a balance to be struck which would be part of the debate which we would have to have <e>", "<cs> my lords last may we debated the needs and problems of the mentally handicapped the mentally ill and their families <e> <s> i think it is a measure and a reminder of how urgent and important this matter remains that under the stimulus of the griffiths report we are debating it again <e> <s> it was emphasised then by many speakers that moving people from residential care into the community should not be seen as part of an economy drive <e> <s> it may even cost a little more in financial terms although the continuing lack of research and monitoring makes this a very difficult matter to assess accurately <e> <s> that is one of the points which i think we ought to be making on an occasion like this <e> <s> again we need to distinguish between the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill <e> <s> the mentally handicapped are sometimes described as those who have severe learning difficulties <e> <s> they will probably require care all their lives in a fairly stable context sometimes not that dissimilar from the physically handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for inserting myself into this debate unexpectedly at this late hour and i am sorry to do it <e> <s> unfortunately my name was not sent forward through the usual channels due to some oversight and i was unaware of the fact until i arrived in the house this afternoon <e> <s> one consequence of course is that i find myself in an unusual position on the list for a bishop <e> <s> it has been a salutary and i must say stimulating experience to listen to the considerable array of wisdom that has been deployed here this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all too easy to have a debate in which the charge that some people are worse off is countered by the charge that other people are better off and therefore it is argued the system must be delivering the goods <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to express the appreciation of many of us to the noble lord lord underhill for an opportunity to debate and think about this highly topical and difficult subject for which the little debate on rd may was a useful trailer <e> <s> despite the known predilection of clergymen for steam engines the psychological roots of which are probably better not explored i do not believe that bishops have any particular claim to wisdom where public or private transport is concerned <e> <s> but i am clear that this is a matter that has an enormous impact on the quality of peoples lives <e> <s> it has moved centre stage in any discussion of what it is like to live and work in london today <e> <s> as we have already heard it also has major economic consequences for business and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that while it is not possible to define poverty for some of the reasons that have already been given it is in practice necessary for any government to define minimum living standards in order to have any sum fixed for social security payments of one kind or another <e> <s> that being so it would be helpful to know on what basis these are calculated and what proportion of them are intended to maintain basic food clothing and heating and what proportion to cover the costs of more long-term needs to do with furnishings cookers and so <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the important statement which the noble lord has just made about the place of housing associations can he confirm whether it is true that in the past six months or so it has been extraordinarily difficult for the housing corporation to authorise new schemes because of the difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution to the problem of mixed funding at a time of high interest rates <e> <s> can he confirm whether it will be possible to alleviate that problem which is the clue to getting more starts made on the housing association side <e>", "<cs> my lords in his response to the debate last may on this subject the noble lord lord brabazon outlined the steps which the government were then taking to improve road conditions in london and which are further described in the report <e> <s> he then dismissed the need for a strategic authority for transport in london on the grounds that we want action and not bureaucracy <e> <s> however it is difficult to avoid the clear impression that the department of transport is actually being forced to set aside more and more resources in order to provide some kind of strategy for londons traffic <e> <s> good and comprehensive initiatives require good strategy as the noble lords lord tordoff and lord lucas have already pointed out <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the discussion on the amendment with great interest <e> <s> i am clear that the amendment as it now stands will not achieve what the movers clearly wish it to achieve <e> <s> it will certainly not achieve the statement about a concern which they have <e> <s> i was a little surprised to hear the noble lord lord ashbourne use the phrase legal medical and psychological problems when i suspect that as much as anything he is concerned about a moral issue <e> <s> it is important to state before the discussion ends that many of us are concerned with the fact that marriage is something which binds together the whole question of sexual relationships and parenthood <e> <s> that is something that we do not wish to see undermined by legislation <e> <s> anything which legislation seems to do in that way always leaves many of us concerned <e> <s> on the other hand as the noble earl lord halsbury said there is a place for a sense of reality about what is possible in our present day society <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support the principle behind this <e> <s> i should be grateful to hear whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor or the noble baroness lady hooper could define more sharply the words in a suitable condition <e> <s> in the normal usage of the english language that could not really be taken to mean with blue eyes or fair hair <e> <s> i share all the noble dukes anxieties about the wrong direction that this might take <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words as one of those whose name is attached to this amendment but from a slightly different position <e> <s> i am not what the noble and learned lord lord hailsham described as an absolutist <e> <s> if your lordships look at the voting lists in committee i voted on the other side <e> <s> therefore your lordships may wonder why i am speaking for this amendment at all <e> <s> the reason is that i believe that some of the arguments which needed to be heard and which are clearly emerging in this debate did not emerge earlier and i believe that they are very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with an apology to the house and to the minister <e> <s> i have to leave during the debate to take tonight a service which i cannot delegate to someone else or cancel at short notice <e> <s> i have never before had to leave during a debate but that is a recurring problem for us as bishops and i wanted to speak as the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury cannot be here and he was particularly anxious that one of his colleagues should take part in the debate <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will forgive me on this occasion <e>", "<cs> the hour is late and i realise that noble lords wish to go home but i think that the committee would like a short contribution from these benches <e>"]
