["<cs> my lords i beg to move that the health and social services and social security adjudications bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill marks another important step forward in the continued development of policies which we believe will improve the health and welfare of the population <e> <s> it contains provisions on health personal social services and social security adjudication matters and thus expands the whole range of issues for which i and my right honourable and honourable friends at the department of health and social security the scottish office and the welsh office are responsible <e> <s> may i briefly remind your lordships of the main elements of the policies which this government have vigorously promoted <e> <s> they have been the subject of debate in your lordships house on many occasions <e> <s> those which are reflected in this bill and which are central to our purpose today are first to encourage care in the community rather than in institutions for the elderly mentally ill mentally handicapped and disabled people secondly to provide the best possible services for children particularly by strengthening arrangements for the protection of those who are most vulnerable thirdly to streamline administration reduce bureaucracy and make all services for which we are reaponsible as efficient and therefore as effective as possible <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of your lordships and agreeable to the noble lord lord seebohm if he were to speak to his amendment now <e> <s> i had it in mind to reply to amendments nos <e> <s> and together although naturally <e> <s> i am in the hands of the committee to do otherwise if your lordships so wish <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give my noble friend the assurance for which he asks <e> <s> certainly the points which he raises will be carefully considered indeed the points that my noble friend raises are always carefully considered <e> <s> there is perhaps one point which i am able to deal with now and that is his anxiety about the possibility of guest houses or so-called guest houses escaping the net of this system <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the negotiations between the indonesians and the portuguese have been going on for a long time <e> <s> that is why we so much welcomed the move of the united nations secretary-general in this matter which was of course much more recent and we hope that this will lead the way to a solution <e>"]
