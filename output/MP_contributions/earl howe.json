["<cs> my lords i admit to a slight feeling of inferiority in speaking following my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth in view of his technical ability <e> <s> it may be because t am older that i have greater practical experience and because i have just had the unfortunate experience of driving over a couple of humps in a very small italian motorcar and i felt rather like evel knevel must feel when he gets airborne <e> <s> in a small machine with a short wheelbase it is not a pleasant experience going over humps <e> <s> i have also had experience of humps at brook-lands and sometimes they can leave a painful memory <e>", "<cs> i do not have the technical ability to answer that my lords and i should have thought it would depend on the individual motor cyclist and how he handles his machine <e> <s> in any event surely it is up to the government to give us some idea of the speed that is expected to be permitted to cross these humps <e>", "<cs> my lords there are other matters that need looking into such as the question of mopeds <e> <s> all the points that i am endeavouring to rub in raise questions which are bound to be in the minds of motorists and motor cyclists yet here we are having the bill being pushed through on a wednesday evening at a late hour with few noble lords present to hear what is being said <e> <s> i am sure many noble lords feel as motorists do that they would like more information <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a loud noise from a motor-cycle does not always mean that that motor-cycle is travelling at an excessive speed <e>", "<cs> after all the work that this house has been through during the past days this may seem to many of us to be rather an unimportant bill <e> <s> but to the motorist it is far from unimportant <e> <s> it is a very vital matter <e> <s> in this case because the interpretation of a hump can mean a depression i think we shall find that we are up against a great deal of opposition from road users <e> <s> they include motor cyclists and bicyclists <e> <s> it is possible for a motor cycle which has a very short wheel base and for a bicycle which also has a very short wheel base to jack-knife <e> <s> in other words by hitting a depression the front wheel turns in one direction while the back wheel goes straight on <e> <s> to my knowledge a cyclist leading a group of cyclists recently hit one of these things <e> <s> he has been in hospital for a short while because of being severely bruised <e> <s> he fell off his machine <e> <s> nothing justifies depressions of this nature <e> <s> they will only cause further danger to the road user <e> <s> i thoroughly support all that has been said by my noble friends who are supporting this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i refer to one particular organisation which my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> i was going to say that the trrl had referred to the damage done to vehicles which travelled over humps for a period of months <e> <s> i was reading about a person who had driven over humps for many months and now his vehicle needs new shock absorbers <e> <s> that could be attributed to general vehicle wear and tear or to the humps <e> <s> there is just a possibility that might happen <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> following upon the last remarks of the noble lord lord airedale it would be appreciated if the rac and the aa which are the two big motoring organisations looking after the interests of motorists particularly the rac could be put down in writing in some way at the top of the list <e>", "<cs> my lords my own experience and my view from what i have been told by my friends make me take the very opposite view from that of the noble lord lord porritt <e> <s> frankly i cannot understand why my noble friend lord nugent of guildford has tabled the motion at all we have debated this subject on several occasions and in my opinion we have come to a sensible decision against compulsion on each <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent is the recently elected president of rospa an association which wants to have all motorists strapped to their motor-cars <e> <s> i have great respect for my noble friend but he is also a vice-president of the rac whose clearly stated policy is opposed to compulsion until further research is carried out <e> <s> he must have had some difficulty in making up his mind to oppose the policy of his own club <e> <s> i feel he has been bulldozed by the propaganda which has been fairly heavy from rospa and the trrl <e> <s> they are by no means the deciding factor and incidentally i believe they were keen on the horrible humps to go with the potholes on our roads a subject we debated recently <e>", "<cs> i always thought that the noble lord lord houghton whom i respect very much was a peaceful man going to present his prizes at the flower shows <e> <s> instead of that to see him bouncing about in fury against the poor harassed motorist has really worried me <e> <s> does he not realise that from time to time a pedestrian is just as responsible for the death or injury of a motorist as the motorist himself <e>", "<cs> exceeding the speed limit is what one might call a technical offence <e> <s> this is something which i am bold enough to say possibly almost all of us have done from time to time and although we may strongly deny it frankly there are very few people who could honestly say that they have never exceeded the speed limit whether mph mph mph or mph <e> <s> we are all human beings and it is only human nature <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friend in his amendment one should realise that in lord strathcarron we have somebody who probably has more practical experience of motor-cycling than anyone else in your lordships house <e> <s> not only that he is a motoring journalist and a motor-cycling journalist so that anything he says is said with great experience and after very careful thought <e> <s> what i say will be very brief because the time is late and it would almost be repeating what my noble friend has already said <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> at last <e> <s> it is not often that i am last in a traffic queue <e> <s> but my noble friend lord nugent has been directing the traffic so very well and i am very grateful to him and to your lordships for enabling me to say a few words this afternoon <e> <s> thinking that i might not be able to speak i have been talking to the motoring correspondent of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that out of the many possibilities there is one very simple device which is known as the monsanto clear pass <e> <s> that is rather an unusual title but it is what it is called <e> <s> it definitely suppresses spray when fixed to the side of a commercial vehicle <e> <s> the spray comes out at the side and not at the back <e> <s> this enables an overtaking motorist of a commercial vehicle on a freeway or motor road such as we have in this country to be able to pass the vehicle with a clear road ahead <e> <s> will the noble earl look into this <e>", "<cs> my lords in the search for a solution over the years has the noble earl considered inquiring from the technical and engineering department of the royal automobile club about the possibilities of certain systems which could have been used many years ago <e> <s> i asked a similar question and i quickly say this before i am accused of making a speech out of it of my noble friend lord davies of leek many years ago during the passage of a transport bill and it has taken four or five years for an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that i am not the only member of your lordships house to welcome that part of the gracious speech which referred to criminal justice and the ways in which our courts are empowered to sentence convicted offenders <e> <s> changes in that area have been in gestation for some considerable time now and at the beginning of this year the government published their white paper <e>"]
