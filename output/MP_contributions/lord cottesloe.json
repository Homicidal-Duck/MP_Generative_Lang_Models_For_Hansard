["<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord the vice-chancellor of the university of london for initiating this debate and for developing his theme so clearly and so forcibly <e> <s> i suppose nearly everyone concerned in the administration of the health service would agree that whatever it merits the reorganisation of like the simultaneous reorganisation of local government was an expensive mistake <e> <s> developed from a green paper by mr kenneth robinson and brought into effect by a conservative government it was in general a bipartisan measure of entirely excellent intentions <e> <s> but in practice it resulted in the introduction of an additional administrative tier that in a service already short of funds ate up monies which should have gone to modernising and rebuilding the hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is intense and bitter opposition among those who live in the terraces of listed georgian houses known as the carburton triangle to the proposals for demolition and redevelopment <e> <s> is he aware that the full rehabilitation of these houses is feasible while redevelopment would cost rather more than the figures quoted by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed it is estimated by the local tenants association that it will cost more than twice as much and will provide little additional living accommodation <e> <s> is the minister further aware that even if the proposals for redevelopment go forward it would be perfectly feasible for the house in which flaxman who was the outstanding neo-classical designer and sculptor in this country lived for years to be preserved together with the adjoining houses on either side of it and in those circumstances will he encourage his right honourable friend to prevent this destruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very fortunate that it falls to me to be the first to congratulate the noble lady lady saltoun on a notable maiden speech <e> <s> it would perhaps not be accurate to describe her as a maiden lady <e> <s> she has made a valuable and constructive <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> it is of course a slightly clumsy arrangement that the appointment should be made jointly by two secretaries of state <e> <s> it would be simpler if the appointment were to be made by the prime minister <e> <s> the important aspect of this is that this would <e>", "<cs> with great respect to my noble friend on the front bench i disagree with almost everything he has said <e> <s> i hope that on consideration he will take the matter away and think about it and perhaps bring forward a corresponding amendment on report <e>", "<cs> what is the point of the government appointing trustees and then not trusting them <e> <s> they will not get the right trustees if they are not prepared to give them reasonable freedom of action on their own responsibility <e> <s> there is no point in keeping them on leading strings and i hope the government will think again about this <e>", "<cs> this is a point i raised on second reading and i am immensely grateful to my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton for introducing this amendment to give effect to it <e> <s> it will give great satisfaction to those concerned with the national art collections fund and the friends of the national libraries to have those institutions specifically named in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lordsi should like to support my noble friends amendment and i very much hope that the minister will accept it <e> <s> in the course of a long life i have served as chairman of no fewer than three of the bodies which the minister quoted when we last discussed the bill as having their chairman appointed by the prime minister the reviewing committee on the export of works of art the arts council and the tate gallery <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that there are real advantages in this arrangement <e> <s> the fact of prime ministerial appointment not only gives the enterprise a particular status which in practice means that those who administer it or who are concerned in its administration give it special care and attention but also the chairman can in wholly exceptional circumstances go direct to the prime minister to discuss with him some matter of principle which is of fundamental importance <e> <s> that i know because i did myself on one occasion have to do it <e> <s> these are real advantages and i hope that the government will feel able to accept my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very glad that the government themselves have introduced this amendment <e> <s> it is clear that an object which may be of no outstanding importance in one setting may in another context be entitled to pre-eminent status and that the degree of importance attaching to an object is not in itself absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that powerful arguments have been put forward in favour of this amendment that it is only an enabling amendment and that it can only be brought into effect by an order approved by parliament <e> <s> but there is another side to the coin <e> <s> if it is operated at all then it will probably become in practice the general rule <e> <s> the chairman of a public body in my experience and i have a little experience if he is unpaid has the real advantage that no political pressure from his minister can interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment of what is in the best interests of the enterprise <e> <s> that independence of judgment and action has at times real advantages <e> <s> i think that perhaps the house should consider that on the other side of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are two definitions in different parts of the bill it may be unnecessary but does it do any harm so long as they are identical which they are <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if the admiralty board had waited a few more days they might have received a substantially larger offer for the ship from the committee anxious to preserve her as the last capital ship in the royal navy <e> <s> that would have been beneficial to both the national finances and the national heritage <e> <s> in those circumstances can the noble lord tell the house what induced the board of admiralty not to wait a few more days <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain the house for more than a few moments <e> <s> these codes of practice are not and cannot be perfect <e> <s> we may think that they could be improved some of us in one way some in another but we have no power to amend them <e> <s> perhaps it is just as well thinking back over the past week or days that we have not <e> <s> we have only the options of accepting them or rejecting them as they stand <e> <s> it is a matter of these codes or no codes <e> <s> i hope even if those on the opposition benches choose to divide the house against accepting them that the house will accept them by a massive and decisive majority <e>", "<cs> my lords we live nowadays as it appears to an old man in a strange world of paradox <e> <s> we have revenue officials who have in the last two years received some per cent <e> <s> of increases in their salaries and have a security of tenure and the prospect of index-linked pensions not available to the ordinary citizen so discontented that they are busy inhibiting the treasury from receiving the monies from which their own salaries are paid <e> <s> we have responsible trade union officials and let me say that i do not include the noble lord lord scanlon in this i agreed with almost everything he said telling us that ballots are undemocratic and that the only democratic process is that people should stand up to be counted by which of course they really mean that they should stand up to be intimidated <e> <s> they cannot anyway really be counted in a mass meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at the public inquiry the inspector declared that it was outside his competence to judge of flaxmans significance in regard to the preservation of the house in which flaxman had lived and worked for years and that my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton who was replying for the government when the noble lord lord sudeley raised this question in january of last year said that the fact that an artist of great distinction had lived and worked in the house for years was irrelevant to the question of its preservation <e> <s> does the minister accept that view <e> <s> it seems to me to be absolute nonsense <e> <s> one might as well apply it to another georgian house of no special architectural distinction in which a succession of prime ministers have lived for most of this century <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the arts council grant was and in and the fact that it has now been increased to million shows that its real value has been continuously and very greatly increased and that this should be a matter not indeed for complacency but for greater satisfaction to everybody concerned <e>", "<cs> i shall follow the admirable example of the noble lord lord houghton and speak to all amendments together since they create or are designed to create a complete and coherent system but i hope perhaps that i shall not follow the noble lord at such great length <e> <s> the system which the noble lord lord houghton explained would consist of transferring to the local authorities responsibility for dogs in particular stray dogs <e> <s> it would alter the arrangements in respect of dog licences and it would create an army of dog wardens throughout the country <e> <s> i am quite sure that the proposed new clauses are put forward with the best possible intentions but i am equally sure that they are thoroughly misguided and i hope that the committee will not accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are much indebted to the noble lord lord houghton for his very clear explanation of this the first of the amendments that he and his noble friends have put down <e> <s> i think it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak to all the eight amendments together rather than speak to them individually that is amendments to if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not always that i can agree with the noble lord lord jenkins of putney but i am happy to say that on this occasion i can warmly and wholeheartedly support him <e> <s> this matter of the threatre museum is of course in no way a party political one it is one to which we should all wherever we may sit in the house give our strongest support <e>", "<cs> i have the greatest regard for my noble friend lord eccles and his views but on this matter i disagree with him <e> <s> i have a little experience having been for seven years a trustee of the tate gallery as the noble lord lord hutchinson is and the chairman of it <e> <s> and i have some experience of management in big public authorities <e> <s> i agree with almost every word spoken by lord hutchinson and i hope the committee will not accept the amendment <e> <s> i agree with all the speakers apart from the mover on that <e>", "<cs> that is so but i thought it might be convenient if i made this brief remark at this time <e> <s> the board of trustees should in my view not be a board consisting largely of what are in effect delegates but of independent persons who have in their own right the knowledge and experience of the matters with which the museum is concernesd <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord avon will not take exception to my having added those few words that is all i wanted to say on that aspect <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very warmly <e> <s> i think it is absolutely right <e> <s> indeed if the proposal by my noble friend lord eccles to introduce museum charges had included some provision of this sort i think it might have met a better fate <e>", "<cs> the committee was at pains in earlier discussions of the national heritage fund to ensure that it was possible and your lordships considered it very desirable that objects of special importance to the heritage when accepted for the nation are enabled to remain in the houses to which they belong and in which they have been accumulated <e> <s> surely the same applies in much greater degree to the objects in the armouries of the tower of london <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that the government might consider another variant and describe the royal botanic gardens as the royal botanic gardens at kew <e> <s> the words at kew would be exlanatory and not part of their title to which some exception might be taken <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to my noble friend lord eccles and to his experience i hope that the committee will not accept this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be misguided in principle and undesirable in practice <e> <s> i have two reasons for saying that <e> <s> first it would undermine the position of the director <e> <s> the director may or may not himself be a trustee i think that he should be but he is responsible to the board of trustees for the whole management of the institution collections and staff alike <e> <s> if when the board is considering his recommendations some of his keepers heads of departments who are and must be responsible to him as director can represent opposing opinions speaking as trustees and as equals that places him in an intolerable position <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief and i am glad that so many of your lordships are interested in the arts that we must all be brief <e> <s> i am a back number but i hope no one will doubt my lifelong devotion to the arts <e> <s> of course there never has been and never will be money enough to satisfy all the demands of those concerned to promote them <e> <s> what there is will always in the last resort depend not so much on what the government provide as on what those who are concerned and interested are willing and able by their enthusiasm and their own efforts to put into it in one way and another <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be very grateful to my noble friend lord fanshawe for raising a subject which is a matter of concern to all of us who are interested in the arts and in our heritage in this country <e> <s> it has also had the peculiar benefit of enabling us to hear two quite admirable maiden speeches from the noble earl lord munster and from my noble friend lord mcalpine of west green <e> <s> looking back over the years there has been constant anxiety and constant pressure on successive governments that not enough has been done to foster the arts and to preserve our great heritage from the past <e> <s> but in fact very much has been done and it would be churlish not to acknowledge the advances made especially in the difficult period of inflation since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that the belgrano was sunk for good and all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the boroughs concerned barnet and camden are not on speaking terms <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the real requirement now is not for a coin but for a or even coin <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how many more people are employed in this country now than were employed a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords this motion which has been set down by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney invites us to discuss two entirely different subjects support for the arts and the future financing of broadcasting <e> <s> i propose to say something briefly about the first but not to attempt to touch on the latter <e> <s> they are both subjects of great importance but neither is in any sense a party matter <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a marathon debate and i shall be as brief as i can <e> <s> i wish to develop only two aspects of the matter one a general point and the other a particular one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to say with what pleasure and interest i listened to the quite admirable maiden speech of the noble lord lord teynham <e> <s> it encouraged me to think that we may hope to hear him many times in the future <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for the assurances that he has given and <e>", "<cs> my lords if mr bristow has in fact been offered a knighthood he will have had a letter from the prime minister asking whether he was willing to accept one <e> <s> does he suggest that he has such a letter <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was whether mr bristow suggests that he had in his possession a letter from the prime minister asking whether he was willing to accept a knighthood <e> <s> if he had been offered one he would certainly have such a letter <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was so to speak born and bred on firearms and has devoted to their use a lifetime of interest and practice i wish to support most warmly what my noble friend lord swansea has said <e> <s> i can say this though he cannot he is one of the most brilliant and consistent rifle shots of his time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad for two reasons that the noble lord lord jay has moved this instruction <e> <s> i should like to support it <e> <s> i lived in hampstead for years and for most of the time within a few yards of the whitestone pond so i know the location well <e> <s> in the first place it seems to me a totally unnecessary bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord jay has told the house it proposes to set upon the top of hampstead hill in a conspicuous position what is described as a massive radio tower <e> <s> what is the purpose <e> <s> the purpose is for communication with the fire service and other services in an emergency <e> <s> those are the purposes for which the greater london council set up the existing mast <e> <s> it has served the purposes required for several years without criticism <e> <s> why cannot the existing mast continue those services <e>", "<cs> my lord we must be very grateful to my noble friend lord blake for raising this subject for the violent inflation of the current era in which important works of art can fetch not merely millions of pounds but tens of millions of pounds in the saleroom has revolutionised the whole picture of the maintenance of our national treasures <e> <s> i should like to say also with what great pleasure i listened to the noble viscount lord daventry in his maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that he may build on it and that we shall hear him often in the future <e>"]
