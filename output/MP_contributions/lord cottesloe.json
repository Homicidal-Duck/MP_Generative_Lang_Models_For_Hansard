["<cs> my lordsi should like to support my noble friends amendment and i very much hope that the minister will accept it <e> <s> in the course of a long life i have served as chairman of no fewer than three of the bodies which the minister quoted when we last discussed the bill as having their chairman appointed by the prime minister the reviewing committee on the export of works of art the arts council and the tate gallery <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that there are real advantages in this arrangement <e> <s> the fact of prime ministerial appointment not only gives the enterprise a particular status which in practice means that those who administer it or who are concerned in its administration give it special care and attention but also the chairman can in wholly exceptional circumstances go direct to the prime minister to discuss with him some matter of principle which is of fundamental importance <e> <s> that i know because i did myself on one occasion have to do it <e> <s> these are real advantages and i hope that the government will feel able to accept my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very glad that the government themselves have introduced this amendment <e> <s> it is clear that an object which may be of no outstanding importance in one setting may in another context be entitled to pre-eminent status and that the degree of importance attaching to an object is not in itself absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that powerful arguments have been put forward in favour of this amendment that it is only an enabling amendment and that it can only be brought into effect by an order approved by parliament <e> <s> but there is another side to the coin <e> <s> if it is operated at all then it will probably become in practice the general rule <e> <s> the chairman of a public body in my experience and i have a little experience if he is unpaid has the real advantage that no political pressure from his minister can interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment of what is in the best interests of the enterprise <e> <s> that independence of judgment and action has at times real advantages <e> <s> i think that perhaps the house should consider that on the other side of the argument <e>"]
