learned lord would never wish to mislead the house <e> <s> i have it on the authority of the senate and the law society that their members who are on that committee are in no way representatives of either the senate or the law society they are merely their nominees at the request of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the intervention from the noble lord lord airedale has reduced the atmosphere by giving an interval of time which all your lordships would want in these circumstances <e> <s> there is much i should have loved to say in answer to the noble and

refer again to the pre- category in which quite obviously this humble noble lord has no personal interest whatsoever <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned that there have been discussions on this matter in this house and that the feeling of the house was very clear <e> <s> he mentioned that the matter would be under consideration and that legislation might take place <e> <s> would the noble earl have in

my humble voice to the delightful one of the noble baroness and say that this absence of particularisation does worry many practitioners in the law who will be called upon to advise under this act <e>

meant to come within this provision or not <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether your lordships will forgive me if i address the committee for just a moment in order to elaborate the point that i tried to make and which the noble lord has just sought to answer <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the clause as now worded does not even include the words unfairly or unreasonably in order to give some guidance to the citizen and to those who are trying to interpret the act <e> <s> if one takes his reply literally that it is extremely difficult for various reasons to give definitions beforehand will he consider before the report stage at least introducing into this clause words which colour or define the conduct in order that people may know better what it is that this clause hits at by way of definition of uncompetitive practices <e>", "<cs> it does not say unfairly or unreasonably <e>", "<cs> does the minister really put that to the committee as being an appropriate answer to the very lucid way in which my noble friend lord jacques put this matter <e> <s> first of all are we to have a new doctrine of the infallibility of directors general whoever they may be and can it not be conceived that a director wrongly has a reference before the commission <e> <s> is it really seriously suggested by the minister for whom we have a profound respect and whose utterances are usually very serious to those of us who know the court procedures and commission procedures that proceedings are prolonged by an argument over costs <e> <s> one knows perfectly well that such matters are dealt with only at the end of the commissions proceedings and then a short submission is made as to the unreasonableness of the proceedings having been brought before the commission <e> <s> i am sure that within a matter of a few seconds the commission could make up their minds <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene again because the minister was good enough to say that he would consider the matter again and because too he directed a question to me which i ought to answer <e> <s> surely the minister is being rather pessimistic about the result of matters referred by the director to the commission when he says that he thinks that possibly in half of the cases there would be an argument about their being unreasonably brought before the commission that implies that at least one-half of the cases before the commission would be unsuccessful <e>", "<cs> quite obviously this application for expenses cannot be made unless the commission has found that the case has been wrongly brought <e> <s> that is why i said that one imagines if the minister is correct in his forecasts of the care that the director will be taking that there will be only a small percentage of cases where the commission finds that it was wrong for the matter to have been brought before them <e> <s> i do not want to delay the committee but i feel that where a citizen is brought before a tribunal whoever be the party who does it and we live in a democracy in the event of it being found that that citizen was unnecessarily brought there wrongly brought there there ought to be the right of recovery of at least expenses so that the citizen who in certain cases may be in very poor cirumstances has the right to recovery if the commission think it appropriate <e>", "<cs> does the minister realise in these last observations the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state not agree that he might at least have disclosed an interest when indulging in his eulogy of our foreign policy <e> <s> does he not also agree that adding political strings to aid is not going to add to our standing especially in the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords in suggesting that the arts in the form of david seem to be facing in the minister a goliath will he take it for granted that i am not necessarily calling him a philistine <e> <s> will the minister not agree that a very special case exists with the subsidised theatre as against the theatre as a whole <e> <s> is he aware and here i declare an interest as a member of the board of the national theatre that the subsidised theatre is contributing so much to our national cultural heritage and is being severely handicapped at the moment by this heavy vat <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble and learned lord not only for his courtesy but for the clarification which now appears which i find eminently satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will sympathise with somebody who has to follow a plain and simple man in the street but i do so apologising on his behalf for the fact that my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey is not able to be in the house today he wanted very badly to speak to many of the amendments on report but urgent business has kept him away <e> <s> i mention his name particularly in regard to this because he was among others extremely concerned about the power that was given under the clause as originally drafted for redetention if cause were shown and if a justice so certified <e> <s> the amendment obviously meets the objection that was taken to the clause in committee and on second reading and i know that my noble and learned friend would have wanted in his usual gracious terms to have thanked the noble earl for the amendment and for the way in which he has dealt with the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i dare try to help the noble earl and possibly other noble lords who are worried about this clause <e> <s> if instead of helping him i say something with which he disagrees i am sure he will say so <e> <s> is not the answer in regard to this clause as follows <e> <s> if evidence comes out regarding a wrongful use of procedures as set out in the clause then the noble earls

learned lord lord wheatley as well as of course of my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey and for that i am obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that the pessimistic note upon which the noble lord lord foot ended his very effective words to the house will not prove to be justified <e> <s> there is every reason i would submit why the amendment which my noble friends and i support

passage which appears on page of the second report <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is kind to give way but really it was not my own report that i was giving about the type of machine that could be used <e> <s> the thomson committee went into this matter very deeply and this is what they said on page <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i was rather surprised when the noble lord lord foot took as an example of the use of a five-year period and an affirmative resolution the question of the abolition of capital punishment <e> <s> this was a step which was taken by our legislature in order to do away with something which we had known for a very long time and to see whether in fact we were doing something which was morally right and might have the same sort of deterrent effect as capital punishment might or might not have had <e> <s> by clauses to of this bill we are doing no such thing <e> <s> we are not abolishing that which we have known we are initiating that which we have not yet known and we are doing it on the basis of recommendations soundly reached in so many respects after a lot of consideration by a committee whose words the noble earl opposite if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords this may give me a speedy opportunity of thanking the noble and learned lord for what he has said in regard to clause and the revised thinking of the government in regard to it <e> <s> this obviously meets a great number of the points of principle we tried to raise from these benches at the committee stage and indeed on second reading <e> <s> we are obliged to him and now it will merely be a question from our point of view of dealing with the fundamental matters of clause as we hope to do in our various amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that again i rise to try to persuade your lordships and to move the noble and learned lord the lord advocate from what he has just said especially in view of the fact that a very learned law lord has just spoken against this amendment <e> <s> i still feel with the greatest possible respect to the thomson committee and to what has been said by the noble lord lord foot that the attitude of the accused has been ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords having at least scored a single if not a boundary i find myself so full of rejoicing that immediately upon the terms mentioned by the noble and learned lord i ask leave to

minister has not answered the point of amendment no <e> <s> because she intends to do so when i formally move it <e> <s> if so of course i have no complaint <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be tidier in view of the question which was addressed to my noble friend lady stewart if i shortly reply to the points made by the minister when amendment no <e> <s> is movedbut it will not be in the course of a long speech that i shall do so <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to deal with the point made by lord alexander so that the committee should not be confused <e> <s> i did not suggest and would not suggest that the duties and powers in regard to specific schools in respect of grounds or whatever it may be should be laid before parliament by regulation <e> <s> i was merely saying that the regulations should contain a little sentence which would be clear to everybody stating that where the grounds are in the ownership and care of the school it is for the governors as part of their duties and powers to deal with them <e> <s> there is no difficulty on this score <e> <s> the desirability of uniformity is greater than the small difficulty of using wording to indicate that where these matters fall within the <e>", "<cs> my lords only so that the house should feel that there would be no possibility of unnecessary delay having heard the noble lord say that two ministers who were named in the previous debate were now consulting with the prime minister and since the only alteration would be that the prime minister would have to consult with the ministers could they merely rearrange their seats and get on with the job <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add <e>", "<cs> may my riposte be as brief as the speech i made in moving the amendment <e> <s> it is wonderful for legislators to be able to refer back to other clauses and subsequent clauses and procedures under other actsbut those who have to carry out this act and those who wish to read and know what their rights are want to look at a section which is a comprehensive section <e> <s> if this happens to be covered either directly or indirectly by other sections or other legislation is there any harm at all if it be repeated in this clause in order to make the matter transparently clear <e>", "<cs> may i put it the other way and then withdraw the amendment unless anybody else wishes to address the committee <e> <s> if the noble lord would be good enough to take this back between now and report stage and if he is convinced by the reasoning of the parliamentary draftsman that this is otiose and comes back at report stage and says so i shall naturally have to give serious consideration to what he then says <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the great advantages of listening to two speeches which make your points far better than you are able to do is that you can then sit down and say i propose to divide the committee and i do <e>", "<cs> the minister has behaved with his usual courtesy <e> <s> indeed i am inspired looking at the right reverend prelates opposite to quote the prayer blessed be the lord by day and blessed be the lord by night at this time but obviously having heard his explanations though they have not if i may say so quite satisfied me i will not at this stage press these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments of the minister on the first amendment and i do not propose to carry that discussion any further <e> <s> with regard to the second i feel comforted that he too shared the same apprehensions <e> <s> it there <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to supplement what my noble friend has said in summarised form <e> <s> the clause deals with premises and many of us who have been connected with voluntary <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point i was trying to make if the noble lord lord james would permit a further intervention so that he could deal with the matter <e> <s> i was going to ask him whether he felt he was on a rather dangerous course bearing in mind the views that i know he so sincerely holds <e> <s> if it be a fact that in the private sector of education there are sufficient teachers to whom the bright pupils can be sent whether it be to learn chemistry because in the schools in which they are no chemistry is taught or mathematics or whatever is not the logical end to the course which he is pursuing one which i should have thought he would not advocate <e> <s> namely <e> <s> that in order to get proper education for the nation the private sector which has these teachers should be incorporated in the public sector and then there would presumably be places and teachers available in order to satisfy the needs of the brighter pupils <e> <s> i must say that i should have thought that was not a course in logic that the noble lord was advocating but is not that the logical conclusion of his argument <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient in view of what the minister has said if i now move amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name <e> <s> through the courtesy of the noble lord lord wigoder and the noble lord lord vaizey neither of whose faces however tired i see before me it was arranged that my amendment should come first <e> <s> the reason for it is that mine is an omnibus amendment in the sense that it deals with professional grants and does not single out either solicitors or barristers <e> <s> may i at once state an interest in at least one of those professions <e>", "<cs> we are <e>", "<cs> i recognise the lateness of the hour but i thought i was asked to deal with amendment no <e> <s> as it is in the group of amendments <e>", "<cs> and i am trying to do that <e> <s> it would save a great deal of time if i were not interrupted needlessly <e> <s> during the early hours of this morning we heard a great deal about the need to encourage bright pupils <e> <s> some people <e>", "<cs> i cannot say how disappointed i am at that reply especially in view of what dr boyson said during the committee stage in another place <e> <s> it is so surprising because when we were discussing the question of handicapped children and special schools about which so many of us felt so deeply and i am sure she did too i can remember the minister saying that it was really impossible to put a provision in a bill which would last for many years and make it only a transitional item <e> <s> now we hear that although this is going into a bill which is supposed to last for very many years the noble baroness is not prepared to include a provision even though it may only have to take effect in a few years <e>", "<cs> i think it is absolutely excusable that on friday of this week noble lords speeches are made and are not necessarily understood <e> <s> therefore i make no complaint whatsoever when i remind the minister that the first point i made is one that he has not dealt with at all <e> <s> that is the question of charging adults over the age of for the supply of this uniform instead of as is the present position charging the parents <e> <s> i understand perfectly i think we are all a litle tired that the minister may not have understood that that was the reason i gave for my amendment <e>", "<cs> i dare not try your lordships patience too much <e> <s> i can only say that we are talking about an education bill <e> <s> i in the course of my not too successful education learned the art of precis and i hope i said in three sentences precisely what the minister said this clause means and what the present practice is <e> <s> my question still remains unanswered but i do not want to test your lordships patience any more <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for that explanation on subsection which relates also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when

observations that came from the noble lord lord wigoder a few moments ago <e> <s> although i always have the greatest respect for his comments i am afraid that he is at least responsible for my wearying your lordships for a couple of minutes <e> <s> it is absolutely right that one should praise as the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack did the learned judge who delivered the very lucid judgment in this case mr justice woolf <e> <s> it is quite right that one should praise the secretary of state for the dignity and gentility of his apology to the nation at large <e> <s> it is right that one should praise the local authorities for being generous in their hour of triumph for being conciliatory and for being sensible in the circumstances <e> <s> it is equally right that in circumstances such as these and i do not level any blame but merely express sorrow that such things should occur there should be a bill of this kind before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to add one further point which i believe has not been adumbrated so far <e> <s> it is this at committee stage i remember the minister agreeing with me at least i think he did that it was desirable that there should not be automatic political appointments of governors <e> <s> i think we said that at committee stage without any party feelings at all because it is known on all sides that political parties in some areas are in the habit of inviting people who are members of the political parties to serve as governors if they would like to or they put forward other nominations <e> <s> in saying this i am not decrying the many worthy governors who are put forward by political parties be they conservative labour or liberal <e> <s> but all too often it is a question of we are expected to nominate three or four people to this school <e> <s> who can we think of and who is prepared to volunteer <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to what the noble baroness the minister has said i bee leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at once take up the points which were so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk was kind enough to quote my speech at committee stage on an amendment similar to this and i am obliged to her for quoting the better parts of my speech and not the worse parts <e> <s> i failed to see the logic of lord belsteads reply to me and i fail to see the logic of what the minister is now saying <e> <s> i could understand it if the government in thinking about this matter and knowing what a crying need there is for nursery classes had come back and said we do not wish to discourage schools from opening new nursery classes and therefore as from this date if there are new nursery classes opened they shall not be subject to <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house my lords i make only one comment in answer to what the minister said <e>", "<cs> i said by leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that information and i apologise to the house if i offended <e> <s> may i therefore put this in the form of a question <e>", "<cs> again i am corrected and i will get it right this time my lords <e> <s> before the noble baroness sits down and she has obviously not sat down yet may i ask her to consider the fact that her whole argument has been based as it was before on the closure significantly affecting the nature of the school <e> <s> would she not agree that the plea that is being made is to save nursery classes from extinction without having to go through the clause procedure where they may not form a significant part of the school <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that nobody thought this was supposed to be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i specifically said and i would have hoped that the noble baroness would have heard me in my introductory remarks that the discretion that was being left to local authorities was very much a part of the case which was being made by the government in respect of so many clauses of this bill <e> <s> the purpose of my amendments has i hope been achieved in that it has enabled a discussion to take place as to what really the discretion and powers of local education authorities are when it comes to the question of assisted places <e> <s> i am delighted that the discussion has therefore arisen in your lordships house which has clarified matters although many of us may feel that enough discretion is still not being given to local education authorities in regard to these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said in regard to an earlier amendment i moved that i resembled a wrecker would she at least give me the credit for being responsible for one small brick in the unsatisfactory edifice of the education bill <e> <s> because this is a point that i tried to make in the early hours of the morning <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin who made three attempts half asleep at the time and very understandably so failed to understand my point and saw no reason to amend at all <e> <s> i am deeply grateful for the further consideration given to the matter and i hope my description as a wrecker will not last until half past eleven tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords those who do not have an esoteric interest in the companies bill now before this house in regard to the amendments of the commons may have wondered at the calm which has fallen upon the house so far interrupted by a few ripples from the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> may i immediately say that some of the calm is now going to cease to exist because we are coming to clauses in this bill which have nothing to do with the eec directive requirements as such and which relate to matters which were debated in this house at the committee stage when the opposition had some very definite views which it ventured to place before this house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not quite sure that i am clearer about the situation <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord has done his best to help me and for that i am grateful <e> <s> however this is so important that i would beg him unless he thinks that i am merely repeating myself and requiring him to repeat himself to deal with the specific question that i raised because i thought that it would interest the house <e> <s> could he please envisage the situation under subsection of an employee who was also a shareholder in the company <e> <s> could he envisage circumstances in which within the rules or exceptions of <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house it will be a very short intervention <e> <s> i must confess still to be in grave doubt but having regard to what the minister has said and i am sure that he and his advisers have given this matter the greatest of consideration i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords some general observations have been made in introducing this part of the bill and i feel that on behalf of my noble friends and myself i cannot allow them to pass without making our position quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it would meet with the convenience of the house if the noble lord proceeded in that way <e> <s> we can always rely on ministers to point out whether any amendment that they move on which there is not an amendment is other than a purely textual or slight one <e> <s> so far as i and my noble friends are concerned i think this is a most convenient procedure which will lead to the expediting of business <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord turns to another point i wonder whether he will permit an intervention <e> <s> he said that i would no doubt agree with him in a proposition that i thought he was putting before the house namely that certain directors are incarcerated abroad for certain offences <e> <s> i do not know to which directors the noble lord is referring <e> <s> i learned only a few days ago that one of them had been released <e> <s> there is no need to mention names in this house <e> <s> if however the noble lord is trying to associate me or my friends with the suggestion that we ought to try to protect people who have breached the laws of a foreign country i want to dissociate both myself and my friends from this immediately <e> <s> i do not know what point the noble lord was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give an example to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has brought a breath of fresh and clean air into the house <e> <s> i was wondering what sort of atmosphere we were walking into before he did so but he has done it and i will not take any more advantage of the point <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was specifically related to remuneration <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot see for the moment how the question of the remuneration of a director could in any way be adverse to the interests of any company in regard to its directors operations abroad but no doubt i shall be enlightened by the noble lord lord lyell when he comes to deal with a different sort of point from the one he was trying to make before <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that the noble lord lord lyell would answer the amendment in full <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i had better save the government from further embarrassment by merely saying that i propose to divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord talks about looking at this matter in due course and he regarded it as a matter which certainly ought to be looked into for the reasons that were advanced so cogently by my noble friend <e> <s> did he mean in the course of this bill or did he mean in the course of time <e> <s> if he meant in the course of this bill he will make everybody happy <e> <s> however if he meant in the course of time then we may be postponed to eternity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as an amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i imagine that there is complete agreement on all sides of the house as to the necessity for legislation to deal with insider dealings <e> <s> i also imagine that there is no difference of opinion within the house on whether insider dealings should be made criminal offences <e> <s> the opposition previously took that view and we agree with the government now <e> <s> if one is to legislate in regard to insider dealings and to legislate properly one must be quite sure that those who have cast upon them the duty of deciding whether or not a prosecution would lie under the clauses of a bill should have their task made clear and their duty made equally clear where certain facts emerge <e> <s> those responsible for initiating a prosecution cannot be expected to protect the public by bringing charges where they are given a completely impossible task <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as amendment a that this house do disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a method or lodging a protest as to the manner in which yet another important clause in this has been dealt with by the government <e> <s> i made a general observation at the very commencement when these parts of the bill were being dealt that as a result of the use of extraordinary speed which need not have happened if the government had dealt with this matter as we wanted them to do last july there are half-baked unexamined measures coming before this house in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard the protest from the opposition and i shall merely say therefore that i ask the leave of the house to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as an amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> i hope to be brief <e> <s> with your lordships permission it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak to amendments nos <e> <s> d to g <e> <s> i have moved these amendments in order once again to draw the attention of the house to the half-baked way in which some of these new clauses have come before the house from the other place <e> <s> perhaps i can use the examples that are incorporated in these amendments <e> <s> i do not suppose that it is necessary for any of us to legislate in the purest possible prose but unless the noble viscount for whom we have so much respect wishes to go down in some trenchard thesaurus of the english language with a certain amount of shame he will accept at least one of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention is carried out <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to ask the house to bear with me yet once again i promise it will be for only a short time to listen to an example of the manner in which this serious bill has come before the house from the commons and of the rush and the unpreparedness with which this bill is drawn <e> <s> your lordships may or may not agree with me but this is a clause which imposes for the first time so far as i am <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will read from the beginning of the new clause he will see that the words are and who has any of these qualifications <e> <s> the or is at the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord is content to allow <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no opportunity of checking what the minister has said but i am quite sure that if he has said it on advice it has been said very correctly <e> <s> on that basis i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down did he notice that the heavens themselves were rather amazed at his speech and sounded forth their reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that one of the problems that may face those who wish otherwise to indulge in concerted action is that some countries may suffer a fatal blow if they are deprived of oil <e> <s> in these circumstances will concerted action mean a sacrifice by those countries who can manage to dispense some of their surplus and thus aid those who are prepared to agree with this action and who might otherwise suffer the sacrifice i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary in certain circumstances to thank a noble lord who tables a motion for having done so <e> <s> i can well understand that noble lords on the government benches did not want to commence their speeches by adopting that custom <e> <s> however i wish to thank my noble friend lord peart for having tabled this motion and for the speech which he made in support of it <e> <s> with the charm that makes him so popular a figure in this house the noble earl lord ferrers referred to your lordships house as being a very civilised place in which one can enjoy speeches even if one does not agree with them a place in which speeches are accepted with intelligence and courtesy despite their possibly vitriolic political content <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to address the house very briefly and this i promise on one point which may meet with some agreement having regard to the debate which has occurred so far and on one point which may be deemed to be highly eccentric but which nevertheless i must express because i believe in it very sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the foreign secretary aware that reports have also appeared in the <e>", "<cs> i was interested my lords <e>", "<cs> that too my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin has got a felicity and clarity of phrase which makes local government the poorer and national government the richer when he assumes responsibilities as he has this evening <e> <s> if only words could move mountains and indeed if only words could move transport and people the noble lord lord bellwin would be possibly one of the most effective in this century of those who have dealt with transport bills in this house

as the noble lord lord lloyd of <e>", "<cs> lord bellwin <e> <s> i do apologise <e> <s> maybe i hoped that it would be bell-lose on this occasion that made me get his name wrong <e> <s> he knows that i have enough affection for him whatever his name may be <e> <s> my lords in regard to part iii the matter was put very clearly and possibly your lordships will find it a simple issue that i try to put now <e> <s> the history of british rail and to some extent that of the national freight corporation was a mixed-up mess by way of a provision of funds in order that pensions might be payable <e> <s> it was a mix-up before nationalisation and the mix-up was continued after nationalisation by virtue of the fact that the british rail pensions people were required to pay monies into the british rail board and before then to the british rail companies for use by those companies at very low rates of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to put it on the academic basis that it is a question of retrospective legislation <e> <s> i should prefer to put it on this basis because i believe this is the practical way although i know that the noble lord lord morriss advice to me was intended to be helpful to my point and therefore i do not push aside his assistance discourteously <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way for one moment before he leaves the subject of the national freight corporation <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to be discourteous to the noble lord tonight of all nights but i think that writing to me however courteous that may be on his part would not afford the information at second reading to the rest of the house <e> <s> i think it might be better if he were able to give that information now to the whole house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is very kind to give way again <e>", "<cs> before that possibly inevitable course takes place may i address myself to the comments just made by the noble minister <e> <s> i am sure that the committee would agree that it is a wrong and certainly foolish thing to introduce into an act of parliament something so uncertain that it is not capable of practical interpretation <e> <s> if somebody does it i am afraid that they must be accused of a rushed job even if the rushed job has taken hours to achieve <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would forgive me if i extract from something he has just said the words that appear to be an understanding with the insurance companies <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for the usual courtesy which he showed in saying that this matter will be further discussed <e> <s> it is only upon that basis that i ask him to consider something which i do not think he has considered in his reply <e> <s> first it is a very nice picture to paint of those who operate transport that they would not dream of getting the advantage of an express service which means that they would thereby be de-licensed or would not require a licence and would therefore not wish to think in terms on any way in which they could surreptitiously obtain that advantage <e> <s> i am sure that that applies to all the transport operators known to the noble lord lord bellwin but some of us who have knowledge of other transport operators are in a more unfavourable position than he is and we would not put it past them if i may put it in that brief way <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will not at all wish to oppose the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> the only reason why i rise is to ask a question since a definition may have escaped me <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will not wish vague words or phrases that could be misunderstood to appear in a schedule which they were about to approve <e> <s> the amendment refers to meeting <e>", "<cs> it is with some heartburning that i find that i have to differ from the noble lord on what he regards as a simplification of the bill <e> <s> it may be a simplification for the purposes of codification and draftsmanship but i do not think that is the sole consideration that will be in the mind of the committee <e> <s> we are dealing in this bill with a list of offences for which members of the public may be brought before a court and in respect of which they may have convictions in respect of which they may be fined and in respect of which as a result of the convictions they may lose a licence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord could not have been more gracious <e>", "<cs> i should like to tempt the noble lord the minister to agree to this amendment and not to continue any argument <e> <s> i hope that i may persuade him in one sentence before he rises by quoting the noble lord lord bellwin when he was dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord said then i made a note of it and he will forgive me i hope if i use it on a future occasion <e>", "<cs> i do it now <e>", "<cs> may i add a slightly new thought to this debate especially in view of what was said by the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> there is a new onus in regard to the granting of licences <e> <s> the new onus is not upon somebody to prove that it is in the interests of the public <e> <s> the new onus is that one has to prove that it is against the interests of the public for the licence to be refused <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether at some stage during this evening the government will be prepared to admit that their judgment could be fallible <e> <s> it would be a very touching exhibition of humility and one that i think the opposition and possibly noble lords wherever they may sit might find rather welcome <e> <s> we are not tonight debating the governments philosophy because as my noble friend lord underhill made very clear this evening and i hope we both made clear when we addressed your lordships house on second reading that philosophy through the process of democracy is the one that has to rule in this bill <e> <s> we accept that <e> <s> what we are trying to do in committee is to see whether there can be proper safeguards to ensure that that philosophy has the right effect for the travelling public and for those public operators who of necessity and for the benefit of the travelling public have to operate on non-economic routes <e>", "<cs> the committee has been treated to another unequivocal example of the governments philosophy and i will not waste the time of the committee by arguing about it <e> <s> i only propose to argue about the meaning of the english language and to see whether the noble lord is able an answer this question in the light of his philosophy <e>", "<cs> i believe that i speak for my noble friend lord underhill who moved this amendment when i say that if the government would accept the amendment with those words added i am sure that we would regard it as a positive contribution to this bill because the language would be positive and everybody would know where they stood <e>", "<cs> on precisely the same basis as was agreed between the noble lord and myself on behalf of the opposition i propose to say nothing more <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in such a helpful observation from the minister of which there have not been too many this evening although each time he answers he does it with such grace but the noble viscount lord simon was kind enough to assist us on these benches before and i wonder whether with the agreement of the minister and so that there is no misunderstanding i may endeavour to answer his question and then the minister may see whether he agrees with my answer <e>", "<cs> i do assure the noble lord that i could never do anything as unkind as that nor would i be intellectually capable of doing it so far as he is concerned <e> <s> i would merely pose to him the rather interesting question as to whether he would describe the noble minister opposite giving way to a point of the opposition as a special occasion or a special event <e>", "<cs> i think that your lordships noticed earlier that the government were very interested in this bill being extremely clear and that it should not contain superfluous words which were capable either of being dealt with in regulations or which were unnecessary in any event <e> <s> i shall not repeat the arguments in regard to paragraph <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i was not endeavouring to defy him <e> <s> i was not endeavouring to prove that white was black <e> <s> i was merely endeavouring to help the committee <e> <s> it may be that my view is a wrong one <e> <s> it is a view that i respectfully put forward to the committee without any pomposity at all <e> <s> it was not a question of saying whether or not the traffic commissioners can decide what is a special event <e> <s> nor was it an accusation that the traffic commissioners would either refuse or grant if they had such an application before them <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient in what may be the closing hour of todays session of the committee if i too put a question to the minister not for answer today but in case he may care to look at it <e> <s> i have not had the opportunity if i may be very frank with the committee to do any research upon this <e> <s> as a matter of fact the point occurred to me only while i was listening to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth in regard to his point <e> <s> but i observed that clause says that a road fund licence may be revoked or suspended <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that is obviously what i meant <e>", "<cs> also before the noble viscount resumes his seat my lords will he allow me to take advantage of the invitation he gave that we should endeavour to follow the processes of thought of the secretary of state <e> <s> may i ask him a question related to one process of thought which is connected with industrial relations and psychology <e> <s> if part of the success of mr macgregor i repeat part of the success is to be measured by the manner in which he manages to close plants and persuade people that it is necessary for them to become redundant does he think it is a suitable atmosphere for negotiation and persuasion that the closure of plants and redundancy will mean for employees a loss of money whereas for the gentleman concerned if it is part of the success by which he is measured it will be a gain of money <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether i am under a misapprehension and if i am would he please forgive me for this <e>", "<cs> in order to prove the complete liberty which on matters of this kind is cast upon the benches on which i have the honour to sit may i immediately rise to say that great as is my respect for my noble friend lord underhill i rise to oppose his amendment <e> <s> i do so with the history of this matter in mind and your lordships having heard recounted this afternoon yet once again the events that have led to this tragic episode may i merely remind your lordships of precisely what has occurred already at the united nations and at the international court of justice and indeed the dates on which these things occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an undertaking that in considering the future of the inner london education authority which has had such a very fine history in the educational world political considerations will not be in the ministers mind only educational ones <e>", "<cs> i hope that in the course of todays deliberations noble ministers opposite will find occasion to admit arguments which appear sound and not then succeed their tribute to the soundness of the arguments by that fatal word however which the noble minister has just used <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could tell us in view of the way in which this house and another place have been treated by the government of examples of economy which on this side of the house we welcome where efficiency is not impaired and where administration is improved <e>", "<cs> i will not trouble the committee for long and i hope i will not repeat any point which has already been made <e> <s> as one who has always been a lover of local government i must say that i listen with deep respect to anything that a colleague of mine and a very worthy colleague of mine the noble lord lord bellwin has to say on the subject <e> <s> i regard him as such an expert that indeed i would hope that the words that he has uttered this morning will be given in evidence to the inquiry that we were discussing at question time namely that involving the inner london education authority because i regard his comments on the division of functions as being so pertinent that i am sure the government will be most interested in his observations on what happens when functions are divided and art not looked after by one authority which can plan the matter with some amount of competence <e> <s> but having dived away and dealt with that point with a twinkle in my eye and having observed an accompanying twinkle in the eye of lord bellwin may j revert to the question which is before us <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee will have listened with respect to what the minister has just said but i do not know that the respect will necessarily be accompanied in this case by sympathy or understanding <e> <s> under the bill it is not an irresponsible person who will be dealing with the question of ending trial periods it will be the minister <e> <s> the minister cannot do it as i understand the position unless it is on the application of the local authority <e> <s> from what the noble lord has just said one would have gathered that it was the local authority which had been given the power to end the trial period designation order <e> <s> it is the minister <e> <s> obviously he will have before him all the considerations that the noble lord lord bellwin has pointed out the harm that would be done the reckless nature of making this application so far as the local authority is concerned before it should be <e> <s> but to write into an act of parliament a definite prohibition so far as the minister is concerned so that he cannot in spite of the local authority having applied end the trial period of experimentation in spite of all the chaos that was referred to by the noble lord opposite in his if i may say so very useful speech and to bar the question of ending the experiment in an act of parliament is i feel foolhardy <e>", "<cs> will the minister allow me to intervene only in order to help him <e> <s> i think the committee might be assisted if they were reminded that in another section of this bill the operator will be protected <e> <s> it may be that through an amendment he may be protected for a lesser or a longer period but if the minister were to say that this would be subject to all the proper protection for the operator who may be allowed to continue for a certain time in spite of the revocation of the trial period designation order i think the committee might know they were then dealing with a very just issue <e> <s> since the operator is going to be protected under this bill anyway what please is the validity of the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> much happier <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee have considered the situation that could arise in a matter of this kind <e> <s> a designation order for a trial area could be made for five years <e> <s> however the minister might decide as a result of representations and on the basis that the other clause is amended after a period of two years that the way in which the service has been operated is unsatisfactory <e> <s> the licence to the operator we are thinking of might have been given for five years <e> <s> despite the fact that one of the reasons for ending the experiment might be the way in which that operator had functioned it would mean that the operator who may have been the cause of chaos in the trial area would continue to operate for another three years without the need for any other licence <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underbill said it is only reasonable that some protection should be given <e> <s> your lordships may feel that to allow this to go on for such a period is unreasonable <e>", "<cs> on the basis of the previous understanding reached with the minister i will say no more but just wait for the report stage <e>", "<cs> will the minister forgive me for this intervention which with his usual courtesy he has allowed me to make <e> <s> the minister is repeating in far clearer language than i used the situation which is common ground <e> <s> of course it has to be taken to a testing station if it is in a bad condition <e> <s> obviously regulations may be made hereafter which will allow that to be done <e> <s> the point that i was on is that it is so absurd in an act of parliament to say without any definition clause at all on what irremovable means in this subsection that it is irremovable but it has to be taken to a testing station <e> <s> that is the only point i am trying to cover <e> <s> i do not want to waste the time of the committee <e> <s> if the minister will in his kindness take this back and see that we do not do something which is unnecessarily absurd i shall be grateful and the committee can go on with its other business <e>", "<cs> on that very courteous assurance i ask for the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee would like to congratulate the minister on the very attributes which he modestly gave himself in describing this amendment namely that it is now a much clearer amendment <e> <s> there is one point which he mentioned which is important and that is that the bills previous definition of convictions of five years obviously should have been improved and has been improved by this now becoming relevant convictions <e>", "<cs> i rise merely in order to probe into whether or not there is complete cover here <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord can help me <e> <s> if he cannot do so at the moment i shall understand it if he wants time to consider the point <e> <s> this deals with the question of some mishap occurring with a transport manager upon whom the business relies whether he ceases to be of good repute or dies or becomes mentally unstable <e> <s> what is the position if it is an occurrence which does not terminate the transport managers services but suspends his services <e> <s> take the obvious example of an employer who is very considerate but may not operate for the benefit of the public or the safety of the public and who waits for his transport manager who has taken a prolonged holiday for an unreasonably long period and the business is not properly covered and the transport manager is the one relied upon <e> <s> if one goes into the realms of crime which this deals with in some way what happens if it is not a question of finding a new transport manager but of waiting for a prosecution to be concluded where a transport manager is charged with something and the employer and again dealing with i almost said undertaking a company or business which is reliant upon the transport managers skill says i know he has been remanded in custody for all this time <e> <s> in the circumstances i feel i ought to wait until the prosecution is finished <e> <s> it is unfortunate that he keeps on being remanded in custody all this time <e> <s> as i said i am not quite sure that my own investigations were complete and it may be that this is covered in some schedule or clause that i have not traced <e> <s> it may be that it is something which ought to be covered <e>", "<cs> i rise again only to clarify the question that i put <e> <s> i am taking it for granted that it is something which would not reach the traffic commissioners knowledge <e> <s> the employer will have no duty as i understand it to notify if there was a question of illness or of such matters as i have indicated <e> <s> if the noble lord will have the whole of that matter looked into where it does not come necessarily to the notice of the traffic commissioners i should be grateful <e>", "<cs> may i at once make it clear there is no argument at all with the principle of this amendment so far as my friends and i are concerned <e> <s> one little doubt creeps into ones mind however at the use of this power by the traffic commissioners allied to the word temporarily without any definition <e> <s> the committee can well understand that applications for licences may be heard with opposition which is withdrawn upon a condition being agreed to be put into a licence <e> <s> the traffic commissioners because of something unforeseen will have an application made to them for the removal of that condition <e> <s> it is absolutely right as the minister says that if this were a matter of a day or two it would be quite absurd to ask that there should then be consultation with other applicants or consultation with other authorities before the condition is waived <e> <s> unfortunately however the bill now talks in terms of the word temporarily without any definition without any limitation on those words <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister has in mind some direction by way of regulation or whatever it may be with a rather neater definition of what temporarily means so that the traffic commissioners realise exactly where they stand and the limitation of their powers <e>", "<cs> i rise only briefly to save the committee some further time and to spare them another speech from me <e> <s> i have in fact moved amendment no <e> <s> and i did not mention that i was speaking then also in regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the reason for that was that if the objection was that any person was too wide and one ought to limit the definition i was going to plead on amendment no <e> <s> for better english by defining what any person meant and making it perfectly clear as a result to whom whose repute and competence are relied on really referred in this clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the minister moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am talking on amendment no <e> <s> and the words <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that guidance <e> <s> there is a procedural matter that i had overlooked <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for my ignorance <e> <s> before i go into the question of the wording and i promise not to repeat my speech because members of the committee will be aware of the point that i am making all i wish to say as regards these amendments namely amendments nos <e> <s> and which i shall speak to together with the committees leave is that questions of convictions are obviously of great materiality <e> <s> it may be a question of a conviction which implies that the public may be at danger because of what has happened in regard to a charge that may have been brought and very relevant too to matters of transport <e>", "<cs> i make only one comment in regard to what the minister has said <e> <s> i am quite well aware that this indeed would mean an alteration of the law on the time limit <e> <s> the whole purport of this bill is indeed to impose an onus in a very different way on the question of the granting of licences <e> <s> it appears to be the governments ambition to have many more licences granted than have been granted in the past <e> <s> therefore in the new circumstances i should have thought that this safeguard was a relevant one <e>", "<cs> as i promised i shall not repeat my speech but i hope that in courtesy it will be answered <e>", "<cs> that does not cover the point <e> <s> i am afraid that the minister forces me to my feet again only because with great respect his speech did not cover the point i made <e> <s> perhaps i may summarise it and i hope that the patience of the committee will be as generous as it always is while i do so <e> <s> i can well understand why it is necessary that a conviction to be reported should be one relevant to the transport industry and to the whole conduct of a transport business <e> <s> i do not seek to make any point that any other conviction should be notified but the wording as now included in this amendment restricts the matter to <e>", "<cs> we have a long day before us and i do not intend to take up the time of the committee on matters of this kind <e> <s> i would only observe that i always find the tones of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran so mellifluous when he agrees with what i say <e> <s> i found his voice very acceptable on this amendment <e> <s> i would only ask the minister to consider this point before report stage <e> <s> where there is serious risk as is implied in the clause to the safety of passengers and crew it does seem to be so foolish if i may use the term to have an offence prescribed in a bill for the contravention of the duty to inform the authorities of such a bad stage of repair or danger and to leave the question so arguable before the courts as to whether or not the report was made as soon as practicable <e> <s> it means that in every single case there will be an argument <e> <s> that was the reason i believe that inspired the agreement of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i merely ask the minister if he will have another think about it before report <e> <s> i do not want to detain the committee any longer on this <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the tones from the liberal benches most harmonious <e> <s> the only principle that i am advancing is that the citizen shall know on looking at a clause of the bill which affects him vitally what his time limits are <e> <s> they should not be put in regulations <e> <s> the question of how long the period of time should be is unimportant as compared with that principle <e> <s> regarding local government consultations have been des <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may say so without sounding pompous lawyers are used to that difficulty and rules are made which do delete non-working days holidays and so on <e> <s> but once again may i repeat to the committee that it is not a question of time that binds me in this amendment it is a question of principle <e>", "<cs> i confess to some disappointment that the noble minister read to the committee a definition description and clarification of a clause which i believe if i may say so with deep respect was clear to them before the explanation was even given <e> <s> it does not deal in any way with the point which i tried to make to the committee <e> <s> i said as the minister was fair enough to repeat that obviously the person concerned will one would imagine make his application as soon as possible <e> <s> what i said was that because there is no time limit here the traffic commissioners will not know what the position is because the application can be made at any time up to the time of the expiration of the appeal period <e> <s> again because i feel this is a rather technical point although i believe an important one i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will be good enough to look at what has been said between now and the report stage and possibly find that he can be rather more helpful on that occasion <e>", "<cs> on that very courteous basis i ask for the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i first welcome the very correct dictum of the noble lord the minister which i should have loved to hear before that in order that people may know what are their rights these should be incorporated in the bill and not referred to in a schedule <e> <s> it is absolutely correct as the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> i shall detain the committee only for one minute <e> <s> i should have been delighted to accept that point were it not for the wording in the second line of subsection <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the industry will be heartened by this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i can save the time of the committee by speaking now to amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name and those of my noble friends <e> <s> first i repeat the point about the inappro-priateness of dealing by regulations with matters which really ought to be in a bill <e> <s> may i express the hope that the consultations the minister may be having will enable him at the report stage not to deal with this matter by way of regulations but to make it part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish only to raise two points on this new clause <e> <s> i think it is a most sensible clause and i am sure that the members of the committee are glad to see it on the marshalled list <e> <s> one of my two points is major and the other i must confess is minor <e> <s> the major one arises under subsection <e> <s> the committee will be aware that this is a question of a power to terminate a licence <e> <s> without any doubt at all if we look at the matters in subsection subject to the point raised by the noble lord lord morris with regard to subsection c it is eminently fair and reasonable but hidden in subsection we find that the regulations <e>", "<cs> when dealing with amendment no <e> <s> a i made the observations that i wanted to make as regards amendment no <e> <s> so i shall not repeat them <e> <s> the minister has been kind enough to give an assurance that he will look at certain points and i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> the forecast of the minister that i would have some pleasure and some displeasure at his remarks was completely accurate <e> <s> my pleasure is that i have his sympathy <e> <s> my displeasure is that it is passive sympathy and that nothing has been proffered by the noble lord to deal with the situation which he himself acknowledges is unjust <e> <s> are we really to continue to be faced with a situation where other governments in the community decide to do various things to protect their trade and industry and our government sit idly by <e>", "<cs> it is with some hesitation that in regard to this amendment i take the course that the minister has invited me to take <e> <s> i know how helpful the minister tries to be and i know that he like so many of us wishes the bill to be as effective as possible whether or not we like the original policy in regard to it <e> <s> i am accepting his assurance in its literal sense that he will really have the matter looked at very carefully with those of his colleagues who may be able to assist in regard to questions of police prosecutions and so on <e> <s> on the clear understanding that he will be good enough to let me know and no doubt the noble lord lord teviot would also wish to be informed of progress regarding his thoughts and those of his right honourable friend on this matter and will do so well before report stage so that if necessary we shall know that we have to repeat the amendment in some form or other at that stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise only to ensure that a point that i previously made when the noble minister spoke on this matter has been looked at by him <e> <s> alternatively if he has not had the opportunity to do so which i can quite understand i should like to know whether he still has the point in mind <e> <s> i should like to take the committee through only the four matters dealt with in subsection a of the new clause namely clauses and <e> <s> with regard to all those matters it is a defence to prove that there was a reasonable excuse for the act or omission in respect of which the defendant is charged <e>", "<cs> may i inquire whether the noble lord lord morris is thinking of changing his profession and becoming a parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> because the number of occasions on which he has suggested drafting improvements which have been accepted by the government while possibly making the responsible parliamentary draftsman not so happy makes the committee happy that they have lord morris in their midst <e>", "<cs> may i intervene with your lordships permission to say that that is not the experience in this place as i hope the noble lord will find in a few minutes <e>", "<cs> the committee will have noticed that not one single reason has been given by the minister as to why the order should not be affirmed by both houses of parliament <e> <s> the minister has not pleaded that this would in any event mean a delay it would have been extraordinary if he had because as i have said the appointed day has not yet been fixed <e> <s> nobody knows when it is going to be <e> <s> there will not be any hurry thereafter <e> <s> it is a question of a sell-off and it is purely a question of becoming as we have heard an ordinary limited company <e>", "<cs> i rise only to clarify the point and will do it very quickly <e> <s> i was not expressing fears on behalf of shareholders <e> <s> i was expressing fears on behalf of the nation as to who the shareholders might be <e>", "<cs> will i be forgiven if i rise and i promise that it will be for the last time in order to make one point abundantly clear <e> <s> it is a completely truthful answer which the minister has given as one would expect of him but the truth has been expressed in a summarised form <e> <s> it is absolutely correct that all it will say is this is going to be the appointed day but whether parliament agrees that that should be the appointed day and that vesting should take place <e>", "<cs> nor will the noble lord the minister be surprised if in one sentence i answer his last observation it is a very different thing to write off part of a debt for the benefit of the nation represented by the national freight corporation <e> <s> however if one writes off a further million for the benefit of the subsequent purchaser in the private sector one is dealing with a very different matter and the noble lord knows it <e>", "<cs> i know that when the noble viscount addresses questions to me he always does so in order to be helpful and i take that question in precisely that spirit <e> <s> of course it is correct and i cannot deny it that any purchaser will very much prefer to buy his way into a company which owes million less than otherwise would be the case <e> <s> the point that i am making is that the nation will lose by it in the sense that the price that <e>", "<cs> i will answer that question from the noble viscount very briefly <e> <s> there would not be any question of waiting <e> <s> as i understand it it is not a deferred loan it is a loan which could become immediately payable <e> <s> therefore the purchaser would have to provide for the repayment of the loan since the national freight corporation would be passing on this liability to the company and therefore presumably the company would have to pay <e> <s> the securities would be sold and the loan would have to be repaid <e>", "<cs> the committee will have observed that this is a new amendment which found its way on to the second marshalled list <e> <s> unfortunately the minister has not been able to accord the usual courtesy of supplying notes on clauses and he must therefore forgive me if the questions that i pose to him turn out to be misconceived <e> <s> we have done our best in the interval it has been a very short one with such expert guidance as we have to understand the amendment which in general terms seems acceptable but upon which certain questions do arise <e>", "<cs> i think what hurts so badly to those who sit on this side of the committee and i have an idea that this concern will be shared by many in whatever parts of the committee they may sit including the noble viscount lord simon who has already put a question on this is that it just shows and i am not trying to make any dramatic point the complete callousness with which the transfer of a great corporation such as this to private enterprise is made that when we come to the committee stage and the bill has already been through another place the government are unable to say this amendment having been put down for some time how many employees there are who are engaged on research whether indeed they are engaged on research exclusively or not <e> <s> the noble viscounts question was most pertinent <e> <s> possibly he was as surprised as i was when there was a reply such as that given by the noble lord lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> will the noble minister please carry on with that undertaking before we adjourn and say that he will also see that such a department is not shut down and that people in research are not dismissed on any sale of the securities from the company to the market <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry i am corrected by my noble friend <e> <s> i said exhausted position <e> <s> i was thinking of the noble lord lord bellwin when i used that word <e> <s> i meant exalted position when i referred to the right honourable gentleman mr norman fowler <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is not prepared to have a discussion on company law which would bore it even though the subject may be of interest to the noble lord lord morris and myself <e> <s> quite obviously there is nothing to prevent the inclusion of a provision that the memorandum and articles of association cannot be altered unless a certain number of votes is cast say per cent <e> <s> therefore it is possible to include in the original memorandum and articles of association what are the rights of profits for the various holders of shares and that is unalterable unless some other shareholders go in with those who have per cent <e> <s> of the voting control <e> <s> i do not wish to continue this argument with the noble lord lord morris but he may take it from me i hope that he will that it is quite possible to secure the rights of shareholders to dividends and profits as set out in an original memorandum and articles of association and still have per cent <e> <s> of the voting control <e>", "<cs> it was <e>", "<cs> i make only a brief comment and it is this <e> <s> i hope that nobody will be voting upon this matter if a vote is in fact necessitated on the basis of whether or not there is profit or whether or not there is redundancy <e> <s> i think it is a general question of the need to have control of this corporation in the national interest by at least the percentage that i mentioned <e> <s> i therefore hope that the committee will feel that that is a principle that they ought to endorse <e> <s> it is not one i beg to assure the noble viscount which embeds within it the principle of nationalisation <e> <s> that is not so at all it is the very principle that i remember the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran mentioning on second reading was one with which he had the utmost sympathy <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in the bill which secures the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord that this amendment has nothing to do with endeavouring to stop the sale of subsidiaries in the years ahead <e> <s> the amendment is quite specific <e> <s> it says that the securities to be offered for sale <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will be patient with me <e> <s> if he concurs with every word of the amendment and merely has the point that it is unnecessary i hope that in those circumstances he will not dream of opposing it <e> <s> if intentions expressed in either house of parliament were all that was necessary in order to govern the future events of this nation there would be no point in having bills or acts of parliament <e>", "<cs> the minister is saying this is how i have understood him that if the amendment on further consideration means what i have said it means tonight then it will be an amendment that will be accepted by the government if it is capable of another interpretation he may have to have second thoughts <e> <s> if that is the understanding between us then i am perfectly prepared not to press the amendment tonight and to see exactly <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy with the ministers assurance and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the correction <e> <s> i am in some difficulty because the minister in fact answered him and to quote the answer of the minister without being able to quote the contribution to which he made the answer is rather difficult <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the help i am getting from all sides which is really most courteous <e> <s> may i take it in this way <e> <s> the honourable member for faversham made a reference to the happy position in which a future purchaser would be by being able to take advantage of these tax losses and the minister the parliamentary secretary mr kenneth clarke replied as follows i am quoting from column <e>", "<cs> if i may say so with great respect the noble lord merely repeated what i had i hope properly told the committee was the position as explained by the minister that is that tax losses would be available to be set against future profits only within the subsidiary that had made the losses <e> <s> but my point is that if that subsidiary is taken over by private enterprise as is <e>", "<cs> all i can say in regard to that is if the minister feels that it would be a wrong principle for asset stripping to take place would he not agree that at least an undertaking by the government at this stage that that would be discouraged would meet part of the point of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be very sensible if i were able to study <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that the minister is right <e> <s> he may be right but in view of the hour i think that both of us had better see what the situation is after we read the report of the proceedings <e> <s> we can deal with the matter if necessary later on <e>", "<cs> it should be section <e>", "<cs> i thought that the minister with his usual kindness was trying to help me because it should read defined in sections and of this act and not section as the bill now stands <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was referring to that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the trouble he has taken in regard to the detailed reply which he has given to the observations that i made <e> <s> they are worthy of such respect that i would want to ponder upon them when they appear in the <e>", "<cs> the minister is to be congratulated on the ease with which he managed to meander through the maze of amendments which he discussed together <e> <s> if i am not quite so successful in treading my path through them i hope he will forgive me but there are some observations i wish to make on some of the amendments with which he dealt <e> <s> first in regard to amendment no <e> <s> b and i do not expect the minister to reply now but it would be a courtesy if he would communicate with me on the points i am now raising the wording does not seem very clear <e> <s> suppose that in a surplus is revealed in one of the basic <e>", "<cs> i will study all that the noble lord has said <e> <s> i find his reply somewhat disappointing <e> <s> perhaps i shall see a glimmer of light when i read the <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his expression of sympathy but it does not appear to have very much practical application <e> <s> i equally note his expression of regret and i hope that it at least covers the pomise to look further into this matter <e> <s> it may very well be that some <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee would be greatly educated by the minister elaborating on what was said but as i merely sought a repetition of the assurance i think i can spare the committees time <e> <s> in view of theassurance which has been repeated i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will possibly realise that we are coming to some important amendments in a moment <e> <s> i am referring to that of the noble lord lord selsdon and to amendment no <e> <s> and i have an idea that it may lead to clarity of thought if i withdraw this amendment at this stage instead of having it formally confirmed or negatived and leave the decision as to what is done in regard to this amendment until after we have seen the result of either amendment no <e> <s> a or amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on that basis i ask leave to withdraw the amendment but the principle which i have tried to enunciate is certainly not withdrawn <e>", "<cs> again i am going to study what the noble lord the minister has said in order to see whether this matter could or should be brought forward at the report stage <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i almost rush to the dispatch box in order to deal at this hour very shortly and simply with a matter that i believe the noble minister and i thought would take a very long time <e> <s> i say that because of the arguments that could be advanced both ways in <e> <s> regard to what was said on second reading and what is said now <e> <s> there is not a scrap of politics in the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord selsdon or in the amendment which stands in my name and that of my noble friends <e> <s> our one desire and we think that it is a united desire of this committee is to see that justice is done that there is honourable dealing that promises are promises and that governments are honourable whatever may be their political complexion <e>", "<cs> i think it may be for the noble lord lord selsdon to speak more than i but i feel that the minister has expressed sympathy with the idea i think that should be recorded and a wish to try to be accommodating <e> <s> in those circumstances and if that be the spirit i certainly would be prepared if the noble lord lord selsdon is to withdraw my amendment when it comes <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord selsdon may have the same view about his amendment <e>", "<cs> whether what i have said appears in the <e>", "<cs> i shall do just that <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it would be extremely helpful if that did take place because there are many arguments on which i am briefed to what the noble minister has already said and it would be most inconsiderate if i inflicted those arguments on the committee now <e> <s> it would be much more practical i think if we had an exchange <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister conducts his review will he be good enough to remember the tradition created south of the border by queen boadicea <e>", "<cs> my lords to revert to the original question if i may is the minister aware that one of the industries which is suffering in regard to the export trade is the gramophone record industry and would he take this into account in not furnishing the playing of gramophone records for internal consumption so frequently as he does and assist instead in the export of gramophone records <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow if i may on what the noble lord the <e>", "<cs> it should not be my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord morris was kind enough to recall to your lordships memory the discussion that took place on this matter earlier may i very briefly indicate the concern i expressed then and still feel <e> <s> i remember that the noble lord lord morris challenged me on that occasion to distinguish between occasion and event and i remember that we smiled across the benches as i remarked that i personally could not tell whether if it ever occurred that the government gave way to any opposition amendment that would be either a special occasion or a special event <e> <s> the noble lord lord morris says both <e> <s> i only tell him that if this occurs this afternoon we shall be celebrating both in no uncertain fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the ministers logic is followed in your lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house before he sits down will the minister at least clarify my mind on this in what circumstances does he think that a local authority in this country plus a minister would make such a mistake as to revoke an order in view of the circumstances that he himself has outlined to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house considers with its usual care anything that the noble lord the minister has to say may i try to deal with the very real point that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth raised <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord the minister would say in reply that obviously the minister on the recommendation of the local authority can at any time as i understand it make an order under this clause <e> <s> having a maximum of five years for the original experiment would surely not stop the local authority in the event of a successful experiment applying for a further order to be made by way of further trial in respect of a trial area and the minister then would be able to make the order for a period up to five years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord morris has raised a very important point following on the speech of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and i think that the noble baroness had this point in her mind too <e> <s> obviously if there is sense in having co-operation and one can well see where that sense is vital then there ought to be co-operation and it ought to be encouraged but it should not be written into an act of parliament <e> <s> one cannot force people to co-operate <e> <s> if one makes this a statutory duty one causes co-operation in a voluntary spirit to fly out of the window <e> <s> people do not like being ordered to cooperate and to exchange information <e> <s> they prefer a sensible approach being made to them and that is really in the interests of everyone <e> <s> that as i understood it was the whole burden of the speech of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> really it is vital of course in the spirit of this amendment and that is why in any decision which may be made on this i hope it will not be a decision based on the fact that anybody is suggesting that there should not be co-operation <e> <s> it is on the point that it should not be written into the bill <e>", "<cs> i cannot pretend that this argument ought to be carried any further <e> <s> it is a question of putting ones point of view and hearing a very courteous reply <e> <s> one merely says i hope with the same courtesy that one does not agree with the reply but one thereupon sits down and mutters content and hears the discontented opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely true that the noble lord was kind enough to write to me and he said in his letter precisely what he has just said to your lordships <e> <s> my only comments are as follows it can hardly be said to be a difference between what may be a minor defect to a vehicle and a major one when one reads into this section that the requirement to notify and i did emphasise those words is only in the case where the damage or failure is <e>", "<cs> my lords here again the noble lord the minister was kind enough to write to me and did so in terms as kindly as those he has used in the house this afternoon <e> <s> i am only too glad that some observations of mine have at least been of use in the course of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reminded of a speech made some years ago by the noble viscount the first lord samuel a figure who was loved in this house a much respected member on the liberal benches <e> <s> he was addressing the civil service on their centenary celebrations and after paying a wonderful tribute to them for the way they had helped his career he said however there is one thing i have always found in regard to them they have a problem for every solution <e> <s> i was reminded of that when i heard the replies given to what was the very humane purpose of this <e>", "<cs> so my lords somebody who has not got to seek the leave of the house will now to the displeasure of the house thereupon address them <e> <s> my lords i do not intend to take long <e> <s> there is i think a point which has not yet been brought out clearly in this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord teviot dealt with a code of manners exhibited by this generation which it appears is different from the manners of the last generation <e> <s> that may or may not be true <e> <s> one thing that this generation appears to have inherited certainly in these contemporary times is a degree of violence on transport which i think has brought shame to the members of the public who are responsible for it <e> <s> i therefore think that we have got to give a little more concentration to this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the brevity i promised the minister having been brief and to the point i will merely quote what the minister said in another place <e> <s> when asked on th november the reference is col <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will have listened with great interest to the contribution of the noble lord lord morris and one noticed how the government chief whip was intensely interested in the contribution that he had to make <e> <s> i now know that the sympathy of the government chief whip is obviously with me in this amendment i could tell that from the look on his face <e>", "<cs> my lords i must immediately say how accurate i was in thinking that the government chief whip was in favour of my amendment <e> <s> i do appreciate his very helpful observation that i mean in all seriousness because it was most kind of him to put me right about this <e> <s> in those circumstances with the very kind hint and in the belief that my faith in the government is so well justified that i shall have some reward before third reading on behalf of these pensioners i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> i am full of apologies tonight and i am sorry if i have put two feet wrong successively <e> <s> i spoke i thought with the leave of the house to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i thought therefore that having disposed of my speech and having withdrawn i was now being allowed to speak to no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had not heard no <e> <s> called <e> <s> i thought it was no <e> <s> so i apologise and sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not burden the house with a detailed answer to the ministers speech <e> <s> i am afraid he has completely forgotten the proviso which i emphasised and which i emphasise again because that proviso in my respectful submission meets the main burden of his argument namely that the amendment now put forward contains this proviso which ensures that the obligation will not in any case exceed the total payments i am repeating what i said before including pensions increases which would have been payable if the schemes rules had remained unchanged since st january <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be convenient if i inflict upon your lordships one speech certainly one of any length on this matter and in doing that on this amendment i reserve my right to make a few remarks on my amendment which follows <e> <s> this is an opportunity for this house to show itself at its best <e> <s> it does so i say this respectfully as a comparatively new member if it is dealing with a matter where justice equity and judgment are required and where no political considerations enter into it <e> <s> if my noble friends are not convinced by the arguments contained in the amendment or by any observations i make i do not ask for their support <e> <s> and in facing noble lords opposite i say precisely the same to them hoping that similarly if they are favourably inclined towards the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords to save the time of the house i propose to address my very few remarks not only to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b but to a a and a <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble minister has said and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i remain in pleasant intellectual ignorance of <e>", "<cs> my lords it takes me to the beginning of the road and unfortunately not to the end of it <e> <s> but these are technical matters as the noble lord so rightly said <e> <s> again i think that the best course for me to adopt since i feel that the minister has not dealt with the points that i tried to make which were fresh points as against those advanced at the committee stage is to beg leave to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the minister and i can exchange views in the meantime again hoping that some kind of accommodation can be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the development of the argument could much more usefully take place in the intervening period and not at the risk of wearing your lordships patience at on a friday afternoon <e> <s> this is of such importance to the pensioners and the fund that it would be just to them to adopt that procedure <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendmnt <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that local authorities are being forced by her majestys government to take this position either to fail to provide vital local services or to increase the rates <e> <s> as this house knows that the noble lord is humane as well as a human being which choice would he make if he were once again a local councillor <e>", "<cs> my lords i was more than happy to defer to the noble baroness who is such an expert <e> <s> can the noble lord inform the house whether one really has to take it for granted that the united nations is powerless in this matter <e> <s> is it not somewhat inconsistent that when a small nation perpetrates something which is thought by the united nations to be contrary to the charter there can so easily be condemnatory resolutions whereas in the case of a big power with a veto the united nations seems powerless <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister gave a very learned classical quotation and in answer i have been trying to think of the equivalent latin for the phrase if you have a strong case you should be able to demolish in two sentences a long speech <e> <s> i have not found the latin for that but if i find it later i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i quote it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister because again he returns to a theme which if i may say so does not help his case <e> <s> i have not talked in terms of other pension funds being in surplus or in deficit <e> <s> i have said that there is no other pension fund of a nationalised industry whose monies were used for the purpose of the industry itself instead of being properly invested <e> <s> as i understand it the post office unfortunately ran into deficit for totally different reasons <e> <s> that is why the commitment was made by the government that is why your lordships have a special burden upon your consciences tonight i say that without any hesitation at all that is why the review in this case creates no precedent and is no different from the view that the noble lord lord nugent felt ought to be taken in regard to all other nationalised pension funds <e> <s> and that is why i ask your lordships to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is somewhat of a pity when a minister has to express sympathy with pensioners of this kind and not be able to come forward with support of an amendment which would have cost so little in this bill <e> <s> there is no need for me to reply to the noble ministers comments because i had thought that these would be the comments and i tried to deal with them both in the speech i made today and the speeches i made on previous occasions <e> <s> i feel i owe it to the pensioners and that this house does also to divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> since the noble minister has been quoting maxims to me i should like to quote to him a maxim that is sacrosanct in this house no one shall be a judge in his own cause <e> <s> the minister is obviously a party to this matter <e> <s> should there be a difference between the minister and those responsible for the pension funds it will be just and will be seen to be just if there is an arbitrator <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be most ungracious of me not to say thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise i shall be very brief but i should like to take the opportunity as someone to whom your lordships have shown much patience in the course of the debates on this bill to pay my tribute to the noble lord lord bellwin for the manner in which he has piloted his first bill through this chamber <e> <s> it is odd that it should be a transport bill but may i say that if his piloting is equalled by the drivers of whom we have been talking in their manner of conducting their vehicles i am perfectly sure that the nation will be satisfied with its drivers at all events <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i am in order before the noble earl sits down in asking him if in his kindness he could clarify one point for me on the bill as it now reaches us from the select committee <e> <s> if this point arises out of ignorance i ask for forgiveness because for most of us this is the first time we have had an opportunity of hearing an explanation of the bill as it now stands <e>", "<cs> my lords while the house is engaged on this completely non-political series of questions and answers may i ask the noble earl if he has the figures available by way of estimate what he estimates is the cost to the country of the non-intervention of the government in the steel strike which has led to such devastating results not only in the steel industry but in the general economy of the country <e>", "<cs> before the minister continues i wonder whether he would elucidate for the benefit of us all how he estimates as i make it per rent officer charge for dwellings <e> <s> to me this is completely and absolutely absurd but it may be that i have misunderstood the minister <e>", "<cs> as always the noble lord is most courteous but the committee is trying to make up its mind on an argument <e> <s> the argument on one side is that it would cost million <e> <s> that may or may not be right <e> <s> the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not from the front bench but from the back bench of the opposition in order to deal with the remarks made by my noble friend lady burton for whom i have <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been privileged this afternoon to listen to some outstanding speeches <e> <s> i know that none of the other speakers will be in the slightest degree offended if i say there were outstanding statesmanlike speeches from my noble friend lord stewart and from the noble lord the foreign secretary <e> <s> i rise to address some remarks in regard to one aspect of the debate that we are having this afternoon and that is in the area of the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so grateful to the noble earl for intervening because he shows if i may say so an extremism that i am trying awfully hard to avoid be it on the arab or the israeli side <e> <s> nothing i have said could have suggested in the slightest degree anything other than the fact that obviously there must be autonomy and self-government for an arab minority which has so high a population in its own area and wants to pursue a culture of its own in precisely the same way as the africans do in south africa but unfortunately they are prevented from doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord talks in terms of separate development i invite him to live in south africa and not in this free country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister informing the house of the result of a survey and an analysis of this problem or has he merely been guided in general terms <e> <s> if the latter does he not think it worth while that there should be a more detailed examination before the house drops the idea which seems to be extremely sound to most of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to add a few words to those which have already been said since your lordships would be rather impatient if i merely repeated in somewhat less eloquent language what has already been said <e> <s> on behalf of the profession of which i am a humble but proud member may i say that these regulations are certainly very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of this house whose wisdom is always limited to matters after the event may i ask whether it is a fact that the decorative state of the ceiling had not been inspected for many years <e> <s> indeed i have heard one version which says that it has not been inspected since <e> <s> have we at least learned the lesson and i see the gesticulations of the noble lord the leader of the house and i may say that i am referring to our own chamber which appears to be a very expensive one in this instance that regular inspections hereafter should be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add to the congratulations and good wishes expressed to the noble lord lord grinston of westbury on his very welcome maiden speech <e> <s> in the absence from his place i hope only temporary of the minister may i apologise for the fact that i did not have the privilege of hearing the major part of his speech <e> <s> i only came in for the concluding words of lord bellwins introduction of the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i think that must have been psychological because i found as i wended my way to your lordships house that it was as though my feet were bound down with lead and that is because of my love of my fellow man <e> <s> i could not bear to hear the noble lord whose participation in local government in this country has been so notable suffer what must have been the internal agony of introducing the second reading of a bill which in many parts reduces local authorities to the status of eunuchs at the court of the emperor heseltine <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble minister has been kind enough to mention my name in connection with this quotation <e> <s> i think that the house would wish him in every incarnation to look as well and as vocal as he has been tonight <e> <s> but would he kindly in referring to a previous incarnation of his say how as a local authority man he would look upon a provision which he has not mentioned so far namely that a secretary of state should be able without any inquiry and without any independent arbitrator to decide what properties a local authority will have to sell which belong to that local authority and the terms upon which the sale must take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is always gracious in giving way and i am not going to impose upon the house any more interventions of mine i promise <e> <s> would he please remember that this is a local government bill and we are concerned tonight with the rights and duties and powers of local authorities and how they are being infringed <e> <s> we are not dealing tonight with nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that political irony is not acceptable to this house as a substitute for proper informed replies to questions <e> <s> is he further aware and if not would he consult the equal opportunities commission that controls are not exercised formidably by corsets in these days and if he is in any doubt about the effectiveness of corsets as a method of control would he kindly consult his right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to clarify one point to the satisfaction of the house <e> <s> the statement has been made that there have been no negotiations with one local authority body as distinct from any other <e> <s> can he confirm that in the discussions that have taken place no invitations have been accorded in regard to those discussions to one association which have not been accorded to the other local authority associations <e> <s> can he also confirm that there have been no discussions in relation to the committee stage of this bill with one local authority association which have also not taken place with other local authority associations <e> <s> if he could clarify that in simple language it would make many of us much happier <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i am persistent but the minister <e>", "<cs> the minister generously said that if he found on all sides of the committee a request that this should be altered to an affirmative resolution he would lend his usually willing and courteous ear to that plea and in that context i have two points to make the first one of principle <e> <s> where one takes away from a democratically elected body <e>", "<cs> i should not have risen but for two points raised in committee this evening on the subject of direct labour <e> <s> i had always understood that one of the characteristics of the welsh a wonderful characteristic is that they knew their bible <e> <s> but i listened to the noble lord lord evans referring to the fact that direct labour had nothing to do with his ark of the covenant <e> <s> it so happens that in the book of <e>", "<cs> it is really a question of how one sees the duty of local authorities <e> <s> some of us regard the duty of local authorities to give the most efficient treatment to their citizens and their ratepayers in regard to the services which are essential to them <e> <s> one of those essential services is quite obviously that of building houses maintaining houses and doing other work of an essential nature <e> <s> some of us have found and without anydoctrinaire views that to have a continuous direct labour organisation efficiently man <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what the minister is saying and i say this with great deference because he appears to be being very helpful and that is the last thing in the world i want to stop him from being by an intervention <e> <s> as i understood it my noble friend lord bruce was moving an amendment and i think he would be the first to agree that the little <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might follow possibly in the hope of shortening this debate in the same spirit as the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> yesterday we had some excursion if again i may borrow that phrase from the noble lord in regard to the relative <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister with his usual courtesy will give way <e> <s> he has just said very correctly that a power can be challenged in the courts <e> <s> i am sure that he would be the last person together with all members of this committee who would wish to leave a clause relating purely and simply to local government and national government based on fighting in the courts <e> <s> in the remainder of his very interesting and useful speech will the noble lord kindly indicate if he can whether there is any limitation that he <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down i think the committee will be grateful to him i personally am i have no right to speak for the committee for what i thought was the conciliatory attitude in regard to the subsections that worried my noble friends and myself namely and more than anything else in this clause <e> <s> nobody is endeavouring to claim a victory because i think many of us have said the same thing but if in answer to the speeches made on all sides of the committee he is saying that in regard to the secretary of states powers to close down a direct labour organisation he is thinking again of the wording in the section which gives that power in order to see whether there should be some limitation put upon it then i believe the committee knows what he has said and will be grateful for it <e> <s> but i should like him to be so kind as to say whether that is what he was saying because that is what i invited him some little time ago to do <e>", "<cs> the minister by his generous remarks has saved himself and the committee a further speech from me <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may say just a few words in support of my noble friend lord underhill and elucidate something which happened yesterday <e> <s> i regret that the elucidation takes place in the absence i believe of the noble lord lord renton who pointed out yesterday the difference between an affirmative and a negative resolution of the house <e> <s> it was then said that it is a much more simple matter for the house to deal with any variation of a regulation or making of a regulation and so on by a prayer for annulment <e> <s> and indeed it is by the affirmative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> the committee will have listened with rapt attention to what the noble lord lord evans said <e> <s> if i may say so he represents with great efficiency and great experience a minority party <e> <s> many of us who have served in local government some of us have been fortunate enough to serve all our lives as members of a majority party have always when we have considered the question of contribution to local government affairs welcomed the fact that there were many members of an opposition who had such a useful contribution to make especially on committees <e>", "<cs> i promise the committee to be brief and i hope not to repeat any point that has been made <e> <s> may i just extend one point namely that i could well understand a clause such as this being in a local government bill if the government had thought their way through the alternative to rating and had wanted to present it to the committee in order that the committee might know that it was a waste of time and money to have a quinquennial <e> <s> the views of noble friends on my side of the committee would obviously be very critical of any such alternative <e> <s> nevertheless it would be intelligible that one had this clause in the bill if the government had made up their mind to tell the committee that within so many years or months a new system would be put before parliament and therefore it was a waste of time and money as i have said to have a quinquennial valuation now <e> <s> so i join with those who ask the government to be frank with the committee and to say whether or not any such alternative plans have reached an advanced stage <e> <s> if it were possible it would be very nice to know their nature but if that is not possible at least we are entitled to know if this clause is to stand when it will be that the house will have an opportunity to consider such an alternative <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate sits down would he be good enough to deal with the questions i ventured to pose to him <e> <s> he has said that it is not now possible to say when an alternative scheme will be put before the house as an alternative to the rating system <e> <s> this i understand and i almost anticipated if i may say so with respect that that would be his reply <e> <s> if this clause is seriously put before the committee for endorsement can he tell the committee when is the latest date he would expect before the secretary of state decided that he would have to make an order in regard to valuation <e> <s> thirdly and lastly i did ask him and i said it was with a break in my voice and the lamentation becomes even more considerable when i get no reply why is it that we have been told repeatedly today and yesterday that whenever there is a pure administrative order to make i am looking at this moment at the noble minister who has made that declaration to the committee on so many occasions the appropriate procedure is to do it by the negative resolution procedure and the prayer to negate as it were whereas now when we come to a clause where it looks as though the secretary of state is not very keen on making an order of an administrative nature he suddenly asks for an affirmative resolution of the house <e> <s> i do ask if i may for a frank answer to both those questions <e>", "<cs> may i ask the lord advocate when dealing with the matter raised by his noble friend to say that this might be considered so that some of us who do not wish to table needless amendments on report may have our time saved here and now and know that the government are being generous in this respect <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might have your lordships indulgence as we have reached clause to make a point purely and simply for the convenience of members of the house and certainly members of the committee <e>", "<cs> i apologise for having intervened earlier but i just did not know how to get over the difficulty regarding our procedural rules <e> <s> the point that i was trying to make which i now make in order relates to the way in which clause had been printed in the bill now before the committee <e> <s> that was a plea only for clarity and especially for clarity for those who outside this chamber are not quite so accustomed to bills and to reading them and who because of their interests possibly which are peculiar and do not arise generally in regard to legislation have to read this bill and come to some sort of conclusion as to whether or not they should make representations upon the bill to any appropriate association <e>", "<cs> i also very much appreciated the comments of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on what was a minor point but it could occur again <e> <s> i hope the committee will forgive me for having raised it in the course of a very busy evening <e> <s> may i thank the noble viscount lord colville of culross for the lesson he has given me <e> <s> i assure him that i have learnt much from it <e> <s> his own contribution had it taken place before mine would have been much more worthy of the committee and of much more use to the committee <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the amendment and am somewhat surprised that the noble lord should word this amendment in a way which he says makes local authorities more answerable to the electorate <e> <s> has this bill not gone far enough not only in clipping the wings of local authorities but in absolutely slaughtering them in regard to their dignity and their powers <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not right that not a considerable amount of comfort can be drawn from a figure even of males and a constant figure of just over females who are remanded in custody for this purpose <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is certainly inviting a long speech at the very commencement of this matter <e> <s> if i find that in any remarks of mine i have not covered matters which do arise on the following amendments he mentioned i know that the committee with its usual courtesy will allow me to come back <e> <s> i do not want to burden the committee with too long an address <e> <s> it may be convenient now that we have reached this vital stage in the bill if i start by using a summary and i cannot do better than quote from notes on clauses in regard to the epoch-making nature of the provisions now before the committee <e> <s> notes on clauses by way of an introductory note say as follows <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would kindly give way for one moment <e> <s> is he really telling the committee that all the local authority associations of this country do not know their business <e>", "<cs> if i sound it correctly i think that possibly the committee has reached the stage when it may want to say whether or not it thinks that the government should think again before it flies in the face of all the local authority associations of this country and local government throughout the country <e> <s> i repeat that there should be an opportunity to think again and talk again which is the only thing i ask of the committee and of those who have spoken from all sides of the committee in favour of what i tried to put before <e> <s> in those circumstances if it meets with the convenience of the committee i propose to withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> and not move my amendment no <e> <s> to give the committee an opportunity to divide immediately on the main matter which is of course to leave out the clause <e>", "<cs> having heard the minister expatiate on this problem i do not intend to carry it any further at this stage <e> <s> i ask the committee for leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly understand the clear words of the minister <e> <s> i said before that the relationship of big brother and little brother in the case of national government and local government has now been altered to that of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the minister said and in the circumstances beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is quite correct that the confidence which the minister thought might not be transmitted from his bench to mine in fact has not been so transmitted because in his remarks he did not mention any sort of figure <e> <s> i was wondering if he thought was too much in regard to the vehicle and plant allowance with which we are dealing now whether he had in mind any other figure than the i mentioned <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise again but do so only to pursue the point for one moment <e> <s> i mentioned that the figure of was an indication that had been given in i think a document i do not think that it is actually in the bill <e> <s> therefore i was hoping that instead of it just being left <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am so grateful <e> <s> i should have noticed it myself since it is listed so close to the amendment with which we are now dealing <e> <s> thus i can be very brief in the hope that the voices of other noble lords instead of my voice will be heard on this matter <e>", "<cs> by way of a personal explanation may i tell the noble viscount that he is absolutely right that as a rule the shorter the amendment the better <e> <s> the only reason for the long-windedness of mine in setting out in heads <e>", "<cs> it is amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i think the minister is trying to be helpful and i am sure he will have a special look at for example category <e>", "<cs> i thought that the point raised by the noble lord lord sandford was an essential one for the understanding of this committee <e> <s> in case with his modesty he thinks he is the only person who did not understand what the position was may i tell him that many of his colleagues on the committee share his position <e> <s> i hope therefore that because this affects our thinking in a quite fundamental way the noble lord the minister will not accept the invitation to deal with this matter in writing but will give a full explanation to the committee now if he feels able to do so <e>", "<cs> i feel a very vital principle is involved here and i wanted to try so hard and did try so hard to extract some comfort of a practical nature from <e>", "<cs> i know how reason-able the noble lord lord renton is and i should love to follow him but i have a horrible idea that i should be <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that it does but i am deeply grateful for the very light way in which the reprimand was administered <e> <s> i feel that in both cases as regards both the carry forward and the main structure per cent <e> <s> is too low <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that the local authority associations take that view as well and that the flexibility ought to be extended to per cent <e> <s> that was the burden of the amendment <e> <s> however for not having made myself abundantly clear i apologise to the committee and accept the correction which was well administered <e>", "<cs> in the light of what has been said and the fact that i do not think i can carry it further at this stage i should like to look carefully at what the minister has said <e> <s> but at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my voice has been saved but what is now going to happen to my heart i cannot tell the committee <e> <s> possibly in view of the shock that has been administered to it i should sit clown at once and thank the minister for this the first of his gracious replies <e>", "<cs> i wonder where we are <e> <s> this is something about which the various local authority associations feel very fervently and the amc as the noble lord lord sandford said has put down a very reasoned amendment <e> <s> i am not quite sure where the minister has taken us <e> <s> his general expression of benevolence is always welcome but one asks for some practical result from that benevolence and i am not sure we have got one <e> <s> if the minister is saying that having heard the discussion he is prepared to have further discussions with a view to seeing whether the spirit of the amendment can be carried through namely that apart from the p rate part of the amendment the funds that come from elsewhere will not be counted as it were against the local authority then i am perfectly prepared because i think it would be the wish of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but if he is saying that i am sure he will not regard this as offensive simply as a way of getting rid of the discussion this afternoon and it will never be resumed from a practical point of view then i would not be doing my duty if i did not ask the committee to divide <e> <s> can the minister be a little clearer in what he is saying so that my noble friends and i can make up our minds <e>", "<cs> i understand that and i know the minister with faltering steps is trying to come some way near me <e> <s> perhaps i can offer him a helping hand <e> <s> is he able to say forgetting for the moment paragraph <e>", "<cs> since lotteries appear to be the only thing that appeal to the minister i think that we had better have the lottery of a division right away <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister remember the copy to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise only to test the view of the committee on the logic of this debate in the form that it is taking <e> <s> as i undertsand the amendment moved with his usual clarity and brevity by the noble viscount lord ridley it is that he does not like the idea of charging planning fees but if one is going to charge planning fees he would like the system to be extended <e>", "<cs> since the whole idea of my intervention was economy of time the last thing i want to do is to argue the point before the committee now at any length <e> <s> it seems to me to be the view certainly of some members that it would be more convenient to take the debate i am talking about on the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> therefore i reluctantly though i hope courteously sit down <e>", "<cs> i am in a little doubt as to the will of the committee <e> <s> i rather gathered that the noble lord the minister was saying that he would not regard as unwelcome a general debate which took in the various amendments and which also went to the principle of the whole question of planning fees <e>", "<cs> it is very obvious that i have not correctly interpreted the views of at least some members of the committee <e> <s> as i have said all i want to do is not to make an unwelcome speech at an unwelcome stage when my <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e>", "<cs> i think that i have found a way of briefly addressing the committee and possibly meeting the wishes

to beg that there shall be no extension indeed one even wonders whether there ought to be any question of planning fees at all <e> <s> that strikes me as being a relevant speech to make on an amendment which seeks extension <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way to save the time of the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone and i had an amendment down to try to do away with the right of charging on appeal <e> <s> when he was speaking just now i thought i understood the minister to say that that amendment had been conceded <e> <s> if that is so i thought i might save the time of the noble lord lord wigoder and the committee <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to detain the committee with any word at all in regard to the acceptance of this amendment which i am glad to see <e>

division lobbies of this committee <e>", "<cs> this ought not to be an appeal to a conservative administration or any political administration it ought to be an appeal if my noble friend lord morris will allow me to say so to <e>", "<cs> it is my sad duty at a quarter past one in the morning to a patient persevering but debilitated and possibly fast-disappearing committee to draw attention to one of the most vital parts of the bill <e> <s> i do so protesting on behalf of the opposition that there should be such mismanagement of government business that a part of the bill such as this which gives the secretary of state unprecedented powers over land belonging to local authorities and public bodies throughout the kingdom should be taken at this hour before a committee of this size <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble earl who in the short time he has been addressing this committee has shown so much courtesy <e> <s> but i hope i made it perfectly clear in my remarks that i was not objecting to a register as such <e> <s> i drew special attention to the one sub-paragraph which in my view gives powers far beyond what should be given to central government <e> <s> that is clause <e>", "<cs> as i said i have no intention at this hour i know the committee will not think me discourteous in saying this i have already made my protest of answering the governments case or dealing with it <e> <s> i have tried to analyse the sections of this part which the opposition finds offensive <e> <s> as i said i have no intention of taking from a committee which is not capable of

earl <e> <s> if he tells me that he would prefer to answer me hereafter on this matter either in writing or when we reach another stage i shall understand it completely <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> at this morning the committee was asked to debate before a very much diminished and somewhat fatigued committee powers that the secretary of state was taking to himself in order that he could direct

in the bill <e> <s> my noble friends and i with our liberal colleagues who joined us refused to debate at committee stage such important provisions and such important powers as were being accorded to the secretary of state and we made a protest about the mismanagement of this bill which led to such vital clauses and such vital powers being debated before a much attenuated committee <e> <s> it adds no dignity to this house for our business to be so arranged and apart from adding no dignity it takes away from us the powers which at present we are supposed to exercise and which many people in many

house do not welcome such examples which are being given to opponents of this house <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble minister will be good enough to give way in view of the somewhat summary fashion in which he used his own discretion in defining my questions calling them rhetorical <e> <s> they were not rhetorical they were questions that i specifically asked in my humble judgment for the guidance of the committee <e> <s> i shall repeat them <e> <s> my first question was as follows is there any precedent that the <e>", "<cs> again i ask the minister to give way because this matter

do my duty as a member of this house <e> <s> the first example by way of precedent given to me comes from a brief and i do not wish to be offensive to anybody which if it were given to me in a

confirm this an opportunity for there now to be discussions with the appropriate county councils and his <e>", "<cs> on the terms i mentioned earlier and subject to what the minister said i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a question of solving it on our own or of taking an initiative which the united kingdom with its proud history ought to take as a previous very substantial colonial power <e> <s> is it not a fact that what the minister has been saying this afternoon is really rendering all the investigations of the brandt commission and all the advocacy of

<e>", "<cs> my lords my respect for the noble lord lord sandys is such that i shall immediately take my seat having said to the noble lord lord morris that i was dealing with the sense of the amendment and not its elegance <e> <s> i regard him as distinctly elegant <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean i always think he is sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might present to the house a somewhat different angle although it leads to the same conclusion <e> <s> as i understand it this house has always been keen to prevent the use of dictatorial powers from whatever source they may come <e> <s> therefore this house without regard to the political complexion that a minister might have is anxious not to give him too many powers over the citizen over which the government have jurisdiction in so many respects <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord monson and lord ellen-borough are perhaps content with the remarks that they have made and to which the house has listened <e> <s> but in view of the fact that some political considerations have just been brought into the argument i think that the record ought to be clear from the point of view of these benches <e> <s> that is the only reason i rise to speak <e> <s> it is all very well for a government to talk in terms of a reduction in taxation and lead the citizen to believe that that is really what is happening when with the other hand as it were a provision is written out for a vat which has had a substantial rise and which is costing ordinary little people a dreadful amount because of the necessity of the purchases that they make day by day <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will forgive me if i say that i think this is of some importance <e> <s> i had to try to look after a very old couple who could no longer look after themselves and who wanted to go into a home which was prepared to take them <e> <s> they had not got the money and as noble lords will know there is a local authority grant that is made on some occasions <e> <s> i had to apply for them to this local authority <e> <s> i say at once so that it is seen immediately that i am not trying to make any political point on this that the local authority happened to be a conservative authority and i spoke to a welfare officer who was full of understanding <e> <s> the need of these old people was to be somewhere near their own family outside the boundary of this conservative authority <e> <s> the conservative authority had to say to me we are sorry <e> <s> if you had come to us two years ago we would have been able to give this grant in spite of the fact that the home is outside the area and we would have done it on compassionate grounds <e> <s> but under present restrictions we cannot do it and we are therefore having to turn down old people and doing it in a very substantial way because of the limitations that have been placed upon us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who made that interjection and i noted with some amount of concentration the approval that was given on the government benches to his comments <e> <s> i shall venture to remind the house if none of my colleagues do so that there are certain amendments on which a division took place at committee stage and which were approved <e> <s> i have noticed on the marshalled list that the government have

also have caught him in spite of the way in which he appears to be seated at the moment suspended in mid-air while i ask him this question <e> <s> i ask it only because i think it might clarify the matter for the house as a whole and indeed may save the house and your lordships from possibly listening to some six speeches from me and also perhaps one from the noble baroness lady david <e> <s>

may very well be i am saying no more than this that members of this house would want to know that before they voted on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house although it is my amendment and i think that i am entitled to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so <e> <s> whenever i see my noble friend lord renton nod his head i know that i must be right in agreeing with

before the house <e> <s> i now find myself enmeshed as most likely do other noble lords in some technical language which i should wish to spare the house at this hour <e> <s> once before i referred to

house may at least he clear in regard to its language about which it is always so particular is not a document which is sent in precisely the same form to a number of recipients a circular <e> <s> and if not why is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords with his usual courtesy the noble minister is allowing me to intervene and i am doing it for the sake of brevity <e> <s> i cannot say that the noble minister is preaching to the converted but he is at the moment preaching to someone who has conceded every one of his points in regard to the powers being given to the minister <e> <s> could he please just answer a simple question on the basis of the legal advice that he has been given <e> <s> even if that advice be correct what is the harm of inserting the words that the minister shall consider the representations <e> <s> if he is going to do it anyway what is the harm <e> <s> if he is not going to do it and he does not happen to be a lawyer on looking at the bill he will know that that is his duty <e>", "<cs> i am disconcerted my lords by those very courteous remarks which nevertheless do not appear to support me with great strength <e> <s> i shall not weary the house with further speeches

the bill <e> <s> i cannot see the point of not putting it in and there is legal doubt about it but he gave an answer and i must finish there <e>", "<cs> i said i would be calling out a certain word my lords <e> <s> that word will be content <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might follow as concisely as he did the reasoning of the noble lord lord roberthall and try to limit myself in a submission to the house that it would indeed be an irresponsible body of legislators that could possibly allow this amendment so that the bill stood in the same way as it did before it was amended in committee after a very full discussion and after a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand that <e> <s> i did not think that the department would be employed solely in answering my question <e> <s> if that had been so it would not have been a useful way for the department to employ itself <e> <s> but there was some urgency about this <e>

precedent <e> <s> i should have thought it would have been set out very clearly so that i could have had an answer within hours <e> <s> but it does not matter <e> <s> i only emphasise the fact that the department and the noble lord lord sandys had every opportunity of looking up every precedent that there might be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether with his great courtesy he could tell the house whether he now agrees whatever be the amount invested in new towns that there is no precedent known to his department for this unlimited unqualified power <e>

place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand that the noble lord did not take on board my second point <e> <s> does he admit that much though it be his desire and the present intention of his <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may be permitted to add just a few words to the submission of my noble and learned friend in connection with the hybridity issue <e> <s> it is not often that muses manage to intervene in this house and give us any inspiration to poetry but i must admit that while listening to my noble and learned friend directing his remarks on hybridity to the minister i could not help but think of these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will have listened with considerable sympathy as it always does to

amendment which the noble lord moved at another stage of the bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last occasion possibly that we shall be able to refer to clause of the bill <e> <s> i am so sorry

the house will know my noble friends and i put down an amendment in precisely the same terms as that of the noble lord lord hill of luton except that we added an exhibition centre <e> <s> the noble lord was good enough to say that he approved of the addition <e> <s> it was not subtlety which led us to defer to the noble lord lord hill of luton and leave him to speak to his amendment from the cross-benches <e> <s> it was merely an appreciation that his oratory would most likely be far more successful than anything which i could put over <e> <s> that was a matter which was put to me by my noble friends in no uncertain terms <e> <s> it was in that spirit that the house received the speech of the noble lord lord hill of luton and gave its encouragement to the noble lord the minister to agree to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord the minister will consider the last statement made by my noble friend and we will deal with it after he has given consideration to it possibly through another medium <e>", "<cs> my lords do they in leeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad that i gave way to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter because for the very first time as a newcomer to this house but as one who has so much enjoyed participating with your lordships courtesy in its debates i am able to agree with what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall wait to see if the house divides where the noble lord casts his vote <e> <s> i do not want to repeat what the noble lord has said in much more eloquent and clear terms than i could employ <e> <s> but it so happened that from these benches i too opposed the whole idea of planning fees and i was able on behalf of my noble friends to move an amendment at least to exempt certain classes of planning fees from being charged and the government were good enough to accept that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down would he be good enough to inform the house of the clause in the bill which exempts the three classes to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will be as helpful as he always is <e> <s> if i may be very frank with him the difficulty i find myself in and other members of your lordships house may be in the same difficulty is that we are dealing with a provision which enacts that planning fees may

relates back to the town and country planning act or anything else <e> <s> i am sure that it is my fault and i merely rise to seek clarification and not because i am trying to make a clever point

clearly and read right to the end of that quotation as he will see in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> my lords i did receive an assurance at report stage that this would have the immediate consideration or the fairly immediate consideration of the government <e> <s> that assurance has now been repeated <e> <s> although i would have hoped that something could have been done in the intervening period i think it would be singularly ungracious of me not to withdraw the amendment in the circumstances but i would plead with the government that this is a very important matter that it is essential that the law should be clear on these vital aspects of planning and that i hope that all the consultations will therefore take place with the usual urgency which the government attach to most matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble minister has said nothing which leads me to alter what i previously said to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i make a last appeal for my amendment <e> <s> i do so by trying to bring back the house not to the speeches made in the chamber but to the actual wording of the bill <e> <s> it is a pedestrian remark not really worthy of your lordships intelligence to say that this

national consumer council that <e>", "<cs> my lords is that the only answer <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down and i am sure the house is very grateful to him for a very fine exposition can he comment at all upon the rather dreadful delays which occur with these eec directives <e> <s> one appreciates that they have to have the agreement of a number of states and indeed in the council of ministers i believe unanimous agreement before the directive can be effective <e> <s> but when we are dealing with such vital rights as these have the government decided that

reputation for clarity and for never even getting anywhere near misleading the house wishes to conduct the argument in this way <e> <s> but possibly i will be able to abbreviate this part of my submission to the house by saying that i personally do not understand and no doubt the noble lord will explain to the house what it means when a minister says he accepts that he has a responsibility to reimpose and reconstruct a right of way and then when a local authority endeavours to protect that right by registering a caution he completes a purchase within hours to avoid the local authority putting upon the title the very obligation which the minister now says that he has <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord with his lucid mind will be able to overcome the difficulty but i can only say with all humility that with my humble mind i cannot <e> <s> i find it absolutely i do not want to use too strong a word and i was going to say reprehensible that where an undertaking is

land that the minister is seeking to sell <e> <s> to me this is something that is novel in the governmental life of this country and i do not want to see it repeated <e> <s> i was going to read some more correspondence but i can observe the clock and <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends are always very kind to me but noble lords opposite are possibly not so willing <e> <s> but perhaps your

good enough to deal with the point made by my noble friend lady birk which to some of us seems to be extremely important <e> <s> the minister was at pains to say that at least per cent <e> <s> of those upon whom this increase would fall would be able to get it back by way of supplementary benefit and by means of the normal rent rebate scheme <e> <s> it seems to my noble friend and it seems to me also to be a somewhat extraordinary way of saving money if what you have to do is to take something from one pocket of the government in order to put it in another <e> <s> when we deal with the per cent <e> <s> would not the minister agree that to some of us this seems to be somewhat extraordinary economics <e> <s> so far as they are concerned it represents a very substantial increase in their cost of living and therefore affects wage claims and the policy of restricting wage claims which the government understandably have in order to assist us in our fight against inflation <e> <s> i wonder whether for the benefit of those of us who are interested in the economy of the country the minister would deal with both of those points <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only proper that i should thank the minister for his courtesy in repeating a statement made by his right honourable friend in another place but i am sure that he will not expect me to congratulate him on that statement <e> <s> only yesterday the minister talked very proudly of certain local government announcements that were made to which he said some of the local authority associations agreed and all the local authority associations had been consulted and had expressed a view <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble minister leaves this point i wonder whether i may ask him if this afternoon he would kindly not deal with the sins of other governments but only with the virtues of his own <e> <s> would he therefore kindly say whether or not there will be an allowance made whatever other governments may have done <e>", "<cs> many of us have been confounded before and therefore looked at phillimore with relief by the use of the word imminent <e> <s> one notices that the amendment although very frankly spoken to as

intervene but briefly only to introduce what is possibly a fresh issue <e> <s> there is a very precious principle that we have been discussing the whole time on this bill and that is the issue of freedom of speech <e> <s> a prosecution under this bill and obviously the bill must provide for the causes for such prosecution because there are other valuable liberties at stake is a serious matter

principle of law that ought to be enunciated at this moment it is that editors and other citizens of this country whether they be unfortunate whether they be malicious whether they be wicked

that to omit this clause creates even more uncertainty than the clause itself that must be an option we cannot take <e> <s> we therefore come back to the clause itself to see whether or not we can make it more certain <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and only because his speeches are always so clear may i ask him to clarify two points he made <e> <s> first is it not a fact that where a taxpayer owns two residences he can at this moment elect with the inland revenue to choose one of them as his main residence <e> <s> does not that answer one of the noble lords points <e>

law he would not be able to vote in scotland even though his landed interest in scotland was a very pertinent electoral issue <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that a question-and-answer session is not the appropriate way in which to deal with matters of which this house is not fully apprised and of which the house has heard no evidence whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords one always listens with the greatest of respect to the words that fall from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> if i <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend was gracious enough to remind the house that this was an amendment that i moved on committee <e> <s> the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack was equally gracious at the end of the discussion

venture another view from the one which has just been put before your lordships <e> <s> this happens to be an age some of us may think of leakages <e> <s> some of us may think that some of the principles that we grew up with have flown out of the window principles of the loyalty of partners and the loyalty of employees <e> <s> some of us may think that disclosures are made which contain only half the truth if even that fraction is achieved and which do an amazing amount of harm when published in the newspapers <e> <s> some people may think of journals or weekly periodicals that have not got the best reputation but have a circulation which is based purely and simply upon the amazing revelations which are made in which peoples reputations are torn to tatters leaving them with only the remedy of a writ for libel if they wish to go through the courts and have what sometimes appears to be the inevitable apology at the end of the day but with people saying all the way round but you know there is no smoke without fire <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i can help the noble lord <e> <s> at the very outset of my speech i made it abundantly clear that i was putting before the house most humbly a personal point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i have intentionally removed myself from a bench which i do not say that i grace but which has graced me until now in order that there can be no doubt whatever that my speech to your lordships is based upon a personal view and a personal view only <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord goes to another point will he kindly deal with something which is worrying us <e> <s> where in this bill which is supposed to clarify the law of contempt you deliberately deal with the question of juries and publications in regard to juries is it obviously not desirable to cover the matters dealt with by this amendment which the noble and learned lord seems to think are desirable but which are now dealt with on a voluntary basis <e> <s> i did not follow his argument in regard to not including this in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords a clause of the industry bill now before the house deals with the engineering profession

reading the bill itself this is certainly not apparent and that therefore it would mean that any other minister taking over from the present minister and finding the wording of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords while all of us i think in this house this afternoon are endeavouring to exercise the utmost constraint and very sensibly so in the present position would the noble earl not think it ungracious

not clumsiness elsewhere <e>", "<cs> before the committee gets too drastically serious and both sides stare at each other with a ferocity far greater than that of any bull staring at a rambler may i beg of the front bench opposite not to take an unfair political advantage <e> <s> at general election time supporters of my party in rural areas wearing rosettes of a similar colour to the handkerchief which the noble earl lord gowrie is wearing at the moment run a far greater risk than supporters of the party opposite with the colour of their rosettes <e> <s> therefore i ask noble lords opposite not to take an unfair political advantage and will they kindly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble baroness for only one reason <e> <s> the house always delights to hear her and she has just mentioned the abolition of the registry of companies <e> <s> i know that she meant the registry of business names and i do not want the house to misunderstand her <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the debate tonight i do not think that the government need any opposition in this house <e> <s> therefore out of sheer mercy i shall try to use as kindly language as i can when dealing with this bill <e> <s> it is such a pleasure to be able to congratulate a professional colleague like the noble lord lord noel-buxton on his maiden speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said that it was a rare characteristic of the legal profession to have the clarity of speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely that to which i wish to refer because i listened to the noble lord very carefully <e> <s> he said that he belongs to a profession where clarity is not always the main characteristic and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with his usual speed has spoilt the whole purpose of my next comment which was to refer to the fact that the noble lord lord noel-buxton belongs to a different branch of the profession from the one <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to continue his most elegant simile may i say that it has to do with fiddling <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord again and i promise not to keep on doing so but this is an important point <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that the government are relying upon the self-regulatory procedure and that they have no intention whatsoever of coming forward with legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will forgive me for a moment only because he has made the very proud claim that all practical documents are in fact covered whereas the act is out of date <e> <s> does he realise that the one thing of terrific interest to a supplier is an order form <e> <s> when a supplier receives an order he wants to know who it is who is ordering and whether he ought really to deal with the person <e> <s> does he know that an order form is not included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i said the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister consider referring the governments economic policy to the monopolies commission bearing in mind the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister with his usual quick witty reaction has answered my question by a definition of monopoly <e> <s> does he not realise that i was saying that the governments view was a monopoly to itself since nobody else was allowed to share it

judges have been elevated and not <e> <s> i thought it only right although it goes against me to point that out <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i think with great respect and most unusually for him he has become somewhat confused with his figures <e> <s> what i said was that six circuit judges had been appointed to the high court bench and that there were solicitors who were circuit judges <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord quite unusually for him but possibly because of his poor accountancy which he frankly confessed has got the figures rather muddled up <e>", "<cs> if we may revert from the world stage to the rather narrower conception of the supreme court bill and the even narrower one of clause the noble and learned lord lord diplock disclosed his objective attitude to the amendment by saying that his father was a solicitor <e> <s> may i say to him at once that this is well remembered with affection in my own profession <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord roskill said that his son was a solicitor and therefore he must be objective about this <e> <s> may i equally record that his son is held in great respect in my profession <e> <s> but i have a double objectivity <e> <s> i have a son who is a solicitor and a daughter who is a barrister and therefore i hope that it will be assumed immediately that i too have an objectivity although i ought to disclose that neither of them has as yet told me that he or she has an ambition even to be a circuit court judge <e>", "<cs> possibly because i have such supreme faith in the ability of the noble and learned lord to circumvent all difficulties as he is prepared to have those further discussions i beg leave at this stage to withdraw the amendment and i shall see what my <e>", "<cs> the sole point of my talking about clause for a moment is to see whether or not subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will be good enough to give a view if he can today on the possible addition to clause of the powers that can be exercised by the criminal division of the court of appeal <e> <s> i say that especially because of the decision in <e>", "<cs> i should be more than content with any appeal to the court of appeal whether civil or criminal <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lords who have helped me <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not be accused of over-subtlety in bringing up a point on clause as now proposed to be amended <e> <s> i am looking at subsection which reads <e>", "<cs> i have a very brief point <e> <s> clause deals with the exercise of high court jurisdiction otherwise than by judges of that court <e> <s> if the committee will be kind enough to refer to subsection <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> it will save the committees time if i say that in other places in the bill the words officers of the court are mentioned without any reference to legal qualifications <e> <s> i shall not burden the committee with a repetition of my point each time it occurs but possibly the noble and learned lord would look at it from the point of view of the use of that expression throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be permitted to put a contrary point of view only so that the committee hears one word against the amendment <e> <s> if somebody were courageous enough to put down an amendment to the effect that no civil case should be tried by a jury except with the leave of the judge who would then be expected to go into all the issues on the pleadings and to deal with the matter on the basis of justice between the parties one of whom presumably has applied for a jury i should be content <e> <s> what makes me most unhappy is to give the right to some people and to debar others on the basis of the estimate of time that a trial may take <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would permit me to deal with two points that he raised in answer to the very persuasive argument of the noble lord lord foot in support of the amendment down in his name with which he has also allowed me the privilege of associating my name <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has said that in principle he sees merit in the case but there are two matters which he commented upon in particular <e> <s> the first was the possible unfair attitude towards the official solicitor approach to this matter and the second was the question of expense <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it would be highly undesirable if his right honourable friend did have such a policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will be kind enough to explain something only for my own edification because it may be that other noble lords have seen the point of it already <e> <s> would he be good enough to explain why it is that the words during such period as may be specified for each step which is amendment no <e> <s> are necessary <e> <s> i did not catch his explanation of that in the very useful remarks that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i bow to the minister and i am anxious not to waste the time of the house but i did not quite understand that that was the reason for the exclusion of these words from the definition clause <e>", "<cs> i think that is so and i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might intervene for a moment and keep talking while a certain note reaches the noble lord as a result of which he may be able to enlighten the committee and we can move on <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly because as usual the noble lord lord mottistone brought a bit of lightness and fun to our proceedings late at night <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord the lord advocate when replying to this debate indicate whether it is not a fact because i personally have a great deal of sympathy with the point that he raised only to be answered by the fact that the directive had this and there we are and these things have to be included in the report that a directive in its draft form was available not only to her majestys opposition but to the great confederation of british industry <e> <s> would he indicate to the committee whether any representations were made by either of those worthy bodies namely her majsetys opposition at that time or the confederation of british industry who are supposed to be very observant of these matters criticising these provisions in the directive so that her majestys government were asked to make representations <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that the cbi should take this view and i mean that in all seriousness <e> <s> because of the weight of opinion behind this principle and the weight of argument and logic and because as i have said nobody wants to give a licence to confidence tricksters i hope that the government at the very least will say that they are prepared to consider this matter between now and the report stage in which case i with equal graciousness will ask leave to withdraw the amendment and see what comes up at the report stage <e> <s> i hope that will be the answer that i shall be given <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord boardman and to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the support that they have given to this amendment <e> <s> i am somewhat downcast although not entirely surprised by the reply given by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i say that for the following reason <e> <s> the point made just now by the noble lord lord boardman was absolutely correct <e> <s> the view which i am about to express is shared by the law society and by the bar council and i beg of the noble and

sure that he would to the views of the bar council and the law society of england <e> <s> the experience of those of us who are in practice and who deal with company matters is that our only complaint is that we might have had to wait rather a long time before we heard from the registrar that a name was approved <e> <s> however i can assure the noble and learned lord that our experience of the registrar of companies department is that very few cases of confusion have crept through <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord the minister coming to a new point <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to complete a thought or a sentence i would not be rude enough to interrupt him at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i interpret that as a welcome to my intervention or not <e> <s> i would ask the minister to help me on this <e> <s> i am not sure other members of the committee may be what he means by objections received by the registrar <e> <s> does he mean objections received by people who thought that the names that were being registered were rather similar to their own <e> <s> i am not sure what he is referring to as objections <e> <s> possibly the noble lord could tell the committee <e>", "<cs> objections against what <e>", "<cs> i know the noble lord is anxious to help the committee that is why i am pursuing the point <e> <s> i gather he is bringing forward that figure as showing how ably the registrar manages to deal with names because there are only objections on any ground from other people to the effect that he has done the job badly in which case i welcome the point and i am sure all those who are in favour of my amendment will welcome it as strengthening our case <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but is he saying that that shows that the registrar has done an extremely good job in sifting these things out beforehand <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not detaining the committee but i rise only because i am looking at line and i am trying awfully hard to delete line and make sense of this amendment <e> <s> i find myself confused beyond confusion <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that the noble lord after further reflection will wish to withdraw the amendment that he has now moved after having withdrawn the amendment that he previously moved <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not be accused by the committee and certainly not by the front bench opposite of making cheap debating points <e> <s> this is not meant to be that type of point at all <e> <s> however i want to point out to the committee again the really clumsy thinking and i must be forgiven for using the phrase as regards the way in which the extremely important provisions in part ii have been dealt with <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is indebted for a very clear explanation of the group of amendments and we have been saved several speeches <e> <s> we are obliged to the minister for that <e> <s> my speech will also be very short <e> <s> it is limited to the point which is made in amendment no <e> <s> namely the inclusion of the words or any profession <e> <s> i am much obliged to the minister for indicating as an example the splendid profession of the law society and that of solicitors connected with that profession <e> <s> i am sure that solicitors and other well-known professions are grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord mackay will know as will other members of the committee that the word client was understood in and until fairly recently <e> <s> now everyone including grocers candlestick-makers and so on has clients they no longer have customers <e> <s> in exactly the same way i am afraid that the word profession has been somewhat minimised in our vocabulary and there are many who seek to come within that category who should never be in it <e> <s> i think that in we must ensure that we know that for which we are legislating <e>", "<cs> on second reading i made the point that an order form was of particular importance because the person to whom the order was directed was keen to know who was in charge of the business that was trying to order something from him so that he could decide whether credit should be given and whether it was sensible to supply that business <e> <s> do the government agree that in the bill as drafted an order form is a document on which the particulars of the principals and so on do not have to appear <e> <s> if so whatever be the ultimate wording of an amendment either on report or hereafter do the government agree that order forms should be among the documents on which it should be mandatory that the particulars appear <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether upon that note which the noble and learned lord sounded of government encouragement to what is a brave initiative in this field and to an amendment for which the committee is deeply grateful because it has been a most interesting debate i may say this <e> <s> the noble and learned lord caught the spirit of the committee in wanting to further the principle behind the amendment and very correctly referred to the general policy in certain clauses of this bill which would make what i think will inevitably be called jocs something better known and something practised <e>", "<cs> i must persist but only for one moment because i do not want to bore the committee <e> <s> this is an important matter and we do not want this debate to resolve itself into mere print upon pages with all of us praising ourselves tonight for the speeches we have made and the matter resting there <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is a very frank person and i do not think that he would put forward to the committee that the reasons for looking at section and ultimately for looking at section and at the whole idea of a companys ability to purchase shares were specifically in relation to our debate on these amendments <e> <s> there were many other reasons why the government had quite properly to look at those provisions and to bring in

judgment and i shall be corrected if i am wrong regards the debate we have just had as very valuable <e> <s> as has been pointed out not one speaker and we have heard speakers of great experience has spoken against the proposals <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has given very good reasons in my judgment as to why it is not appropriate to legislate within this companies act for a specific type of company <e> <s> i do not want to argue with him about that he has given very good reasons why we should not have another table a i think that point is debatable but i do not want to argue about it <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord i am sure not intentionally has evaded the one question which i put to him <e>", "<cs> i entirely echo the words of my noble friend lord ponsonby but i want to ask two questions which could help in considering the two clauses <e> <s> although the committee could not be consulted before now on these clauses because they have only just been put in as amendments can the noble and learned lord inform us whether the stock exchange the institute of chartered accountants the law society and the bar council have had the opportunity of making representations on the clauses <e> <s> i think that the answer to that may facilitate our own consideration of the situation before reaching report stage <e> <s> i confess to the noble and learned lord that my second question might result <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee and i shall not do so for more than a second or so but what the noble lord lord wedderburn has said conveys the feeling of a number of members that it is awfully difficult to carry out our duties properly in the circumstances which i do not intend to repeat or to complain about again <e> <s> may i make this respectful suggestion <e> <s> normally when you have got a complicated bill of this kind you have notes on the clauses <e> <s> i am wondering whether between now and report stage your lordships would

create new law <e> <s> if a document however roughly prepared could be issued to the members of the committee and especially those who are interested <e>", "<cs> i intervene not in any way to cast any

such a deep respect especially those of us who happen to be engaged in the profession which he has graced <e>", "<cs> i do not have to go to new zealand to know what the reaction of the ordinary human beings may be <e> <s> whatever may be the experience in new zealand of which we have no evidence before the committee i can only say that people either ought to be admitted into the bond of marriage

no sympathy whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to set an example to the legal profession with the humility with which i speak i dare not say an example to learned judges in that i shall certainly not take even minutes in dealing with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would be churlish to refuse an offer of this kind <e> <s> i understand the offer to be and the noble and learned lord will correct me

be dealt with <e> <s> with that in mind he would be happy to see that members of his department have consultations with the law society with even the possibility which i know would be so much welcomed

served upon me in the precincts of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord will forgive me for intervening but the point to which he has referred was one which i made at the committee stage and not today <e> <s> i deliberately did not make that point today because of the noble and learned lords comments last time <e>", "<cs> my lords i did of course say in my few remarks that the royal commission on legal services had made recommendations along the lines of this amendment <e> <s> i apologise to the house if the wording of my amendment is not as clear as precise and as limited as on reflection i think it should have been <e> <s> therefore i hope that when the noble and learned lord at least reconsiders this matter although he has made his position fairly clear he will have in mind a more favourable view that might be taken if the wording were tidied up and the limitations were in accordance with some of his own suggestions <e> <s> upon that basis and living as i always do in hope i ask leave of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may add a thought in view of the noble and learned lords comments on

to have to express my astonishment at the noble and learned lords defence of a closed shop in his own particular profession and i find it absolutely remarkable that i should have listened to such a speech <e> <s> having listened to it i as always admire the eloquence expressed <e> <s> if i may say so i wish i could equally admire the logic behind the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that solicitors are supposed to be good at drafting and possibly in some cases superior to counsel i have been humbled tonight to find that my drafting is not of the best <e> <s> however obviously i am delighted with the noble and learned lords remarks and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall never be accused of being uncharitable to my fellow members <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was very kind in referring to the piece of history that i made not with a very successful outcome <e> <s> in view of what has been said and because of the number of those present in your lordships house at this moment it would be wrong of me to carry the matter any further now <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we support the amendment and the law society support it <e> <s> i have nothing to add <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the better opinion of those experienced in london government and by that i mean those who agree with my point of view <e> <s> the statement that he has made today represents a very retrogade step in more ways than one <e> <s> is he aware that local government in this country can scareely be deemed to be democratic local government where the minister has to announce that when the glc called upon eight local authorities to take a transfer of the housing stock all eight of them declined to do so and the minister has decided after what is termed somewhat euphemistically consultation to order them to take the stock <e> <s> is that what he means by consultation <e> <s> is that what he thinks is democratic local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i embarrass the front bench opposite by an elasticity that i promise to bring to an end <e> <s> is the minister aware that one of the great advantages in regard to the officers of the great glc not as great as the old lcc but still great was the ability to offer housing to officers who otherwise might not be available in the service of london <e> <s> will that not be spoiled by the present order <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that verbal encouragement to local authorities is scarcely of use when one faces a moratorium and a cut in finance which does not enable those authorities to repair some of the empty houses and therefore let them <e> <s> furthermore does he agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will forgive me if i come back to the question of repairs which is a vital matter in connection with these empty houses that we are dealing with <e> <s> can he not consider making some priority grants in order to enable repairs to be carried out having regard to the housing crisis that exists in many parts of the country although other areas may have surpluses and would he not regard that even on the basis of a once-for-all grant as something which is worth while to deal with this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard the expression that half a loaf is better than none but i feel that i <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister i am sure does not wish to mislead the house <e> <s> i made it absolutely clear that this occurred during the time when there was industrial trouble in the registry and when therefore what the government now seek to do was in fact the

in view of what the noble lord the minister has said and with as much gracious <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the slightest doubt but that section whether coming before the judges of the chancery division to whom the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made such a touching reference a moment ago or whether coming before lawyers who are endeavouring to advise those who lend and those who borrow has been a devastating section not necessarily devastating for the legal profession but certainly for their clients <e> <s> it has been extremely difficult to advise on what transactions are caught by section and what are not and the decisions which have so far come down to us have if anything added a tortuous element to what is already an extremely difficult clause to interpret <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to be a nuisance to the noble and learned lord but following upon the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has spoken with typical modesty which is much beloved in this house because it is associated so much with his name as he has piloted this bill to its first port of call <e> <s> we on this side most certainly wish that it should go with all speed for the rest of its voyage into another place and on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will as always be grateful to the noble lord the minister for the clear lucid way in which he has dealt with a very technical bill <e> <s> there are however implications in this bill which i hope in fairly simple language can be made abundantly clear to all members of this house <e> <s> if i myself understand what i am saying i hope that your lordships will equally find my words intelligible <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept from someone in your lordships house who was born in that area who spent his youth there and who represented it on the london county council and the greater london council for over years a sense of horror at what took place over the last weekend <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister also take it from someone who knows this area well that any preconceived judgment which i am sure my noble friend lord gifford did not seek to make but it might be inferred that he did about the police being responsible by harassment or otherwise for troubles is not shared by many in your lordships house <e> <s> finally will the minister take it for granted that we shall await the recommendations which i hope will be positive with very great interest and with very great concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only because my name has been mentioned <e> <s> i hope that like my noble friend lord gifford i not only read and study but that i go into the courts and i would not at all agree with his interpretaton of my remarks unless he agrees that that

these benches say that they have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but it is only so that my noble friend can continue the argument factually correct <e> <s> what i said was that the home secretary had said in another place that one of the reasons for getting rid of sus was that in less than charges were brought in the united kingdom under the sus law <e> <s> i then went on to say that only a proportion of that number could be motor vehicle cases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene if only so that the argument is quite clear <e> <s> if this is the point the noble lord takes then with respect would he not also be prepared to consider not necessarily this afternoon if i have perhaps caught him by surprise the inclusion in the law of an attempt which if proved in regard to something which could apply to any one of these three cases would still be an offence committed under the law <e> <s> in other words in the same way as he has in this provision one of three cases which could relate to any one once you have proved the act had been done could this not equally be dealt with in regard to another provision in regard to attempt <e> <s> then one would get to the stage of an attempt in the law instead of the pre-stage which clause provides for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has been very gracious in the last remarks that he made <e> <s> my criticism with respect was not in <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time has the noble and learned lord fulfilled a very useful public service and as we have learned this afternoon it will not be the last time he will be fulfilling a great public service <e> <s> i imagine he heard the acclamation with which his name was greeted this afternoon when we heard of the important duty he is now to undertake <e> <s> my lords this is a useful bill and as the noble and learned lord said it is a non-controversial one <e> <s> we on these benches hope that it will have a speedy voyage without anybody seeking to interfere with its course until it safely reaches port <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether with the leave of the house i may be allowed to comment on what the noble earl the deputy leader of the house has just said <e> <s> in the first instance may i assure him if any assurance is necessary that we on our side of the house will always to the best of our ability abide by the rules of procedure and the great traditions in this house <e> <s> but i would most respectfully submit although obviously we are all of us in the hands of the house itself that the amendment to which the noble earl referred in no way breaches the principle which he read out <e> <s> may i also say that if in any way it is held to breach it and i repeat i like him am in the hands of the house the government themselves have brought this upon their own shoulders <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be doing less than my duty were i to concede to that request by the minister <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the argument <e> <s> i have already said that we should not put at risk the business community of this country including the small business which we are all anxious to look after especially at this stage

on the register <e> <s> i am now communicating with the minister <e> <s> to allow that situation is in my view impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will forgive me but it might make the discussion rather easier if i were to intervene <e> <s> i especially did not define the local authority because i did not want to be hoist with my own petard by it being said the county councils cannot do it hut of course the district councils could <e> <s> so i deliberately left it in general terms trying to get the principle through and i thought the minister would understand that <e> <s> the local authority could be decided upon quite easily thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and i am not now answering the debate but answering a question may i tell the noble earl that the idea of this amendment is i think precisely what he has in mind <e> <s> under the bill there will be a requirement for certain particulars to be shown at the place of business <e> <s> that will be an obligation of everybody conducting a firm because the old register of business names will go under the bill <e> <s> we will start off with a new registration of those particulars <e> <s> a precise copy of those particulars will go to the local authority <e> <s> therefore throughout the country there will be or ought to be observance of this new provision and this will mean that there will be although scattered throughout the country per cent <e> <s> correct up-to-date registration of the particulars of firms <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that the short winding-up speech that i promised will deal largely with the last point made <e> <s> if to send a carbon copy of something which you are obliged by an act of parliament to prepare in any event is so onerous then we are all of us saddled in our daily life with obligations so onerous that one would have thought it almost impossible to attend this house at all as a result of them <e> <s> all that i ask for is merely a copy of what is already there to be sent to the local authority <e> <s> this is a straightforward issue <e> <s> i do not intend to complicate it <e> <s> it is the last opportunity of those who are fearful of doing away with all registration of business names available in any public place for people to search and apply for copies <e> <s> it is the last opportunity that this house will have to try in some measure to protect the public in this way <e> <s> i can put it no higher but i certainly put it no lower <e> <s> i regard it if i may say so as the duty of all those who have favoured this principle in past debates to decide to support this amendment now <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him in the midst of his not indecent but eccentric display will he kindly take it from me that many members i should have thought nearly all the members of the party which he adorns are delighted to be associated with conservative members in this bill <e>", "<cs> the minister with his usual courtesy wrote to me in a most considerate manner explaining the reason for the various amendments and therefore calling my attention to their necessity from a drafting point of view <e> <s> i should like to thank him because it has saved the committee a speech from me and various questions which i otherwise might have asked <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord renton will forgive me for intervening but i wish to point out that in moving the amendment i did not at all mention the ethnic minority point <e> <s> i listened most carefully to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and i did not hear him mention that point as being a reason why we should pass the amendment <e> <s> i do not want the committee to be misled into thinking that this is part of the case <e>", "<cs> i intervene in order to answer the noble lords sensible point <e> <s> may i say that if it were outside the vehicle and somebody did what he has suggested it would be attempted theft and there would be no need to invoke this section at all <e> <s> therefore there is no question of two acts of interference applying <e> <s> the doubt when you are dealing with a vehicle and you have to enter the vehicle in order to commit the offence would be whether it was an attempt to take and drive away the vehicle or to steal it <e> <s> that was the problem of the past <e> <s> there has never been a problem over anything attached to a vehicle <e>", "<cs> i shall not weary the committee with a repetition of the arguments but in justice to the amendment i must deal with some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> may i first of all impinge upon the courtesy of the committee by telling a story that has definitely stayed with me throughout my professional life a true story in which i was engaged <e> <s> possibly the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson will now appreciate why i said what i did as would my noble friend lady wootton if she were in her place <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly merely to say that everybody has agreed the noble lord lord renton as one would expect of him has agreed that a lead must be given to the courts in regard to shorter sentences <e> <s> the home secretary has made some very eloquent speeches on the matter <e> <s> i remember reading one speech of his in february last in which he made this abundantly clear <e> <s> the may committee when dealing with the matter of prisons also made it abundantly clear that they agreed with this <e> <s> it was a home office advisory committee which sat in that made this recommendation <e> <s> speeches are very effective with those who happen to hear them though possibly <e>", "<cs> my lords many extraordinary things can happen at this hour and i should be the last to complain if my noble friend lord davies of leek took my place in the list <e> <s> indeed i think that it might be much more entertaining for your lordships if he did <e> <s> the other dreadful thing in speaking at this hour is that one is not in the mood for compliments <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to express quite sincerely on behalf i am sure of the house our gratitude to the noble lord lord evans for bringing this important matter to our attention and for the very clear and lucid way which is typical of him in which he outlined his own views and some of the problems that still obtain in regard to leasehold reform <e> <s> it befits no one <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i never gave the impression to the noble lord or to any member of the house that i referred to them disparagingly <e> <s> on the contrary i welcomed the fact that they were the rent assessment committees by another name and would deal with these matters informally with local knowledge and i hoped would remove some of the anomalies that existed <e> <s> the last thing in the world i would want to do is anything to disparage them <e> <s> i wish them well <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord the minister would be good enough to deal a little more fully with the very potent point made by my noble friend lord underhill <e> <s> it is not a question of dealing with policy <e> <s> it is a question of dealing as a matter of respect with parliament <e> <s> if it be a fact that there was some doubt about the utilisation of the previous power which necessitated for the purposes of clarity and for the purpose of effectiveness a clause in this bill which was debated at very considerable length in another place is the noble lord the minister saying that the approach which was made with regard to the sale of these hotels and their purchase and the formation of a new private company which was announced yesterday was so infinitely commercially desirable that it was something that had to be entered into immediately and could not wait for the ordinary performance of parliamentary duties in order to see whether this power should in the end be contained in this bill <e>", "<cs> i ask the pardon of the noble lord the minister for interrupting him <e> <s> i would not have done it were it not that he said something just now which was extremely serious and i am sure he did it on information that was before him <e> <s> i am not able to read from the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i apologise to the committee but this is a very important matter of principle <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister now saying that what he said before namely that ministerial consent was not required was i am sure inadvertently inaccurate and if not how does he please distinguish between the words acquisition and purchase <e> <s> because in ordinary english i do not know the difference <e>", "<cs> i am so glad that i have the acclamation of the noble baroness lady gaitskell that means that i am half way home <e> <s> the first proposition is that it is the governments own statement of policy that a minority interest is to be retained the second point is that if that is so it must be a minority interest surely which does not just have burdens and risks attached to it but has certain minimal rights although they are not the rights of a controlling shareholder <e> <s> we have already dealt with that in a short debate <e>", "<cs> as usual i find myself in the position that other noble lords have made my points for me very much better than i would have been able to make <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say that we are in entire agreement with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could help some of us who are very worried about this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone made his remarks in his usual charming way immedi <e>", "<cs> the minister has as one would expect given a correct explanation <e> <s> indeed i imagine it would be most unusual for an acquirer of a subsidiary company to do anything other than vest his new subsidiary in his own concern for example when one is thinking in terms of the hotel industry <e> <s> secondly as i am sure the noble viscount knows the revenue would not permit one to go on with the pension rights of a previous employer to be admitted for revenue purposes it would have to be the present employers scheme <e> <s> thirdly i think i am right in saying that all the employees of subsidiaries would be members of the main british rail pension fund and there would not necessarily be separate pension funds for each subsidiary <e> <s> i imagine that is the position <e>", "<cs> as the committee will have anticipated it is with some sorrow that i see the intransigence <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for those comforting words if that is the appropriate term with which to describe them <e> <s> with great respect to the noble earl i will just say that part of my affection for this chamber is that it is supposed to be a revising chamber <e> <s> therefore one hopes that more wisdom may prevail here than prevails elsewhere <e> <s> one does not necessarily anticipate precisely the same replies here as ministers give in another place <e> <s> at least something has been said today which possibly brings a little comfort and i shall await the further outcome of the noble earls promised consideration before deciding what i shall do at another stage <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can only hope that the same consideration of what has been said in regard to this amendment will be given by the noble earl as he promised he might do in the case of the last amendment <e> <s> in that hope i ask the committees leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obviously most grateful to the noble earl for those words <e>", "<cs> in order to show how different is the front bench on this side we have no objection to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the leader of the house take it for granted that this question is meant only to be helpful <e> <s> reverting to the point that was made by the noble baroness lady wootton does he not know that a refusal of arbitration whether by a union or an employer is taken by the public to be a sign of weakness by those who refuse an arbitration <e> <s> would he not accept that most employers when they do go to arbitration make the point that as a result of either their lack of profits or the size of them they cannot afford to make any higher offer <e> <s> could it not be a term of reference to any arbitrator that the governments point about inability to afford more in the national interest is a matter which should be looked into by the arbitrator perfectly fairly <e>", "<cs> there have been at least two speeches made against the amendment and i should like to intervene briefly in order that the arguments for the amendment should not be forgotten <e> <s> i do not intend to repeat those arguments <e> <s> i want to answer if i may from my point of view the arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> always one hears the case of the person who may be suffering an injustice the case of the driver very properly and fairly put who has three endorsable offences connected with one really substantial offence <e> <s> since there will have to be points awarded in respect of each one the point is made that it would be unjust for the carry-forward to take place when indeed at present the law is that if there be but one incident and there is more than one endorsable offence connected with it it counts only as one conviction for the purpose of the totting-up procedure <e>", "<cs> i rise only so that for the convenience of the committee all the arguments can be dealt with at once instead of us popping up one after the <e>", "<cs> i will not weary the committee and i promise not to repeat this point again but could the noble and learned lord deal with this point to save me repeating it <e> <s> on the application for disqualification the noble and learned lord is saying that that is the time when the court has all the facts before it and it should take into account the whole history of how the or excess of points have been accumulated <e> <s> i am saying and the noble and learned lord has not answered this that his argument is wrong false and misleading but through no intention of his whatsoever because nobody would ever accuse the noble and learned lord of any such behaviour it is purely inadvertent <e> <s> however the committee is being misled because the court under the wording of subsection cannot go into the question of whether previous points have accumulated through a serious or a not serious offence or whether a previous disqualification has taken place by virtue of serious or not serious offences or whether or not hardship has been involved at all <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord can show that i am wrong on that i shall wear a penitents gown of white and apologise to him but if i am not wrong would he please deal with the argument <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down the example i gave of reckless driving was not that of the doctor it was the case that could happen unfortunately to any one of us that of a child of ours who was dangerously ill and we then exceeded the speed limit in a dangerous way by really going it in our motor vehicle in order to get the child to a hospital or to a doctor <e> <s> that is what i said and i said that we now have an obligatory points system which will make the court whatever the circumstances order points <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord says that this is really the limit of what he can say and that to say any more would not be right <e> <s> he is saying by inference that it is impossible to define what hardship is and what exceptional hardship is <e> <s> it will be for each and every magistrates court to decide it and we get back to the uniformity which quite frankly is what we are trying awfully hard to get in regard to the justice that the court administers and the penalties in regard to which we are trying to get uniformity if we possibly can especially when we are dealing with serious penalties <e>", "<cs> before the committee hears whether or not the amendment is to be withdrawn would the noble lord the minister agree that there is a great body of opinion at the moment which is terribly anxious to assist in saving the time of the police of court officials and others and that there is a great interest in relieving the crowded lists in magistrates courts in order that serious cases may be dealt with rather more speedily <e> <s> is he really of the opinion therefore that it is quite impossible within the time allotted to this bill to bring in the procedure which is suggested under this very sensible amendment <e> <s> i would hope that the minister would regard this as sufficiently important for him to give a more positive reply especially as we all know that before another bill of this kind can come before parliament a very considerable amount of time is bound to elapse not least because of the crowded legislative programme <e>", "<cs> i intervene merely in order that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate can deal with the very sound point which has been made by the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth <e> <s> since he was courteous enough to address his question to me as well as to the noble and learned lord opposite it may help if i say that it is a matter of practical experience that police forces throughout the country vary greatly regarding this offence <e> <s> some of them even after a death has been caused will prosecute for driving without due care and attention while others will prosecute for reckless driving even when there is no serious injury if they think that the facts constitute reckless driving <e> <s> it is a matter which causes a great deal of concern among those who are charged with the duty of defending motorists <e>", "<cs> i only ask that when your lordships consider what view should be taken in regard to this amendment you will bear in mind a point that has not been mentioned so far but which your lordships may remember from a previous debate namely that the seriousness or otherwise of the offence cannot be taken into account by a subsequent court when dealing with the question of disqualification <e>", "<cs> at the risk of boring the committee i promise for only one minute may i repeat that the committee have already sanctioned another provision of this bill which says that the seriousness or otherwise of this offence cannot be mentioned on a disqualification application <e> <s> in those circumstances the committee will appreciate the situation <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down he made one comment and i wonder whether he will allow a brief question <e> <s> he said that the matter of points would be of no concern unless one of course committed another offence and therefore had points that added up to the disqualification total <e> <s> with great respect does he really think that insurance companies will not at some time ask on a proposal form how many points a driver has against him when assessing the question of the insurable risk and the premium to be charged <e>", "<cs> may i tell the noble lord the minister that he has exceeded the speed limit and deserves in my view the maximum amount of points to be awarded against him <e> <s> these are an entirely new type of regulations <e> <s> the noble lord opposite has made the point much more effectively than i could and does so with much greater experience <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree in the circumstances that it would be sensible to consider the point made with such force by the noble lord opposite and also dealt with by my noble friend lord underhill and possibly write to both noble lords before report stage in order to see whether the affirmative procedure is not after all the sensible course <e> <s> may i suggest that the noble lord the minister adopts that course and instead of reading at great speed and quoting a number of sections and subsections which i think really exhausted all of us including himself would he not think this a more suitable way of dealing with this amendment <e>", "<cs> would not the noble lord the minister think that the time of the court would be saved if in these circumstances there was this fixed penalty <e>", "<cs> this is a private members bill and as such as my noble friend lord houghton knows nothing that is said from this front bench in any way commits any one of my noble friends sitting either by the side of me or behind me <e> <s> having said that may i challenge the view that in regard to this bill and in regard to the specific amendment that we are discussing the question of the liberty of the individual is an essential matter for us to consider <e> <s> to confuse the word liberty with the word licence is a mistake which has often been made and you do not preserve liberty by confusing it with licence <e> <s> to talk in terms of preserving liberty when you are dealing with people who are making a fortune out of exhibiting pornographic literature to the offensive reaction if i may use my noble friends own words of the large majority of people subjected to that exhibition is denigrating the word liberty <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might assist <e> <s> as always the noble lord lord nugent of guildford gave a very clear exposition of a point of view with regard to attempt but i would say to my noble friend lord houghton who i know will forgive me for addressing him again and this time with considerable affection as i always do an attempt of course could be made in these circumstances <e> <s> a constable is standing opposite a shop the display which is quite obviously an indecent one has

noble lord the minister would be an exception <e> <s> but exceptions can arise <e> <s> many of us who are very troubled by what is happening in places like soho at the moment would feel that a very severe deterrent in some major cases not the average ones is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble lord with great temerity because of the respect that we have for his agility and eloquence at his age <e> <s> but does he realise the seriousness of a speech such as his being reported <e> <s> does he realise what talking in terms of disloyalty and impossibility of integration

all want <e> <s> i expressed that view perfectly frankly even though it may be a view which other noble lords may disagree with <e> <s> when i answered the question which the noble lord addressed in his final speech it was to give an alternative that even if the government were right about ireland at this moment and about the effect that this bill would have it should be a temporary measure <e>

it cannot be right merely to rely upon the question of perversion of the course of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is unnecessary to detain the house by any comment save to say that one has noted with respect what the noble and learned lord has said and that one remembers the discussion that took place previously in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of clarification i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could explain to us the reason why it is thought unsuitable that a youngster under the age of when behaving in a manner which is contemptuous of the court should have an attendance centre order made against him but must have a fine <e> <s> one would have thought that the attendance centre order might have taught him some respect for the court whereas a fine is so often paid by a parent and may not have the same salutary effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is indebted to the noble and learned lord for

moved by the honourable member for grantham the argument against him was that in the case of someone who was nominated it was very wrong because of the time element to approve of this amendment by

lordships most likely know that the court of justice for example is made up of judges who come from the respective members of the eec each country being entitled as of right to have a judge who sits at the court <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether or not the noble and learned lord finds this a convenient moment to resume his seat if he is in fact concluding that part of the argument but surely so

discretion put into this bill <e>", "<cs> i was merely going to say that again judicial review would not give that wealth of experience because a judicial review would involve a judge and involve a different judge each time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the noble and learned lords permission may i thank him most heartily for the way in which he received this amendment here with the result that we now have this amendment from another place <e> <s> if i had been in my place in time i would have again expressed my gratitude to him with regard to a similar amendment dealing with the attachment of debts so perhaps he will allow me to say thank you twice <e>", "<cs> we are all indebted to the noble viscount and to the noble and learned lord for a very lucid debate so far on a vital matter <e> <s> i imagine that there will be no difference at all on any side of the committee <e> <s> once one accepts the fact that there is a need for an appeal certainly where the question of entitlement is concerned <e> <s> some of us feel that it should also be there in other circumstances where discretion applies but we are not going to debate that on this amendment <e> <s> i ask for the committees indulgence while i go further into this matter only because since there will be consideration between now and report stage i want if i may say so in all humility the government at least to know what is the position of my noble friends on this matter although i believe it is a position which will be held by the majority of the committee <e> <s> i would even be optimistic and say that it will be held by everybody in the committee <e>", "<cs> in another place after some debate the government conceded the general principle contained in subsection that is that so far as the secretary of state is concerned there should be no discrimination in regard to race religion or colour <e> <s> that was greeted with some satisfaction by those who are anxious to see harmonious race relations in this country and who had regard to the unfortunate feelings whether or not they are deserved that there is some sort of prejudicial element in this bill because that concession was at least an expression of parliament saying that in any circumstances before the secretary of state there must be no question of discrimination <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i was speaking to amendments aa and d because i understood that aa had been called <e>", "<cs> i find myself in order which is an unusual situation for me <e> <s> as your lordships will appreciate both these amendments deal with the question of appeal <e> <s> i am hoping as i believe many people on all sides of your lordships committee are hoping that the general question of appeal both on entitlement cases and discretionary cases will have the consideration of the government whatever the procedure for appeals <e> <s> it would be much more convenient and i believe that was in the mind of my noble friend lord pitt when he decided not to force the division that having heard an expression very definitely of the view of the committee certainly in many quarters the government would consider the whole question of appeals be it on discretionary cases or entitlement cases and would be courteous enough to inform those of us who have participated in a major way before the report stage as to what their conclusions are <e> <s> then it would be open to us either to voice gratitude to the government or to express our views in another way by putting appropriate amendments down at the report stage <e> <s> in that hope in the same way as my noble friend decided i do not propose to move these amendments or to weary the committee with any further speeches on the question of appeal <e>", "<cs> i am able to make a more objective speech than the noble viscount who has just spoken <e> <s> i cannot think if i may say so to your lordships of a speech more opportune before tomorrows happy event because i am quite sure that the noble viscount will be able to go home tonight knowing that his recorded speech in <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could take up a few moments of your lordships time to make a protest and a plea <e> <s> this is a definition clause and taking it for granted as we have to do that there are to be citizens of british dependent territories cannot we think of a better name for them other than a title that seems to betoken them as members of a british commonwealth of soup kitchens <e> <s> surely the term dependent is not necessary here <e> <s> can we not think of a term such as associated territories <e> <s> if that is caught by another act cannot the government think of a more suitable term than this <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will forgive an attire which has been enforced upon me <e> <s> i think that the house will agree with the sentiments of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in realising that the government if i may say so have graciously bowed to the will of this house <e> <s> it was the will of this house in regard to the brave people of gibraltar which was secured with the support of the opposition <e> <s> i put that on record merely in order that it will be abundantly clear as to those who fought gallantly for a very gallant lot of people in gibraltar and on this occasion it was not a question of political division but rather a matter of goodwill from all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house always has the greatest admiration for the speeches of the noble viscount who has just sat down not only because he has such a clear way of expressing his views but also if i may say this as a humble colleague of the way in which his expertise in the law is provided for the benefit of this house <e> <s> therefore i find myself in difficulty in saying in regard to the speech that he has just made that for this house with all its responsibility to be invited to object to the amendment of my noble and learned friend purely on the grounds presumably that the courts will not know which way to turn when it comes to the courts being asked to consider the provisions of this bill leaves me with the feeling that that is a view that will not find favour in this revising chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to continue a debate with the noble baroness <e> <s> i merely say that i thought she saw the light on the road to damascus last time i think that she may have been blinded on another road on this occasion <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it seemed to a committee of your lordships house of which i have the privilege to be a member that sometimes repeated eulogies to a maiden speaker bred a feeling of some insincerity by the time the eighth or ninth eulogy had been expressed <e> <s> nevertheless i should like from these benches to say how much we enjoyed the maiden speech of the noble lord lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> i especially enjoyed it because he referred as one knew he would to local government on which i

lordships house but never have i risen to address your lordships with more of a hope in my heart that action will result from the speeches following upon the unstarred question for which i think the house ought to be indebted to my noble friend lord longford <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would allow me to intervene and ask him just two questions <e> <s> first while one always welcomes u-turns from the government and sometimes does not receive them is it not a fact that the home secretary himself took the view that the partial suspension procedure when recommended elsewhere would not be efficient <e> <s> is that not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house is greatly indebted to the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack not only for the summary that he has just given of the history of the events leading to the presentation of this important and even to the initiated complex piece of legislation but also for the masterly patience and clarity with which he has explained its provisions <e> <s> if i may say so he has climbed his verbal mountain with his customary elegance and courage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord will forgive me when i say that i made it clear that there was a basic difference between the concept of domicile in taxation in british nationality law any other law and this law <e> <s> but i invited the noble and learned lord to consider whether the suggestion made by the solicitor-general in the last administration when this was being discussed that there should be some legislation to bring together the definitions or to set out the various definitions of domicile residence and ordinary residence would not simplify and clarify our law <e> <s> has the noble and learned lord considered that and if not will he do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble and learned lord agree that the whole question of prosecution and who should be the decider as to who should prosecute in criminal offences ought to have the attention of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said in many parts of the house after this very disquieting statement tribute ought to be paid to mr byford and his colleagues for the very frank and open way in which their report has been delivered <e> <s> it is a credit to the cleanliness of the administration of this country that such a report should appear <e> <s> but the main reason for disquiet does not appear yet to have been expressed <e> <s> if this were a report which followed upon an isolated murder and the inquiries made by the police i would have said that we could turn to the administration and say that an inquiry has been held into this one investigation which took place into this one crime and there appear to have been defects <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for allowing us to discuss this important matter today <e> <s> we have been grateful to him before <e> <s> we remember the debate he introduced on product liability which is covered by this report <e> <s> i shall never forget the closing words of his speech when he said that never would he be able to forget would never allow himself to forget the picture of those thalidomide children <e> <s> it is that pertinacity in regard to keeping all aspects of the pearson report alive that our admiration goes unstintingly to the noble lord today <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously nobody is interested in who should have the credit for an idea we

very hard on every word of his speech i missed one valuable sentence <e> <s> i am so glad that i have been put in receipt of this knowledge now and i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord got me completely right my lords and i am obliged to him for mentioning the point <e> <s> however does he realise into what area he is now drifting if every time somebody thought that conduct which was irresponsible or wrong had to go to the secretary of state before a decision could be reached <e> <s> are we not walking into the same multitude of disputes that we are trying to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would be kind enough to address himself to the abundant evidence which the pearson commission had that the present state of the law in regard to road accidents is unsatisfactory <e> <s> is it the governments conclusion that all that evidence should be ignored to the extent that the law is to remain the same <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think the noble viscount has raised a very real point of substance in this amendment <e> <s> i should like if i may to support him in his plea for it <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord will forgive me i hope if i say that from time immemorial at my very saintly and distinguished school the city of london the pronunciation was used that i begged liberty to use in this house <e>",

city of london solicitors company <e>", "<cs> i am sure the house is grateful to the noble and learned lord the point <e> <s> i am sure that in his generosity he will give the information not to just two of the noble lords who have spoken but all three <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the gracious way in which the noble and learned lord referred to this amendment and my own humble participation in it by something i said at second reading <e> <s> will i be forgiven if i express a plea that this is a matter of general application unless there be special circumstances namely that legislation

wonder whether the noble earl could help me on this <e> <s> those of us who are not accustomed to the scottish courts but who have obviously a great respect for them do not know what you can do by way

sufficient procedure to see that those applications can be made in the scottish courts and dealt with presumably after an investigation within a period of hours <e> <s> it is a matter which the english courts ought to follow with great diligence and i think we would look with great jealousy at that if we were told that this was an easy matter in the scottish courts <e>", "<cs> my lords a short bill merits a short speech especially from someone who through an oversight has not got his name on the list of speakers <e> <s> but it was my intention to speak on this second reading and to pay my tribute as so many tributes have been paid to the noble lord lord houghton who ought to be known as the st francis of assisi of parliament <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to rise at this moment but i am

has pointed out that there is another act under which one can demolish where there is danger <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recollect as many of us do the assurance that was given on behalf of the government at the time of the discussion of the nationality bill that the utmost humanity and reasonableness would be shown in dealing with applications for immigration and naturalisation <e>

decision on their application is made <e> <s> does he further and lastly i assure the noble lord know that the delays which are occurring in the home office department in regard to naturalisation and immigration are absolutely unconscionable at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the obvious feeling that exists will the noble lord undertake that his noble friend the minister will be made very much aware of the discussion here today <e> <s> is there the possibility too of looking very speedily into administration in order to find out whether these matters cannot be speeded up <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that if one estimates the cost of administering the refund and the cost of computing the interest and dealing with correspondence with ratepayers the cost will be such that another supplementary rate demand may well be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has the gift of taking hold of a subject which in other hands would lead to a dull exposition and infusing into it a delightfully controversial shaft of light so that it becomes a sparkling subject of discussion and he has done that this afternoon <e> <s> indeed we are indebted to him for introducing this debate on the general subject of rate reform and for directing our attention to the government green paper issued as recently as th december and referred to in the statement made on that day by the secretary of state for the environment in another place and repeated in your lordships house in the rather more cajoling terms of the minister the noble lord lord bellwin <e>",

look at the precise wording of the manifesto he will find that it is not as he said <e> <s> it was in fact said that the abolition of the domestic rate would have to give way to a reduction in taxes

knowledge of greek mythology the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor commenced a most interesting and as usual lucid speech by presenting the house with a fearful picture of being torn to pieces by some dogs <e> <s> i was trying to envisage what kind of noble lord would ever succeed in tearing the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to pieces and i certainly do not want to envisage myself in that capacity <e> <s> incidentally borrowing if i may from the study i have made of the noble and learned lords illustrious career i found it most strange that he should refer to a lady who was bathing in modesty <e> <s> i seem to remember an episode to which i shall not refer your lordships at any length in which if i may say so the noble and learned lord when bathing was announcing his presence with the sound of bells <e> <s> but as i have said i do not want to take on the task of baying at the heels of the noble and learned lord or certainly not of biting at his presence <e> <s> i want to appear in another canine capacity and merely stand on my hind legs and beg for some more morsels of help in regard to legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords when one adds the able advocacy of a leading member of the bar to the natural persuasiveness of a welshman one has indeed a formidable proponent of any cause <e> <s> i am sure that the house will admire as i certainly did the very lucid way in which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran moved the second reading of this bill <e> <s> it is not the first time that the noble lord has used his advocacy in a similar cause

noble lord as always will courteously give way when he mentions the name of one of your lordships house and criticises what he says <e> <s> nothing that i said was ever meant to cast an aspersion upon the ability of her majestys judges to judge what was appropriate before them <e> <s> my point was that this was not an appropriate matter for such a judge to judge <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord may quarrel with me but to rob me of my noble status is really too much <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord moved the amendment in his customary humorous but nevertheless lucid manner <e> <s> i am tempted to rise only with the possible excuse in advance that i hope the house will not regard me as childish but i am somewhat encouraged to make the point i do by the noble and learned lord having said that he would not normally use the term the organ of a company <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble and learned lord spoke a new article a is proposed and i

to express my gratitude i am sure that i am doing so on behalf of all those concerned with the matter to the noble and learned lord for the consideration that he has given to the points made in the speeches in committee <e> <s> there was not only my own speech as he implied but i remember the support that was given to various points by the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce and the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury <e> <s> believe that the noble and learned lord lord diplock also indicated his support for the points that were then raised <e> <s> i should also like to express my own gratitude and that of the city of london solicitors company for the way in which the noble and learned lords department very graciously dealt with points that were raised on the suggested amendment which has now taken the form before your lordships and which so far as i know is completely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house would want to agree this amendment <e> <s> i apologise that i too had omitted to see it <e> <s> this of course is an order which is made to a payer of maintenance which he might not in fact observe and there was no penalty imposed if he did not observe it and obviously this puts the matter right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord was kind enough to refer to some remarks that were made on the previous occasion when the report stage was taken <e> <s> i imagine that he was referring to certain terminology which your lordships will see before you in the amendments now being moved nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am at least relieved that the words or the decisions of their organs will be removed from the bill <e> <s> that at least is some improvement but i am still hoping in spite of the as usual courteous communication i have received from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that some consideration can be given to the wording of this clause <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said last time that the schoolboys i referred to were hardly likely to read this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships would like to add to that list and those gracious words of thanks thanks to the noble and learned lords the lord chancellor and the lord advocate for the way in which they have dealt with quite a complex measure and especially with the way in which the question of state immunity was dealt with after an interesting discussion in which certain noble and learned lords on the cross-benches participated with such weight <e>", "<cs> my lords this house is a very tolerant place <e> <s> there is a bill before us at the moment which deals with a couple of acts of parliament and certain narrow sections namely section of the transport act which allowed the shire counties to make provision for the elderly and the disabled and section of the transport london act which extended that power to the councils of london boroughs and the city corporation <e> <s> the greater london council as we have been reminded used its p rate provision to deal with these matters before has decided that it has many duties to perform which may well have to be performed out of that p rate and that in any event certain legal advice it has received makes it doubtful as to whether the p rate user would be proper having regard to the house of lords decision <e> <s> so this bill we are told comes before us as it came before <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister could rise above such a perspective <e> <s> instead of quoting remarks which may be in the right context or in the wrong context i hope that the minister and i am asking him a question will consider the advisability of introducing into his speech words of conciliation and arrangements for joint planning because as i repeat the citizens of london are fed up with the politics of this and they want a decent transport system <e>", "<cs> my lords the house would have been entranced by even the metaphorical picture of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor darning old socks in presenting us with certain legislation <e> <s> may i be permitted to congratulate him on the neat colourful and even artistic tenor of his presentation of his sewing ability <e> <s> may i also commiserate with him on having to deal not only with old socks but also with odd socks in this conglomerate bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes what everyone will agree has been a frank and delightful speech may i ask whether in his nostalgic recollection he would include the fact that the old london county council on the basis of employing half a floor at county hall used to administer the hospitals of london <e>", "<cs> in view of that intervention which was obviously most proper may i disclose that i am in the dual capacity of walking into one formula happily not the disabled and also very proudly of having been a ratepayer of london for very many years <e> <s> having disclosed that interest may i speak in support of the amendment and deal with the arguments which as always have been lucidly expressed by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i say lucidly <e> <s> i did not say logically <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will forgive me if i differentiate between the two <e>", "<cs> for the sake of the time of the committee i wish that things could be left in the way in which the minister would like to leave them <e> <s> i think your lordships will remember that the travel arrangements made by the greater london council be they right or wrong were forecast openly in their manifesto be it sensible or ridiculous and were never greeted throughout the kingdom by lawyers or others with the remark how foolish <e> <s> you will not be able to do it <e> <s> it is contrary to the law <e> <s> nobody thought of that <e> <s> no conservative lawyer unless he was deceitfully hiding his reasoning and arguments until after the election was over and i do not think that is applicable to any conservative lawyer

procedure to which i am unaccustomed and to which i hope to be unaccustomed in the future <e> <s> however if my noble friends phraseology were used if i may be allowed to add to the arguments of the noble lord the minister i think that the local authoritys decision could be challenged on the ground that the wording of the act reads that it is inappropriate to have a sex establishment in the area <e> <s> to have that finding by a responsible local authority acting in a quasi-judicial capacity may well necessitate the hearing of evidence the hearing of the local residents and so on as to whether it is considered to be appropriate or inappropriate <e> <s> i should have thought that that is the last thing that the local authority would want to have by way of a responsibility <e> <s> the simple wording of the bill which i think achieves the object is that the local authority has the right to say nil in our area and <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister care to reflect between committee stage and report stage upon his previous pronouncement which disappointed some of us and encouraged others namely that it would be rather difficult for local authorities to declare nil for the number of sex shops within its area because of the dangers of a judicial review <e> <s> a judicial review normally takes place when an authority has exercised its judgment without having gone <e> <s> through a judicial process which it is deemed it ought to have gone through if one looks at a statute <e> <s> in those circumstances those of us who would like to see that the authority was not dragged through a judicial review would like to see words such as nil may in the absolute discretion of the authority be an appropriate number for the purposes of sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee would not wish to be detained by any argument where the noble lord the minister is courteous enough to say that he with his advisers will consider it <e> <s> i did not suggest that words should be put in which exclude a judicial review but words that would make it more difficult for a judicial review to succeed against the local authority <e> <s> i said and these are common words in statutes that a local authority shall be shown to have an absolute discretion and therefore it would be only where that absolute discretion is exercised fraudulently or grossly wrongly that the judicial review would succeed against the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister accept that some of us in whatever part of this house we may sit regard an attack upon the independence of the judiciary as being an attack on democracy itself <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord in the wake of those very helpful remarks could go one stage further <e> <s> everyone would agree it is right and proper that the facilities should be available <e> <s> the noble and learned lord feels that it is the presentation of a mailed fist if one makes it obligatory <e> <s> i know he will pardon me if with respect i say that i think it would merely be an efficacious glove and not a mailed fist because obviously it would not affect in the slightest those courts which are making the facilities available they would regard it as being merely a repetition of what they are normally doing <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting and obviously very constructive discussion on a very important matter <e> <s> indeed i believe that this would be the only national welfare benefit and it is a very important welfare benefit where no right of appeal lies <e> <s> having heard the very clear words of the noble and learned lord i understand them as meaning that he does agree certainly in principle that some appellate procedure is necessary that he feels that the crown court procedure is not appropriate and that he is going to give active consideration to bringing back at a later stage of the bill an appellate procedure but not necessarily one involving the crown court <e> <s> if that is what the noble and learned lord meant then we on these benches are more than happy <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord and willingly withdraw in view of those words <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government care to take a leaf from the metropolitan police and print the percentage of coloured people among the serving nursing profession <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may refer to the noble lord

be allowed to read the time-honoured words which occur in this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down i wonder whether he would permit this committee to abandon this matter with some reassurance and some quietude of mind <e> <s> i think all of us will accept what he has just said <e> <s> it must be his decision <e> <s> personally i understand it but questions of interpretation are not for her majestys government here they are for her majestys government in canada and for the courts in canada <e> <s> we accept that because he has just said it and we have to accept it <e> <s> i personally would have accepted it even without his saying it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues i wonder whether he will allow a protest to be made at that <e>

act and made the offence one which was offensive to reasonable people <e> <s> i must say that to use that definition creates in my mind and i can only give an individual opinion the feeling that not just the percentages to which the noble lord referred would fail to get past those who were saying whether it was likely to lead to conviction i would have thought the percentages would be increased

decision she has done so with a very good heart <e> <s> but there are some cases which practitioners have come across in many courts where the good heart has been absent and where many a needy person

that we may have some boundaries to register in future so that the law in the language of this motion will be both modernised and clarified <e>", "<cs> my lords met with those very courteous words i almost wish that i was not intervening because i may be showing my ignorance instead of the knowledge which i am supposed to have <e> <s> the point i was making and which i believe other speakers were making on this matter was not that there should be an inflexible definition but that categories bringing the matter up to date should be clearly stated in simple language in an act of parliament with the same flexibility as the four categories are now supposed to have and with all the wealth of legal precedents upon which future decisions could be made <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister who has given a clear explanation of the reasons for his objections to this amendment will kindly enlighten the committee on his reference to case law and i believe that he mentioned section of the principal act <e> <s> would he enlighten the house by telling them what in his view after studying the case law a direct interest in a dispute means in relation to this bill <e> <s> i

of there being a dispute and sickness arising in the course of it rather than having a section of the workforce possibly in dire pecuniary need put in the position of having to prove that unlike their brother workers they did not participate in the dispute and they regarded themselves as having no direct interest in it <e>", "<cs> i have a shrewd suspicion that the noble lord the minister with his usual courtesy in telling me he will write me a long letter was very charmingly evading the issue and not giving your lordships the guidance to which you are entitled <e> <s> i did not ask for a long

the premises by virtue of the fact that a film is being shown and these considerations are not always taken into account by licensing justices who would not know of the occasional use for film purposes <e> <s> i do not want to take the discussion any further <e> <s> i only wanted to clarify my mind in repeating my point so that at least the noble lord the minister would know what i was trying to suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i in turn apologise to the noble lord lord inglewood if i have interrupted any speech he was about to make <e> <s> i do not think that in your lordships house i have ever appreciated more than tonight the fact that i was trained as a laywer <e> <s> i say that only because so often i have found in the course of my career that if i listened only to counsel for the prosecution i would find myself coming to a wrong verdict <e> <s> by the grace of god in the justice of this country which has set an example to and taught the world a lesson in the principles of justice there is a principle of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite follow the relevance of that remark but no doubt the noble lord will explain it to me at some other time <e>", "<cs> there may in fact be an argument a philosophical argument a practical argument a statistical argument in regard to the short sharp shock in the detention centre <e> <s> but the one thing that so far as i am aware the noble lord the minister has not dealt with is the very real advantage that will be apparent to the whole committee and which was mentioned by my noble friend lord elystan-morgan that is the greater flexibility <e> <s> about one thing there is no doubt at all that is that overcrowding of our institutions is an absolute disgrace <e> <s> that applies in respect of the youngster as much as everybody else <e> <s> there is also the point that greater flexibility obviously would allow of non-overcrowding if i may put it that way because of the variety of institutions that are available if there is a single youth sentence <e>", "<cs> i think it would be i am so sorry <e>", "<cs> it is quite obvious from the number of noble lords who have contributed to this debate and indeed the time we have taken on this amendment that we have hit upon a very vital subject indeed <e> <s> i think it would be quite wrong at this time and with the size of the committee as it is at present to take the matter further at this stage <e> <s> i therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment and will come back to it if i may or may be someone else will be coming back to it at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> the committee will be grateful that the amendments in another place and in your lordships house have produced some practical results <e> <s> i repeat our gratitude to the minister and in the circumstances beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i know that she wants to assist the committee she always does <e> <s> i believe that she will find that she is speaking to the next amendment and not to this one <e> <s> this amendment does not deal with the question of representation <e>", "<cs> may i say that my noble friends and i find the ministers answer although as always courteous extremely unsatisfying and i want to give the following reasons <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull gave some very good and cogent summarised reasons for this amendment <e> <s> she talked about uniformity and hinted in the most tactful language at the miscarriages of justice that very often have occurred in various areas concerning this very serious matter of the care order <e> <s> if instead of criticising as it was quite open to him to do the language of the grounds and the matters which one though the court ought to consider the noble lord the minister had said that the government would like to use alternative language that would have been a very helpful intervention <e> <s> indeed if the noble lord had gone as far as his right honourable friend in another place when this very matter was being discussed and had said that he appreciated the importance of considerations like these being known to the court and had added that since that date the government had considered guidelines and would be giving them to all courts which would be concerned with the making of care orders the committee would have been more satisfied <e>", "<cs> it possibly was with warm-hearted anticipation that i looked at the noble and learned lord and hoped that he would help us as he usually does with his guidance and with his sense of justice which is so pronounced <e> <s> but i have no doubt it is only because he wishes to consider all the remarks made today and weigh them carefully as he always does that he has not risen <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is always courteous and i am most grateful to him for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> the point that i was trying to make was that a child of the kind that we are thinking of when asked or even if the parent is asked do you wish to apply for legal aid <e> <s> will really not be in a position in many many cases to answer in his own interests <e> <s> i was therefore putting the point that it is the aggressive child or the aggressive parent who will say yes <e> <s> if on the other hand it is mandatory that question will not arise <e>", "<cs> i can paraphrase the clause by saying that it enables courts to require a local authority to remove from home for up to six months any young person convicted or found guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment in the case of a person over who commits that offence while already subject to a care order <e> <s> if i were the only person pleading on behalf of my noble friends for removal of the clause from the bill your lordships might not have been considerably affected so i hope the committee will forgive me if i read the list of those so much concerned with all aspects of juvenile offenders that they regard clause as objectionable <e>", "<cs> not quite as heartless if i may say so as going against the whole experience as recorded and as i ventured to summarise before the committee of all those who have to do with residential homes the ameliorating effect that those homes can have the order discipline and fairness within them a point which i noticed the noble lord the minister while covering most of the rest of the debate ignored <e> <s> his one justification was that the magistrates would like to have this power and that one was saving the child from dare i say it <e> <s> drifting between the scylla <e>", "<cs> the quickness of mind of the noble lord the minister is something that many of us have noticed and admired before <e> <s> if he wishes me to carry on with a naval metaphor then i shall do so and say that sometimes it is very sensible having sailed a straight course between scylla and charybdis if you want to make another journey between them to adopt the same straight course <e> <s> it may well be that the magistrates will decide after a reprimand to send the child back under the self-same care order but give the magistrates the opportunity under this section contrary to the advice of probation officers and everyone else and they will not <e> <s> they will avail themselves of this power thinking that parliament decided that it wanted the magistrates to do so <e> <s> what they will do is to take the child away from the parents or from wherever it may be and put it in one of the residential establishments which those who run them and the magistrates do not do not want <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the intention of the noble and learned lord that this discussion should be brief on such technical matters will commend itself to the house and if i say that your lordships will understand that it is not my intention to elongate the proceedings at all <e> <s> only because there were two short matters of principle in regard to the amendment which the noble and learned lord was so clearly expounding do i venture to make two comments <e> <s> first in the committee proceedings in another place and i am referring to col of the proceedings of standing committee b on th april the right honourable and learned gentleman the solicitor-general said this <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will remember the gratitude that was expressed for the provision in the bill that related to interim relief and your lordships or some of your lordships may remember the very learned but nevertheless practical discussion that took place on that occasion <e> <s> this is obviously to improve and complete the whole of the situation relating to such interim relief and may i for my part humbly express my gratitude for the present way in which this clause is drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble and learned lord loves every part of the united kingdom and quite incidentally he happened to leave out wales when he mentioned england and northern ireland <e> <s> i am sure that he would love to rectify that omission <e>", "<cs> if it will assist the noble and learned lord and the house may i say that his explanations are always so clear when there are amendments in a grouping if he would like to take them and if it is in order for him to do so as an entity instead of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will well know that this clause now as amended is of great help to practitioners who were in some doubt as to the position and certainly as to what they were committing their clients to when there was a contest in regard to jurisdiction <e> <s> it will be of great interest to the legal profession to have heard what the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on both his points first of all in regard to the common sense of moving these amendments together but really more seriously in regard to helpfulness of the sidenotes to which he referred <e> <s> these will be very useful to practitioners <e> <s> i am personally most grateful and i am sure that most practitioners are that there will be this reference to the convention which will make it rather snore easy to deal with the various clauses of the bill in relation to the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> maybe i can helpfully commence all the speeches that i have to make and i shall try to be as brief as possible by saying that following upon the second reading and with the great assistance of the lord chancellors department there are amendments before your lordships which will put this bill to which your lordships were good enough to give a second reading in a tidy concise and clear form <e> <s> it is against that background that i move the first amendment which is before your lordships <e> <s> this new clause and the two which follow it are designed to replace clauses and of the bill <e> <s> this first new clause simply describes the rule of common law with which the bill is concerned namely the rule which precludes a person from acquiring any benefit from an unlawful killing for which he is responsible <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that correction <e> <s> may i so do <e>", "<cs> there is no question of the noble baroness lady phillips being in any way a lone voice <e> <s> i do not blame her in the slightest but if she had waited for clause of the bill she would have seen that murder not only is excluded at the request of another place but also is excluded by this bill <e>", "<cs> as always i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his intervention <e>", "<cs> i would be grateful if the question could be put again <e>", "<cs> the intention is not only there but it has been put there more clearly by the new clause <e> <s> that is the purpose of the new clause to which i will come in a moment if your lordships agree that clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i only wanted to make sure it had been left out <e> <s> with regard to this new clause since the law of northern ireland and if i may i will speak to amendment no <e> <s> as well in order to shorten the committees proceedings is broadly similar to that of england and wales as regard the forfeiture rule and its operation this new clause which goes with amendment no <e> <s> enables corresponding provision to be made for northern ireland but by order in council subject to negative rather than affirmative resolution in parliament <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i was hoping for the assistance upon this matter of a very noble and a very learned lord but i see that i am not to have it because he is still observing his benevolent neutrality <e> <s> i should like again to thank him not for the neutrality but for the benevolence which has made his officials be of such help to me <e> <s> if your lordships have had any learning at all this afternoon would you kindly attribute the learning to the officials of the lord chancellors department and not to me <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lords from whom as usual i have learnt <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that in difficult international situations such as exist at this moment in the middle east one-sided questions and one-sided debates in this house do not enhance the role of the united kingdom but depreciate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords on the motion that the bill do now pass which your lordships have so happily agreed to it falls to my lot to express some appreciation and i do it very happily <e> <s> my first words of appreciation go to the secretary of state who himself and with his department both here and in another place have assisted those who have promoted this bill in draftsmanship and in very sound advice <e> <s> i thank the national consumer council who have been at my disposal on all occasions when i needed them <e> <s> i know that this was also true of my right honourable friend in another place when he sponsored this bill there <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may at all times have such a helpful and courteous intervention in the middle of any speech i make i shall be so grateful as indeed i am on this occasion <e> <s> i was about to say that i do not think that it is necessary for me to repeat myself <e> <s> all i would do and i promise it in very summarised form is to say that there is contemporary proof of the great need for consumer protection by this legislation in two publications which have recently been issued <e> <s> the first one was on home improvements <e> <s> it was a discussion paper published in march of this year by the office of fair trading <e> <s> that highlights various problems of poor performance delay and high cost in the home improvement market <e> <s> secondly in <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene to try to help <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that the house is unanimous in its view as the noble viscount has said that it wants this private members bill to go on the statute book as soon as possible <e> <s> as the noble viscount has said it deals with something that befouls and i do not in any way shrink from that word many of our streets especially in the metropolis and many areas other than the metropolis cinema clubs which have to repeat a phrase which has been used already driven a coach and horses through existing legislation <e>

either <e>", "<cs> i can deal with these amendments in one sentence they are very sensible <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for what he has said and i look forward with great interest to seeing moved by the government an amendment along these lines so that we can consider it at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have tried hard to follow the ministers logic <e> <s> i am usually able to do so even if i find myself disagreeing with his principles <e> <s> i do not find his logic on this occasion as strong as it usually is <e> <s> if the government were saying that nbc would retain a per cent <e> <s> controlling interest in national express coach services if they were willing to say we give that undertaking to the committee and the noble lord lord teviot i could follow that <e> <s> i would then understand that the public is being asked i am using the ministers words to shoulder the responsibility of finance instead of it being left purely to the government and that as a result of that financial <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord the minister and i am most grateful to him for allowing me to do so <e> <s> in a matter so important as this will he please not leave hanging in the air vague terms such as significant <e> <s> what does he mean by significant <e> <s> is it significant from the point of view of control or of voting power or is it significant for some other reason <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is quite entitled to put forward an argument that control should go into private hands and out of nbc <e> <s> it is a perfectly proper and clear argument to put politically <e> <s> you either hold that view or you do not <e> <s> there is no point in wasting a lot of time in committee stage debating that issue <e> <s> i do not propose to weary your lordships by conducting any such argument <e> <s> there is however another argument which says that it may well be that control ought to go out and therefore the committee ought not to agree with an amendment which proposes that per cent <e> <s> be retained by nbc in the case of any of its subsidiaries <e> <s> but on both sides of the committee indeed in all parts of the committee although i look at the cross-benches and find i am looking merely at benches so that perhaps i should limit myself to speaking of both sides of the committee the view is that control ought to be in private hands but there ought to be residual rights always vested in nbc in order that certain situations can be controlled <e> <s> if your lordships had heard from the noble lord the minister a rather more cogent definition of significant this would not have required him to be a lexicographer at all but would merely require him and i say this with affection to be a frank politician and that is all and that is all that we ask for <e>", "<cs> i have been asked a question with the customary courtesy of the noble lord lord lloyd and therefore i ought to answer it <e> <s> it is not unknown in commercial circles and the noble lord has mixed in them with great advantage to those commercial circles for a company to be acquired in order to stifle competition <e> <s> i give but one example <e> <s> it is not unknown that shareholders come into a company dealing with transport in the hope of making very large gains and as a result of it possibly putting prices up in a way which is not suitable for a company in which the nation holds shares <e> <s> it could very well be that shareholders have the desire when getting into a company and i mention this example to see that its assets are sold because a quick profit could be made as a result although that is not in the national interest <e> <s> i do not think that i need go any further with examples but i could do so <e>", "<cs> i hope i heard the noble lord the minister aright when he guided the committee along the lines that if you sell all the assets of an undertaking of necessity you sell the shares and in such an event will have to obtain the permission of the secretary of state <e> <s> i did not think i could have heard him aright although the noble lord the minister nods his head in assent which means that i ought now to believe that i did hear him aright <e> <s> and having believed that i did hear him aright i find myself unable to believe the advice he has received <e> <s> it is quite possible to sell the goodwill of a business as part of the undertaking <e> <s> it is quite possible to sell the assets of a business without selling any shares at all indeed the average alternative facing a commercial enterprise which is for disposal <e>", "<cs> i do not think the committee will be very patient with me if i continue this argument for much longer <e> <s> of course it is possible to sell an undertaking or all the assets without selling shares <e> <s> what i am saying is that if one does do that it comes within paragraph <e>", "<cs> impossible <e>", "<cs> again with the committees permission i shall try to put the issue before the committee as i see it especially if i may say so with the help of the intervention of the noble lord lord teviot and the introduction of this amendment by my noble friend lord underhill <e> <s> under clause of this bill the secretary of state can give directions to the national bus company requiring it to use its powers under the section we are now considering <e> <s> secretaries of state are very powerful people but there is an even more powerful instrument within our government and that is the treasury <e>", "<cs> i apologise for raising very briefly a technical point on which i may very well be wrong but i do not want the clause to be passed by the committee without its being drawn to the attention of the committee or of the minister to whom i have given short notice of the point <e> <s> i see that the next amendment seeks to insert bus before company in clause <e> <s> i have noticed that in this clause and i am looking at line on page we again get the company and indeed we get it again in clause at line <e> <s> i see no reference and here i apologise to the committee if i have omitted to see something to anything in the bill which defines the company as against the bus company <e> <s> i hope that i am not raising a false point <e>", "<cs> only out of sheer amusement do i refer the committee and the minister to clause where the amendment is due to take place <e> <s> the noble lord will see that the bus company is mentioned in that clause even through it starts off with a reference to the bus company <e> <s> in other words we do not get the company <e> <s> the explanation is at least not consistent but i would not dream of spending any more time on it <e>", "<cs> i should like to echo in this chamber every word of the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye <e> <s> it is worse than the noble lord thinks <e> <s> i stand to be corrected but as i understand it not even the negative procedure is provided for under this bill <e> <s> this is a case not of the new amalgam as was mentioned a moment ago by the noble lord but a question of the new despotism <e>", "<cs> i am saying to the committee that not even the negative procedure is provided for under this bill <e> <s> in other words complete power is given to the secretary of state not to come anywhere near parliament in the following circumstances to which i shall briefly allude <e>", "<cs> we should vote for the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister will forgive me <e> <s> it may be that i have made a wrong intervention and i apologise if i have done but he is the last person who would want to mislead the committee <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that under the oil and gas bill there was not the necessity to have a statutory instrument even by the negative procedure <e> <s> i say it because i was arguing the case for the affirmative procedure <e> <s> it may be that i am wrong but my recollection is that there was a negative procedure that was required <e> <s> therefore the noble lord the minister is unintentionally misleading the committee <e>", "<cs> i must return to the fray if only for one minute <e> <s> the noble lord the minister and i am not going back on the point about the oil and gas bill or any other precedent is asking the committee to consider this issue if there is a quarrel because it could not be anything else or a dispute between the national bus company and the secretary of state as to whether it is for the public good the wider public interest which the minister mentioned as to whether assets should be sold or shares should be sold the secretary of state decides and not parliament and not even a reference by the negative procedure i say to the committee is to be allowed <e> <s> i know of no precedent for that <e> <s> if there is such a precedent i say that it is a bad one and we ought to start setting the precedent the other way round <e>", "<cs> naturally one listens with the greatest patience and appreciation when the noble lord lord byers with his great experience talks about a matter of this kind <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will realise that i have that respect when i make the following observations if one were facing a situation where one was taking a firm indulging in private enterprise merging with or being taken over by another firm the arguments about negotiations about the fairness of the position where there are those who can negotiate on behalf of the employees with the employers is a very sensible argument to make <e> <s> the question of being able to afford these arrangements is also a very sensible argument to put forward <e>", "<cs> i was not talking about the result <e> <s> i was talking about the poor employee who usually goes into nationalised industry or a public appointment and feels that he is going into something secure <e> <s> the fact that economic conditions belie all his hopes and dreams is a matter to be deplored but not used as an argument <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for giving way <e> <s> i should like at once frankly to confess that though i looked for it i had not seen in the clause the definition of controlling interest <e> <s> i readily concede that it is contained in subsection <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not being a pest to the committee but will the noble lord at the same time as he is courteously looking into that also look into the question of why it has to be a company with a controlling interest by the government <e> <s> one would have thought that if it were an interim company it would be a company that was owned by the government <e> <s> i cannot quite see who would be the other shareholder <e> <s> but as i have said i am not going to detain the committee on that if he would be kind enough to look into that issue as well <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord the minister i wonder whether this has been thought through properly and fairly <e> <s> the original provision as unamended by this proposed amendment said and i understood it perfectly well that if a site consisted purely and simply of a testing station and it was the subject matter of a lease then at the end of that term there should be no security of tenure <e> <s> i understood subsection quite well and it seemed sensible <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble earl the minister to be kind enough to let me intervene in order to clarify at least my mind <e> <s> i thought there was always a duty when any offence is committed to produce the licence either to the police officer who took up the question of the offence or if it was not then available to the police station <e> <s> the noble earl said that there was no need for it to be produced to the officer and that if the citizen concerned who is alleged to have committed an offence did not want to do so he need not produce the licence at the police station <e> <s> i do not understand <e>", "<cs> if i am looking solemn at the moment it is only because i have heard a score and it does not fill me with excitement <e> <s> that is the only reason why i am looking solemn

with his usual courtesy to answer me <e> <s> if i am to blame and i repeat this for not making myself clear then i apologise both to him and to the committee <e> <s> i had hoped that this was the question that i had asked <e> <s> the minister has said that fixed penalty notices can be issued in respect of endorsable offences <e> <s> that is principle no <e> <s> <e> <s> principle no <e> <s> is

following problem <e> <s> if i say no to the fixed penalty offence i invite a prosecution a summons and on receipt of that summons if i turn up in court and a magistrate does not find in my favour i have for the first time in my life an endorsement on my licence <e> <s> that is a very serious matter for example to someone who is earning his livelihood as a driver <e> <s> on the other hand if i surrender to the blandishments of the officer in spite of the fact that i think the allegation is unjust i then accept the fixed penalty notice <e> <s> i think that that is an injustice if of course and only if i am told that if i take the fixed penalty notice i do not get an endorsement <e> <s> i ask the minister to say that <e> <s> if i do get an endorsement i ask him to tell me from an administrative point of view who makes the endorsement <e> <s> i have taken my licence back the officer does not have it <e> <s> is he supposed on the road to write in an endorsement <e> <s> that is

about parking summonses or notices <e> <s> we have always had that we have it now <e> <s> i am talking about the new procedures <e>", "<cs> before that amendment is withdrawn may i say that i have had another look at the bill and i know the committee will pardon me and not think that i keep on intruding upon the discussions because we have to get one thing absolutely clear <e> <s> the noble earl the minister gave me the information that he had received from those who are briefing him <e> <s> i know he would always want to explain things most clearly to the committee but i now find on looking at the bill that the answer he gave is not truly accurate <e>", "<cs> but not on the question of points i point out to the noble earl <e> <s> forgive me for being such a pest and i say that openly to the committee but i must get this clear in justice to myself and other members of the committee who are not clear <e> <s> i am on the point of a discretionary endorsement <e> <s> if i go to the court thinking that i am innocent of the alleged offence i find that i have a risk in regard to certain offences of the court endorsing my licence and exercising their discretion in that regard <e> <s> if i give in to the policeman on the fixed penalty notice in regard to a discretionary endorsement offence i presumably get no endorsement at all because there is nobody who can exercise the discretion <e>", "<cs> the bill says if i may say this to the noble earl obligatory endorsement <e> <s> therefore the answer that he has given i know by being briefed and therefore it is not his fault is that you cannot have a fixed penalty notice if there is a discretionary endorsement <e> <s> but the bill does not say that <e> <s> it only says it in the case of an obligatory endorsement <e>", "<cs> the committee will realise the breadth of mind that exists on the benches behind me as well as the fact that this is a completely non-political matter when i rise in order to say that i personally agree with every word that the minister has said and although as he very well knows i have the greatest of respect and indeed affection for my noble friend lord underhill i do not myself think that this is a just or proper amendment for the very reasons that the minister gave <e>", "<cs> i rise for only a moment i promise the committee <e> <s> i would not mind if this did relieve the pressure on the courts and one knows how severe that pressure is in regard to some serious criminal <e>", "<cs> on that point again with persistence and i hope the committee will not think it worse than that before moving from committee stage on this bill and so that we know where we stand in our consideration between committee stage and report i ask again whether i am correct or not that someone will face an endorsement on a discretionary basis if he goes to court and there will be no provision for an endorsement on a discretionary basis if the penalty notice is accepted <e> <s> if the minister will be kind enough to answer that we shall know where we stand <e>", "<cs> my lords there appears a seemly unanimity in the house at this moment <e> <s> i have not risen to break that spirit but to add my voice on behalf of my noble friends and myself in saying that this is a very sensible amendment <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble viscount and if i may say so add my thanks to the minister whose officials also have helped in the intervening period to see that acceptable wording is now in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i want only to add one more word and that is that i hope this bill in view of the motion now before the house will go to another place will be considered very speedily and will very soon pass into law <e> <s> the capital city possibly needs this legislation more

argument to its logical conclusion because it might lend weight to what the minister was saying about the legal arguments which might be pursued in the event of an amendment of this kind being made <e> <s> i should prefer to say that if a case were taken to court and the magistrates found the motorist guilty i would hope that the advocate or the motorist himself or the representative of the aa

should if they agreed with the submission have in mind mitigating the penalty <e>", "<cs> i rise on a point of order and i stand to be corrected <e> <s> as i understood it the question was put as to whether with the leave of the committee the amendment should be withdrawn <e> <s> there may have been one dissentient voice that was heard <e> <s> in the circumstances am i not right in asking whether the question of whether or not the leave of the committee should be granted is the question to be put <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that i am on a correct point and since i was not on a correct point last time it seems that i am setting a course of conduct <e> <s> will the noble earl please explain in a little more particular why the words unless the contrary is proved should be omitted <e> <s> because i did not quite follow his explanation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i was thinking in terms of something being mislaid in the post giving rise to an unfair question for the driver <e> <s> but clearly it would be open to him to state that point to the court <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give the noble earl one query now <e> <s> as usual some extremely courteous assistance has just been given me when i raised the question and i am obliged for that <e> <s> it is still not quite clear that the committee should know in regard to these amendments and their practical application that it is an offence for a driver to give wrong information to a police officer at the time when the particulars are being taken and the penalty notice issued <e> <s> if a wrong address were given obviously that would amount to a negation of these procedures where the matter of non-payment must go to the court in the area where the driver is supposed to be residing <e> <s> as a result of that if it were not laid down that it is an offence under the bill to give the wrong information there would be no sanction at all <e>", "<cs> i have been asked by my noble friend lord underhill to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his patient and very clear explanation which we will obviously be studying with great care <e> <s> it has elucidated a lot of problems that we had and it seems that many of them if not all have been ironed out <e> <s> it seems to me that we are using this discussion rather usefully to cover the whole procedure of the fixed penalty notice whether in the midst of the fogs that beset the highlands or lowlands of scotland or whether south of the border <e> <s> therefore i do not ask for the forgiveness of the committee if i try to finish off some of the problems regarding the form of the fixed penalty notice as well as some of the problems we discussed last time in the absence of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> that means we can deal with these questions now so that we need not waste time later <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord and i am especially grateful to him for recognising the difficulty and the possible injustice that might be involved <e> <s> i am delighted to accept the suggestion that this might be considered by the government between now and report stage <e> <s> i would ask only that those who are particularly interested in my point should receive in good time a copy of any letter which is being issued in regard to this matter so that we can consider whether it would be helpful or otherwise to put down an amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> purely as a matter of interest if the noble earl will look at the clause and the line we are dealing with the words used are notice or notification <e> <s> we are now putting in a certificate <e> <s> simply for clarity of language what is the difference between a notice and a notification <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i have mentioned one of the most important points in the whole of the bill <e> <s> i am perfectly content to have a word with the noble earl at any time hereafter in order to elucidate this extremely urgent point <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that my noble friend will not withdraw his amendment <e> <s> this is an important point which the committee are now considering <e> <s> i should like to underline briefly what is involved <e> <s> the house has been treated in the course of this bill and in regard to other legislation and there is no party political argument in this because i should be saying exactly the same in a very humble way if this were government legislation and i happened to be sitting happily on the government side <e>", "<cs> with the concurrence of my noble friend lord underhill i should like just to thank the noble earl for his most gracious remark on the suggestion <e> <s> i hope he will realise that i believe i am right in saying that there is a very definite feeling in all sections of the committee on this matter <e> <s> i hope he will be able to make a practical contribution having heard the arguments put forward today <e>", "<cs> i do hope the noble lord will not think me discourteous but we have in front of us a very heavy agenda in respect of this bill <e> <s> the noble earl has been gracious enough to say that he sees the force of the arguments put to him and that he will consider them if with a view to helping <e> <s> would it not be the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may introduce very shortly one slightly differing thought on a matter which i know concerns not only the members of the committee but all citizens in the metropolis <e> <s> i introduce the point that i want to make with the feeling that the committee would always want the utmost consideration to be paid to anybody who is disabled and the idea of anyone who is disabled having the vehicle upon which they depend immobilised whether they have a white badge a red badge or any other badge i think fills all the members of the committee with a sense of abhorrence <e> <s> i am sure the minister feels exactly the same way as we all do when he is looking at it <e>", "<cs> we are all expressing a personal point of view and i am sure that that is understood <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister not only review some of the points put to him in regard to difficulties on clamping but also consider clamping down on the whole idea <e> <s> there are so many cases where citizens are going to be furious with the police where for example a car has been left and we are considering this type of example on a parking meter because a father has been called back from business because his child is slightly ill <e> <s> he then finds that he has to wait for the doctor and it is discovered that the child is rather more ill than was first thought <e> <s> the father goes to his car and sees the clamp on his vehicle <e> <s> it is bad enough to find that the car has been removed one goes and collects it takes a taxi if one can afford it or travels on public transport if it is working <e>", "<cs> i intervene only for the benefit of noble lords who are completely unhappy with the powers in clause anyway <e> <s> i wish to make it clear that those of us who feel that way obviously reserve our right when it comes to the clause stand part to take the view of the committee if that is a sensible course on the whole question of clause <e> <s> i should not like the minister to feel that those who accede to the question of his considering the various amendments and coming forward with a composite means that those of us who feel very strongly about the clause will be debarred from a discussion on the clause stand part and expressing our views on the clause <e>", "<cs> i rise as an indication of the fact that there is no question of politics in this at all <e> <s> therefore my appeal is to all sections of the committee <e> <s> indeed i am even trying by this speech to convert such an optimist am i my noble friend lord underhill to take a different view from the one he has just taken <e> <s> if i may summarise my reasons for saying that and the reasons given by other people in the course of the debates on the various amendments i will do it as follows <e>", "<cs> i should love to claim originality for my reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> but this was a point raised from the cross-benches on one of the amendments and the answer has to be that it is absolutely right <e> <s> although this is supposed to relieve the parking problem and especially the overstay on the parking meters the vehicle immobilised must occupy that space until the police arrive with an authorised person to unclamp <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness spoke if i may say so with great sincerity and in spite of the fact that part of her speech was directed at me i assure her that i accepted it with great relish <e> <s> she mentioned fire engines and said that she was a member of the fire brigade committee of the metropolis <e> <s> i am sure therefore that she will not mind my telling her that i was chairman of that committee for just over five years and thus can claim as she does to know a little about the fire brigade for which i am sure both of us have a great admiration <e> <s> i can only tell her that as chairman of that committee for over five years any question of having to waste even one minute and it would be longer than that in trying to unlock a car that had been clamped in this way from the point of view of the fire brigade would be a great disadvantage <e> <s> unlike the noble baroness i have used moderate language in saying a great disadvantage <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister was good enough to mention the words that this was a tidying-up clause <e> <s> may i beg of him in the name of the committee to tidy up the wording of the clause if it is meant to be a tidying-up operation <e> <s> may i give him just one example of really dreadful draftsmanship from the point of view of interpretation <e> <s> i will choose the shortest and simplest example but i could refer him to other parts of this clause <e> <s> will the noble earl and other members of the committee look with me at subsection which could obviously be worded in a very simple way <e> <s> i will just take the committee through its three lines <e>", "<cs> i referred a moment ago when i addressed the committee to what i learnt as a pupil at school in regard to english <e> <s> i also learnt as a pupil in the law that if you find that the court is with you then for heavens sake shut up and do not go on <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister with the usual courtesy which he shows and which he ascribed quite correctly to the noble lord behind him as well would kindly deal with this point <e> <s> he is talking about having used a machine <e> <s> i have no doubt that the machine he used was a very good one <e> <s> the point of this amendment is that there is no standard machine and there is therefore no point in the argument that some machines are very good and some machines are very bad <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has been using some very good ones i have no doubt <e> <s> i want to see a standard good machine <e> <s> at the present moment diverse kinds are being used <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for having paraphrased what i tried to say in regard to what i anticipate might be the ministers reply <e> <s> i now direct a question to the noble lord the minister which i hope he will be able to deal with in a helpful way <e> <s> i think the committee expects this <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister used i think rather tactlessly the word disgraceful <e> <s> would the minister care to suggest to this house what action is available to a group of lowly paid workers who are refused arbitration and whose verbal protests go unheeded <e> <s> is there anything other than industrial action which he can suggest they can take <e> <s> and would the noble lord the minister when referring to precedents in recent administrations tell the house whether there is any precedent for interviewing nurses and offering them an increase in pay which is higher than that for another group of workers represented by the same unions and for leaving the other representatives of the unions in another room and allowing them to read in the newspapers about the offer made to the nurses <e> <s> would he not describe that sort of conduct as not only foolish but also disgraceful <e>", "<cs> my lords by some administrative error my name as the spokesman for the opposition on this important bill was omitted from the list of speakers and i trust that your lordships will not claim immunity as a result of hearing my address this afternoon <e> <s> first i should like to add my tribute to the chairman of the committee the noble lord lord nugent of guildford whose face is familiar and very much liked in this house and whose administration of committees of this kind has once more been a great benefit to your lordships thanks to his long public experience <e> <s> i equally wish to express my gratitude to the members of the committee who have been extremely industrious <e> <s> i noticed that they sat on days and days consisting largely of hearing learned counsel an experience which some of us who have been privileged to have had have at times found a little tiring <e> <s> therefore one expresses gratitude to the members of the committee with some emphasis <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may add one short reason in support of the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> it is not only a question of the young person and it is not just a child but anyone under hearing what the reason is <e> <s> i think that it is a safeguard so that we have the court having to think very carefully about the restrictions we have imposed upon the custodial sentence and i think furthermore that it enables one to consider whether or not there should be an appeal because one can look at the reasons given and decide whether those reasons can be argued against on appeal as being unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be obliged to the noble lord for that intimation but it is rather late at third reading to put down an amendment of this kind which obviously has great import and which has to be studied very carefully <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would at least do this for us can any note on this clause reach those who are interested in the matter it may be that everyone present is so that at least we have ample opportunity of studying it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is always so courteous <e> <s> i did not wish her to give away too much <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister could help by informing the house whether the assurance which he gave with some reluctance but nevertheless with considerable charm is an undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may help the noble lord with a different kind of surgery <e> <s> having seen that indeed on the last occasion this was not completely cured by the doctor who was trying very <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise again somewhat disconsolate at the ministers reply <e> <s> it seemed to have this result <e> <s> first it is conceded that the supervising officer could not possibly monitor the subject of the supervision order and that the minister is therefore content to rely upon the off-chance of the offender being detected breaching a supervision order hardly a way of commanding respect for the law and for the order by those whom we are anxious to impress <e> <s> the second point that the minister made was that the supervising officer would be consulted and had to be consulted in regard to a negative restriction as in regard to any restriction <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree between now and the next occasion upon which we meet to review the review expenditure which he has just spoken about and let us have details either by letter or otherwise so that we can consider a figure which at the moment seems quite absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will forgive me for speaking twice my intervention was short last time and will be just as short this time <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister is saying that he agrees in principle and indeed wants to put this proposal into effect and that the only thing standing between him and that very desirable result is the question of expense does not the question of expense and its analysis by the noble lord the minister become imperative <e> <s> many of us feel that the figure he has put forward cannot be the correct one <e> <s> if he finds indeed that it is a minimal figure would he not agree that he could then carry out his promise and make this effective <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord does that i should like to say that i hoped that he was not going to give a detailed reply because i very fairly said what had not been considered last time <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is repeating with glorious paraphrase the very arguments that he advanced last time they are the same arguments <e> <s> if the minister will look at the bill he will see that it is not correct to say that the section provides that it is mandatory in the case of a child and only permissive in the case of a young person <e> <s> i do not want to continue the argument now but perhaps the noble lord will follow the wording with me and correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> we are looking at clause which states <e>", "<cs> of course not <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time a dream has been turned into a nightmare <e> <s> i indicated to the house that i felt it was quite wrong to deal with a matter of this kind especially when the noble lord the minister and i were at issue about what the clause actually means <e> <s> it is not fair to the house and it is not fair to the public <e> <s> therefore what i propose to do is to ask leave to withdraw this amendment at this stage and to come forward again at third reading when we can have a proper debate on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i only intervene because the noble baroness has indeed raised an interesting point as to where one goes on with this list and what one ought to delete <e> <s> if one tries to restrict oneself according to the rules this is hardly the place to do it but i would ask if i may with the permission of the house that the minister should look again at the description of assault of any kind bearing in mind that this does include an ordinary common assault <e> <s> would he not on reflection between now and third reading care to alter that to grievous bodily harm <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i should like to make one point because he kindly invited me to comment on his remarks on assault <e> <s> therefore with the leave of the house may i just say that i cannot conceive of a case where there could be an ordinary assault and one had a term of imprisonment of six months <e> <s> i was only trying to be realistic in saying that it must be a case of grievous bodily harm because otherwise the charge would be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would not be the view of the house and hopefully of the minister that by virtue of the fact that there are strong feelings first about the whole relevance of this amendment to this present bill and secondly about the merits of this clause which obviosuly ought to be debated in an entirely different atmosphere from this bill it would be appropriate to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house would permit me for one minute to address it a second time <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord renton for his gracious remarks which i do not deserve <e> <s> nobody is able to change lord rentons mind unless he wants to change it <e> <s> he has very much a mind of his own and we all appreciate it <e> <s> i rise only to point out to the noble lord the minister that with his usual courtesy he addressed himself to the clause in general but on this occasion did not answer the particular points for example hours as against days which one would have thought was useful the mental health matter which i mentioned and whether or not one should have the ability to require a person to be an out-patient as against an in-patient and the nomenclature which i suggested of probation centres <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord thought it inappropriate to deal with these matters on this occasion <e> <s> i want only to remind him that he did not deal with them and that as i said this is a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once that obviously that is a sensible course to adopt <e> <s> i am sure that the house will not impatient with me or my noble friends if by virtue of something in that letter we felt it necessary to raise a further amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will have noticed that i tried to avoid the use of the word probationer only out of my respect for the nursing service <e> <s> i carefully avoided that phrase but the noble minister did not follow my example <e> <s> in view of the terms of the noble ministers reply and especially the undertakings both for review and for consultation that he gave and his advice to the house about the ability to alter this by order i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and i express my gratitude to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i in turn am most grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord lord wigoder finishes his expression of gratitude may i just ask one question purely in order to see that we have not unconsciously slipped up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most inquisitive as to the subject matter and should love to join in if i may <e> <s> i was merely wanting to make sure that nobody had slipped up <e> <s> i am quite sure that i am wrong and that nobody has but perhaps i may just mention the point <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wigoder was very careful to point out that the statement that would <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble and learned friend i express the appreciation of the house to the minister <e> <s> my noble friends absence has led obviously to a very short speech instead of a long one <e>", "<cs> my lords mine is a far less good reason from one point of view for rising <e> <s> i have an idea that the next amendment is not going to be moved and i wanted to take this opportunity on behalf of all those who sit on my benches to say that bearing in mind the heavy responsibility and obligations of the noble lord the minister and indeed his anxieties over the past few weeks we want to express our thanks and commendation for the way in which he has handled the complicated report stage of a very complex bill over very lengthy hours in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords a house rich in quality if poor in quantity is very much indebted to the noble lord lord wigoder for putting down this motion this evening so that even at this hour we can concentrate upon a most important report <e> <s> i am quite sure that we all share the hope of the noble lord that this is not one of those reports which is put into a drawer and then forgotten <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord gardiner has certainly spoken about this matter on several occasions <e> <s> when that happens there is not only a waste of the extremely valuable time given by members of royal commissions but if i may introduce a sordid thought there is a waste of money <e> <s> i notice that the cost of producing this royal commission report with its analyses and its findings was over million <e> <s> it would therefore indeed be a waste of money quite apart from time of a very material nature if once again this were a report which found its way into a government drawer and did not receive a positive response <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the introduction into a house that governs the united kingdom of the phrase i rest my case which i can quite honestly say i have heard on television and in various films but never realised i would hear it from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to acquit the noble lord the minister of any desire to resist an amendment merely for the sake of resisting it and i am sure that when he says that he has considered the matter very carefully he has done so <e> <s> having said that i must confess that i completely fail to understand the reasoning behind his reply <e> <s> the minister asks us to rely upon clause <e> <s> clause is written in terms which mean and will be interpreted as so meaning that it is a clause which tells the board of the bus company that what they must do is to exercise their powers and dispose <e> <s> it takes an extraordinary reading of clause to say that it is meant to be the power for the secretary of state to tell the bus company not to exercise their powers by disposing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg of the noble viscount to do no such thing <e> <s> we are in a late stage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord the minister and those advising him have had opportunity after opportunity extending over a very long period to deal with the question of consultation and one would have thought that in any event this amendment which if i remember correctly has been down for a few days would certainly have given that period of time <e> <s> what your lordships have heard today is something that astounds me <e> <s> i am hoping to find another word in the vocabulary for astound because i find myself using that word much too often in the course of this bill <e> <s> i had better move next time to saying that it is a question of amazement <e> <s> but i shall leave it at being astounded on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a lot of discussion about philosophy this afternoon <e> <s> the philosophy that we have just heard expounded is the following where there are national assets not where there are assets in private hands and the query is whether or not they should be passed into the possession of the nation the philosophy expressed by the noble lord the minister is that the secretary of state for the time being should have the power in spite of the objections of those who have the responsibility of carrying out an essential national service with those assets to direct the national industry so concerned not necessarily just transport and even though that company knowing its responsibilities says that it differs from the secretary of state there is no appeal to the voice of the people <e> <s> that is what that means <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would deal with the central point which i believe is worrying noble lords <e> <s> that point is not whether there are safeguards in the bill in regard to the respectability of an authority that may be put before either house <e> <s> that disquiet is not indeed in regard to the safeguards of which the noble lord the minister has been good enough to remind the house <e> <s> the safeguard that is wanted is something which is very well known in commercial and professional life <e> <s> it is to avoid a conflict of interest and operators are anxious to see that there is no possible conflict of interest <e> <s> a conflict of interest is possible where somebody is engaged in the motor trade and essentially somebody who is engaged in the repair side of the motor trade because the operators feel and it may be a fault that will eventually not worry them but the principle is there or if i may copy the ministers favourite word the philosophy is there from the point of view of the operator that the act of parliament which will face them should be one which shows a manifestly fair proper impartial and disinterested authority and it is the disinterested part <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can take this opportunity to thank the noble lord the minister for his usual courtesy in sending me numerous letters which are extremely clear and most helpful in regard to a question that i raised and indeed which i think it may be for the convenience of the house that i speak to now because the noble lord is dealing with a whole series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be very grateful to the noble lord the minister for the reply he has just given to the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> but i am sure that the view which many members of your lordships house would want to express before approving this amendment is that the minister should undertake that the medical officer concerned will be available to give a report and to make an examination within hours of arrival <e> <s> that cannot create administrative problems <e> <s> as to how long he may take over his medical report <e> <s> i quite understand that the noble lord the minister may wish to consult others who can give him an average time a reasonable time and so on but there can be no doubt of the necessity at least to have the medical officer there within hours when there is a disturbed person of this kind entering prison <e> <s> i hope that the minister can at least give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what the noble lord the minister said about the necessity to get in all points before he rises may i make two short additional points in support of the amendment which may not have been formally moved at this stage only because the noble lord the ministers motion was before the house <e> <s> the amendment has not yet strictly been called but we are confining this to one debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister could not have been more generous nor could he have used more tolerant terms to describe the defects in the amendment that i have just moved <e> <s> i am more than happy if your lordships are to accept the <e>", "<cs> my lords there are helpful voices behind me that tell me that quite apart from my amendment having been faulty in construction i am now dealing with it in an equally faulty manner to achieve the object that i want <e> <s> as i understand it in these circumstances at third reading i do not withdraw the amendment but with intensified courage now put the amendment if i may to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been truly said by my noble friend lady david realistically this is the last opportunity that the house will have to deal with these provisions <e> <s> therefore whether or not the amendments which have been moved by my noble friend eventually meet with the approval of the house and i hope that they will i know that your lordships will want to give all their attention at this moment to vital provisions which affect the liberty of our youngest subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords they certainly were as brief <e> <s> this is a clause and i am sure the noble lord the minister will forgive me if i go into this a little more carefully but i hope equally briefly which entitles the courts in certain circumstances to allocate the payment of a fine or compensation or costs of course imposed upon a child in the first instance <e> <s> this clause enables the court to say that the parent shall bear the cost or the child against whom the fine penalty or award of costs was made shall bear it <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was once present in a law court and heard a very learned counsel who unfortunately was hard of hearing read from his notes in answer to the speech which was made by opposing counsel <e> <s> this learned counsel who was hard of hearing told the court that he disagreed completely with the interpretation of his learned friend in regard to various precedents <e> <s> the fact of course was that his learned friend had not quoted those cases at all <e> <s> i find myself very much in the same position but being grateful that the noble lord lord elton is certainly not hard of hearing and we have always found him not hard of understanding either <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i would never accuse the noble lord of being pettifogging in any respect but i think that the house will be very disappointed in the personal examples he gave of his lack of cultural and athletic appetite <e> <s> having said that <e> <s> i think it would not serve a useful purpose to the house if at this stage of the bill and at this time i tried to press this amendment <e> <s> i have put my point of view i have put the probation officers point of view <e> <s> the noble lord has given me a courteous reply <e> <s> in those circumstances i do not propose to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have loved to start off this afternoon with a reasonable reply to a most reasonable request <e> <s> my misfortune is that i feel i have a duty here <e> <s> these are important measures <e> <s> the form should be laid down <e> <s> as i said it can be changed from time to time and with great respect to the minister i do not intend to make a second speech to say that guidance will be given to various chief constables and that that necessarily will result in a clear english document that is capable of being understood by the average motorist is being far too optimistic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will have been impressed by the reasoning of the noble lord which really was this that a procurator fiscal in scotland can obviously be given the task of differentiating between the serious and the minor offence in a way in which it would be quite impossible or quite wrong to give to the police constable at the roadside <e> <s> let me say at once that that is an impressive argument <e> <s> unfortunately however if one looks at schedule on page of the bill and this i ask the noble lord to consider one comes across such trivial offences which are best judged on the spot that i think the case has been made for a transfer of those offences to schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel it is necessary for me to rise if only for a brief moment <e> <s> i say this with the greatest possible respect i would not accept the interpretation that the minister has put upon this very clearly worded amendment <e> <s> nowhere is there a directive to chief constables nowhere is the phrase that chief constables must have a uniform system <e> <s> the wording of the amendment is transparently clear <e> <s> it asks for a general written guideline of recommended practice so it is a practice that is to be recommended and not one that is to be insisted upon <e> <s> it is not mandatory it is a guideline <e> <s> it does not express any orders to the chief constable except to say that the objective and that is the word which is used in the amendment is to ensure uniformity of police practice <e> <s> so with the greatest possible respect to the minister the interpretation he has put upon this just does not stand up <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord permit me to interrupt him with the leave of the house before he resumes the seat he occupies with such distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord would want to concentrate upon this <e> <s> brevity is something to be admired <e>", "<cs> but where brevity does not say what one wants to say it is something to be abhorred <e> <s> the noble lord does not say what is the objective or policy of this directive it merely says that guidelines will be issued <e> <s> one minister could issue a guideline if he wished to say that he does not like the idea of uniformity <e> <s> my noble friends amendment actually states what the objective of the guidelines should be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make the most strong contribution that i shall be making the whole of the day to your lordships by suggesting that the grammatical way of dealing with the matter in case the government wish to consider it is to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who participated in the debates last time and who does not intend to pursue this course today in order to express his own personal condemnation on grounds of relationships between the ordinary citizen and the police and on many other grounds of any idea of applying these devices to a vehicle so as to immobilise it may i say that i still hold that view but will not oppress your lordships with the repetition of it this afternoon <e> <s> we have now reached the stage where we are trying to improve if we can the wording of any clauses which deal with the immobilisation device <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak for a second time with the leave of the house i wonder whether the noble earl can deal with the question of the word direction instead of assisted by <e>", "<cs> i understood the minister to say that he agreed with what i had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express a personal word of gratitude for all the consideration the government have given to this matter of the device <e> <s> i have already made my own position clear and my noble friend with his usual tolerance allows me still to sit by his side even though he and i have very differing views on the device and its admissibility in this legislation <e> <s> having had to concede the principle that this device is allowed to the authorities i want to make only two comments on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house will forgive me if i try to concentrate for a moment on amendment no <e> <s> x and the reply made to it by the noble earl <e> <s> it is not only a question always of a strict interpretation of an act of parliament <e> <s> one tries if possible without extending the wording to express the spirit of an act of parliament and subsection deals with the secretary of states ability after conducting experiments by order to extend the principal sections to any area for the first time <e> <s> that is a very important stage to reach after an experiment to decide to extend to another area for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness explain to a very interested house how she made this experiment and when and in what circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether while we are dealing with the wording and the meaning of clause i should be in order in reminding the noble earl the minister of something that i ventured to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the debate can be completed subject obviously to any noble lord wanting to say anything after i have sat down by covering another aspect to which the minister referred <e> <s> that is the inference from amendment no <e> <s> t <e> <s> there is a misprint in the marshalled list incidentally <e> <s> it should read <e>", "<cs> i have only one point to raise with the minister on this amendment my lords and i do not think anyone will wish to comment on the application of the immobilisation procedure to servants of the crown <e> <s> but there is great public feeling about the way in which many members of the diplomatic corps have treated the question of obstruction with vehicles and notices of fines that have been placed on their car windscreens and there is an exemption <e> <s> i wonder if the noble earl the minister can tell the house whether or not members of the diplomatic corps are exempt from the immobilisation clause clause and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl the minister if i may say this by leave of the house <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> the chief whip is always so helpful and so kind <e> <s> i wanted to say to the noble earl before he sits down that i hope that the feeling that has been expressed publicly and in another place will enable guidance to be given to the police that in had cases this exemption should not be given <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be most appropriate in a transport bill to let anything ride that wants to <e> <s> but i must say this although the noble earl has been as clear lucid and eloquent as he always is and certainly as courteous as he always is i do not follow his argument and i do not think your lordships will either <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say with great respect that he has not clearly informed the house what the position is under this amendment <e> <s> i know that he wants to be fair <e> <s> this amendment enables the secretary of state to make this transfer from schedule to schedule without an order <e> <s> therefore he can do it simply without the expense of it and without the trouble of it when it is in schedule and he wants to move it over to schedule <e> <s> i would have thought with respect he could have accepted that position <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate wishes me to delete the word so and then will accept the amendment i readily agree to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may add just a few words to what my noble friend had said the plea for uniformity was not merely for uniformity for <e>", "<cs> my lords may i convey my gratitude to the noble earl the minister for the very kind things he has said <e> <s> every time i read the act when this bill has become an act on the statute book i shall remember when i come to this section the very small contribution that i was able to make in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened as it always does with the greatest of care to what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> in addition to being i hope courteous i wish i could follow with an expression of confidence in what he has said <e> <s> first of all to make a comparison with the breath testing equipment is really not to provide a correct analogy at all <e> <s> one knows perfectly well that that breath testing equipment first of all is a colour changing equipment and therafter is a measurement of content of alcohol if an analysis is taken <e> <s> that does not need the same absolute precision that corroborative evidence in regard to speeding offences requires <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged i was right the first time <e> <s> it could only be evidence brought before the court that it was of a type <e> <s> it would not be the evidence which i think this house requires which is that it shall be of a standard which has been approved by the secretary of state <e> <s> this is merely of a type which has been approved <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friends in another place pressed this matter very hard in committee and the right honourable and learned gentleman the solicitor-general was good enough on that occasion to give an undertaking <e> <s> that undertaking has now been inplemented and i am sure that we are all grateful for it <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has said it means that capital will not be taken into account where supplementary benefit is paid <e> <s> that seems a very logical sensible and humane thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords here again this is a most welcome amendment <e> <s> your lordships may remember that great diffidence was expressed certainly on this side of the house but in many quarters of the house about the power to revoke an order where a payment had been ordered to be made and had not been made <e> <s> this makes it clear that the court will take into account various considerations before revoking the order <e> <s> they are proper just consideration and i think we ought to be grateful for this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while the expression topping-up may be known to the legal profession i do not know that it is known as familiarly to all your lordships <e> <s> it is as the noble and learned lord indicated a rather objectionable practice that there would be of a solicitor for example i prefer to choose my own side of the profession in order not to be offensive to any other side of the profession saying well i have got a legal aid certificate but i am afraid that the charges that i would be entitled to thereunder do not console me at all and therefore i would like to charge you if i am to act for you an additional sum <e> <s> this is prohibited in the civil legal aid and obviously ought to be prohibited in criminal legal aid and that is so <e> <s> so that i do not leave the other side of the profession completely out of it that would similarly apply where there was a question of a silk not being authorised and in fact a silk comes on the scene in order that payment may be proffered to him in respect of his services when that is not covered by the criminal legal aid certificates <e>", "<cs> my lords with his usual artistry the noble lord the minister has summarised and paraphrased with great elegance of phrase precisely what my amendment on behalf of my noble friends was meant on third reading to put into the bill <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he said and i am equally grateful for the way in which the undertaking that he gave has been faithfully fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only for a few minutes i promise your lordships as possibly the only member in the house this afternoon who was a member of the wolfenden committee which sat some it seems odd to remember it years ago <e> <s> it is surprising that some years later we are wondering whether the recommendations of that committee should be carried into effect in northern ireland <e> <s> i wish to make only a couple of observations in order at least from my own point of view to try to clear up some of the points which have been raised this afternoon and which may lead to a little misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously it was to some purpose that i rose if only for a few minutes since my noble friend is under a misunderstanding <e> <s> i repeat that homosexuality itself was never an offence in english law <e> <s> the mere tendency to have homosexual thoughts the mere desire to have homosexual activities was never in fact an offence under our law <e> <s> it was merely giving vent to those desires and in fact committing homosexual acts which was an offence <e> <s> that was a distinction which was very definitely drawn in the wolfenden report <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend lord molloy sits down i wonder whether he will permit me to give a personal explanation <e> <s> it must have been my fault if i did not make my position clear <e> <s> i will try to do so now and i promise your lordships that i will do so briefly <e> <s> i was a member of the wolfenden committee which made the recommendation that became the act my noble friend regards as so merciful <e> <s> secondly he must have completely misunderstood me when i was explaining that in law to think that it might be a good thing to steal was no crime and that therefore to think that it might be a good idea to have homosexual relationships was no crime that it was homosexuality <e> <s> i entirely agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords this would appear to be a very sensible amendment and we concur <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am able to assist the house by saying that we concur <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will remember well the debate that took place on this matter when we <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously right following upon our former deliberations and we certainly concur <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments make the bill very much clearer than it was before in regard to the actual procedure of transferring the enforcement of the debt over to the high court from the county court and therefore it is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely rise to express cross gratitude not angry gratitude but equal gratitude from the law society to the noble and learned lord and his department for the way in which their submissions were accepted by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it was in fact a misadventure that they were not consulted before and it is a fact as the noble and learned lord has said that solicitor recorders have been extremely useful in dealing with matters that require urgent consideration and where other members of the judiciary might not have been available so quickly namely in urgent matrimonial proceedings and especially in wardship cases to which the noble and learned lord made reference <e> <s> having expressed my gratitude it will be obvious that we concur with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to say that the official referees business becomes more and more prolific and with building disputes and matters of that kind which are normally referred to the official referee still remaining numerous in spite of the depression in the building industry it is obviously useful that there should be an addition to those who are able to sit as official referees <e> <s> one therefore regards this as a most useful amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord will forgive my ignorance if i betray it all too often from this dispatch box and again on this occasion but i was not quite clear of the need to abolish the position of the deputy master of the court of protection <e> <s> possibly the noble and learned lord with his usual courtesy will explain the necessity for the power <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously a sensible provision in that questions ought to be directed to a prospective juror if necessary immediately after the summons has been issued or between the issue of a summons and the time a juror attends court <e> <s> it is of course interesting that this means that the questioning at that time as indeed when he attends court can result in a charge being preferred against a juror and i think that this ought generally to be known not only if he does not reveal a cause for disqualification which exists but equally if he tries to pretend that he has a disqualification which he does not have in order to try to avoid jury service <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i had a distinct impression i may he completely wrong that the noble and learned lord was encouraging me to be brief and therefore i intend to accept that encouragement <e> <s> i merely wish to say that the noble and learned lord has graciously said that this was an opposition amendment in another place and that the government had been good enough to accept it <e> <s> there have been cases within the memory of all your lordships in recent years which have caused grave anxiety where death or a severe injury has occurred while someone has been in custody <e> <s> it is proper that it should now be part of the law of the land that in such cases where a death occurs a jury should be present <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain the house i promise for only a few moments <e> <s> it is interesting to notice how things become somewhat onerous arduous and subject to criticism when we are not very careful about our legislation <e> <s> the position is terrifically odd under the explosive substances act <e> <s> what has happened until now this arose recently before a magistrate who himself did not know what this procedure was was that if a charge was to be brought under this act a charge had to be brought first in the court before the attorney generals fiat was applied for <e> <s> this meant in effect that the director of public prosecutions would not wish to prefer the charge until he knew that the attorney general was likely to grant his fiat <e> <s> that would mean that he would consult with the attorney general and the attorney general would say that it was likely or not likely <e> <s> if it was likely the charge would be preferred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is always right and proper and i am sure that the noble and learned lord will agree with me that when one of the academic lawyers comes forward and lends his aid to the legislators it ought to be appreciated <e> <s> indeed it was a learned professor of the law who suggested these amendments i think the noble and learned lord will agree with me and saw that they were brought before another place <e> <s> they are useful technical amendments and they put the position right and i think one ought to express ones gratitude to the academic lawyers as well as the practising ones <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an ungracious act when debating the gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the privilege tonight to wind up this debate on a bill moved with her usual grace and ability by the noble baroness <e> <s> lady vickers <e> <s> i had a similar privilege of winding up the debate on the second reading of the british nationality bill and i remember that debate so well <e> <s> i can remember those who from various sides of this house pointed out that the bill which was then before us was ill-considered and that there had been no proper consultations with the dependent territories of which the falkland islands was one <e> <s> it was said that there was much misunderstanding as a result of a lack of public relations work even if the provisions of the bill were right <e> <s> i can remember the speeches made by the most reverend primate and by some of the right reverend prelates on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i specially did not interrupt the noble lord the minister when he dealt with another of my points to which i shall not refer <e> <s> i do not believe that the house would like me to do sohowever regarding the point to which the noble lord the minister is now referring may i remind him of the very clear statement which i made to which he has not referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for bringing this matter to your lordships attention <e> <s> it is always pleasant to have a reference to the pearson report if only because it immediately brings to his feet the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who is to follow me who was such an eminent member of the pearson committee and whose voice it is always a delight to hear in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government consider cheering us up a little bit by making the next assumption not the square leg assumption but the silly mid-off assumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i must interrupt the noble lord if he will allow me to do so <e> <s> may i say from these benches that whichever way we vote it will not be on the basis of any matter of party policy <e> <s> it will be a question of our individual consciences <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to detain your lordships for only one minute in support of what the noble and learned lord has just said and as someone who proudly sat in county hall for over years <e> <s> may i say and may it go out from this house that when

<e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have heard very erudite and eloquent references to some of the problems involved in and created by the decision in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will not mind if i intervene to say that my point was that i thought it to be necessary to do something because of the conveyancing and other difficulties arising out of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down will he permit me to intervene <e> <s> i have the whole of that passage noted very clearly for quotation <e> <s> if i omitted the words to which he referred <e>

balanced view could indicate to the house whether the increase in the purchase of houses from local authorities has also led peculiarly enough to an increase in the number of tenants requiring housing from local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister realise that out of is on any view a very large percentage <e> <s> does he also realise the difference between local authorities which have a social obligation and trustees who have obligations under a trust <e> <s> does he think that it is proper that beneficiaries under a trust which is a charitable trust should be given the opportunity which can be enforced upon trustees of purchasing accommodation which is supposed to be there on the basis of charitable trusts for the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be indebted to the noble lord lord lyell for his explanation of these regulations and for the familiar way in which he uttered the names that apply to scots law and which are not so familiar to many of your lordships <e> <s> he showed a familiarity with them which is <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord whose name has just been referred to is engaged at this moment upon other affairs and apologises that he is not able to be with your lordships <e> <s> he is one of the more fortunate members of your lordships house who has not therefore been detained until this moment and likely to be detained hereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships will feel that this is a useful little bill <e> <s> it is one that is very suitable as a private members bill and it has been presented to us by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway with his usual clarity and persuasiveness and in the typical tones of father christmas <e> <s> i shall try as a non-specialist in this field to use simple language in endeavouring to support the bill the object of which is very short and it is this <e> <s> the trade marks act covers goods which are used in trade and many people such as those who are specialists in this field the professions and other people engaged in services which as your lordships have rightly been reminded are so vital to our economy both in regard to foreign currency earnings and to our own home market have thought for a long time that these services should also be included by way of protection and control in trade marks legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is aware that paragraph talks about a passing off action being unsatisfactory as compared with a registered service trade mark <e> <s> is he further aware that while he is deeply loved by this house his speech on behalf of the government in protection of industry was one of the weakest and most calamitous that i have ever heard <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from the question of the saving of expense to legal aid would the noble and learned lord agree that the conciliation service is so valuable in removing the adversarial content of family disputes between husband and wife and in helping them round the table to reach civilised conclusions which not only shorten the time and help the children in the family but equally lead them as human beings to come to agreement by accord rather than as a result of a judicial decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house has a sense of horror at what occurred on friday and has caught the public apprehension of what the home secretary himself has described as an incident which must never happen again <e> <s> may i put this in the form of a question as i should do <e> <s> is not the house very conscious of figures which show not just annual figures of authorisation of arms possession some for this year if one takes the figures for nine months and then converts them for months but the daily figure of authorisation in the metropolitan area of per day <e> <s> your lordships may think it is right that there should be a thorough inquiry <e> <s> following upon what the noble lord lord shinwell has said and if i may say so he has anticipated a remark from this front bench quite apart from the question of the director of prosecutions investigation of the facts presented to him by the commissioners inquiry would it not be more realistic in view of public disquiet to appoint some person of independent responsibility be he a lawyer or be he whoever in order that the public may know that the inquiry and the facts which go to the director of public prosecutions have been completely independently examined <e>", "<cs> my lords may i revert to the answer which was given by the noble earl to my noble friend in the first instance and repeat a question which is often asked by the opposition of the government how soon is soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount with his usual courtesy would allow this short intervention which i make only because we are all so anxious to follow very valuable points which he always makes <e> <s> clause of the bill only provides a public right to look at the entries in the register which will merely show that somebody is using a computer for certain purposes <e> <s> there is no public right under clause to look at what is in the computer <e>", "<cs> my lords in attempting to wind up on behalf of my noble friends in the opposition what has been a most entertaining and <e> <s> i hope constructive debate i would make two preliminary observations <e> <s> the first is that i promise to try to abide by the rule which i thought guided this house that on second reading one debated the general principles of a bill and left it to other stages to move amendments be they about criminal or civil offences or whether the registrar should employ or people <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i wish to pay a tribute and i am sure i speak for all your lordships to the excellence of the report we are now considering and to the typically lucid and forceful manner in which it has been introduced by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> he has the great ability blessed as he is with that logical and clear mind accompanied by such felicity of language to address us on the most complex subjects in such simple and intelligible terms and he has done that for our general benefit this evening <e> <s> in adding the membership of sub-committee e as recipients of our gratitude i can do so without any immodesty because through other duties in your lordships house i was unable as a member of that sub-committee to participate in the preparation and approval of this particular report <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister continues and because the house is so anxious as has been made clear in this debate could he tell the house why the government could not consider support for a bill which would contain a starting date for registration which was sufficiently far ahead to enable the clearing up which he thinks is a barrier in the trade marks registry at the moment to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not think i am too persistent <e> <s> i was not in fact mentioning a point which he had not himself brought to the attention of the house as a reason for not supporting the bill and that was the present congested state of applications in the trade marks registry <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister wishes to take time to consider the remark and cannot answer tonight then of course i shall be courteous enough to bow to that <e> <s> but what i am asking him specifically is if this is one of the points that he wishes to bring into this debate could he inform us why the bill could not have support with a starting date for registrations which takes into account the relief of the congestion which is now taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he referred to international exhaustion and i wonder whether he is aware of the fact that there is also exhaustion in members of your lordships house <e> <s> would he be good enough if he sees fit to pass on to his noble friends who arrange the business of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would assure the noble lord lord elton that he is the recipient of not only the sympathy of this house but its appreciation for the way he has dealt with a very useful humanitarian but nevertheless somewhat complex measure <e> <s> it is a delight if we have to meet on a friday that we should deal with matters which are non-controversial as they are this morning all three of them <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i welcome this particular measure which is indeed a humanitarian one <e> <s> i have little if anything to say in regard to those who are housebound or who are in a hospital or an institution and are therefore deemed to be detained under the provisions of this bill <e> <s> it obviously is a most kindly thing that those who are by reasons of health unable to visit a place of worship or a registrars office will be accommodated now by a doctors cerificate saying that the condition is likely to last for some three months in the case of somebody who is housebound and therefore the registrar will with great humanity attend at the usual place of residence which in the case of the individual concerned usually means the home so that the marriage can be solemnised there in accordance with due form <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is being kind as he always is and is dealing with i know he would realise a very important point <e> <s> did he mean by that reply that although it will not be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted and no doubt your lordships will be to the noble lord lord teviot for two things <e> <s> first because he has given some of us who have enjoyed paying tribute to

reading itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord the minister for what was a perfectly proper <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing i would want to do is to hold up the business of the house purely because a speech that i might make is more suitable for a later stage than at the stage at which i am now making it <e> <s> i am perfectly content to reserve my speech for a later stage if that be the will of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords on an earlier occasion i badly wanted to address your lordships on certain aspects of this bill <e> <s> the house has been spared what might have been a lengthy speech of mine by the points which have been raised on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i noted with envy how speakers upon that amendment managed to give general expression to their views upon the bill as a whole and the difficulties created by it <e> <s> the envy i assure your lordships is a moderate one and from my point of view i have no criticism whatsoever of those who suggested that i might speak later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will not mind my intervening if only in order to make him smile and nothing else but i cannot imagine that such a notification is one that will be so precious to the person who receives it that he will retain it for years <e>", "<cs> my lords very often in your lordships house the intervention of lawyers is an annoyance <e> <s> but sometimes i think we find that their experience and the way in which they can point to that experience does help the house <e> <s> i hope this is such an occasion because we have drifted from principle to some sort of examination of the legal position and whether that is satisfactory <e> <s> as always we are all indebted to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for giving us the benefit of his experience <e>", "<cs> my lords as is customary when three judges of the court of appeal have spoken the third one being the most learned of the lot says i agree and have nothing to add <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if some members of your lordships house were not present for their own speeches <e>", "<cs> that may be the only time that i get acclaim in the course of my remarks to your lordships <e> <s> the committee will be interested in the definitions contained in this bill for three reasons <e> <s> i want if i may to differentiate the other two reasons from the reason why i am moving these amendments <e> <s> some members of the committee will be feeling as they did on second reading that the definitions in the bill be they of data information or personal data all terribly important in a technical bill do not go too far some other members of the committee will be anxious to see that they go even further than they do <e> <s> that is not the matter upon which i wish to address your lordships on these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and indeed to the minister for the way in which they have dealt with these amendments which i have tried to assure the committee are not the result of pedantry <e> <s> i do believe with great respect to the minister that he did not get the gravamen of my charge <e> <s> if my charge is incorrect that is another matter but the very gravamen of it was that in the bill the draftsman has sometimes used the words data

not speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they are not my amendments <e>", "<cs> in the spirit that i mentioned i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the ministers answer on this point is a very forceful one and in spite of the fact that the noble lord lord wigoder with his usual clarity and eloquence moved this amendment most ably as we would expect of him i think that the noble lord the minister has answered him <e> <s> what worries many of us is that it means that if you put through a computer that an employee has been absent from work due to illness for days in a period of six months and then put after it malingerer it having been put through the computer the employee is entitled to a copy <e> <s> if you have in your computer employee absent days through illness and you put in your file which you keep of that employee absent days through illness malingerer then the employee is not entitled to a copy <e>", "<cs> i found myself almost trembling at the consequences of the single word transferring being inserted into the bill whereas i had thought that it was a helpful amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord who added to the suggestion that one might have to look carefully at the word transferring <e> <s> it is right that as a general principle one does not insert otiose words in a bill and it is dangerous to do so <e> <s> of course it is equally dangerous to use a word that is capable of argument by lawyers as to whether it includes something that one meant to include or excludes it <e> <s> that is why i wanted to make doubly sure by inserting the word transferring <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord lord wigoder was endeavouring to help me and i am grateful to him but it was precisely the point that he <e>", "<cs> the committee will have noted that the minister has a most interesting psychological reaction <e> <s> i introduced the umbrella for its normal purpose of protecting and helping and the noble lord the minister immediately regarded the offensive operation of an umbrella as one of poking somebodys eyes out <e> <s> in exactly the same way my amendment was supposed to be a most helpful covering amendment as a normal umbrella would be <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord does not interpret it as being an aggressive one <e>", "<cs> i tried to say earlier and the noble lord lord wigoder said it rather better that it was a total nonsense to have a bill which protected the individual in regard to records that might be compiled about him on a computer but not in regard to manual records <e> <s> in saying that i in no way intended to say that precisely the same regulations would apply <e> <s> one realises that manual records if one attempted to define them could encompass a great many things

would bring such records under some sort of surveillance in regard to the principles which are laid down in the first schedule to this bill <e>", "<cs> listening to this debate in the sense of the ministers contribution and that of the noble viscount lord bledisloe i am wondering really why we ever signed the convention in this form and why the lawyers advising us did not say that this was a clause to which we ought not to agree because it was covered by something else <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has given an undertaking and provided that undertaking i say this with a smile is to read as well the very cogent contribution made by the noble lord lord wigoder as well as my own humble remarks and to consider the matter further i am perfectly content to ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i little thought that my short speech would have earned the rather lengthy reply which the noble lord the minister was courteous enough to give to this amendment <e> <s> i should like to have the opportunity of studying the many reasons as to why these innocent looking words cannot go in for the sake of clarity and possibly revert to the matter again at a later stage <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i remember that the noble lord lord bellwin yesterday put down his papers on the front bench and said i propose to speak from my heart and not from my brief <e> <s> i wonder whether the <e>", "<cs> whenever the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor addresses the house or a committee he is listened to with respect and if i may say so with affection <e> <s> the affection is there and so is the respect but the point that i tried to emphasise was that this should not necessarily be indeed would not be under this amendment an appointment in regard to the lay members by the lord chancellor himself <e> <s> it would be in consultation with the secretary of state <e> <s> if therefore one trusts the secretary of state as we all do and the secretary of state makes nominations which are acceptable to the lord chancellor in that he does not see any very good reason as to why he should comment on them adversely the appointments will go through <e> <s> we cannot have it both ways either we trust the secretary of state or we do not <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to detain the committee long upon this matter <e> <s> there are a few essential points that ought to be made in the hope that the noble lord the minister will consider them not tonight but in the interval between now and the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support the remarks of the noble lord lord wigoder for the short reason that if we are anxious not to overburden the registrar or the secretary of state especially at the commencement of operations under the bill can one imagine for a moment the volume of applications there would be for exemption if there were a general provision in the bill which provided that the secretary of state could <e>", "<cs> there is a voice in this chamber which sometimes sounds and we hear it whether it be from the woolsack or from the front bench opposite and i believe that that voice was heard to say that there might be inconsistency between amendments no <e> <s> and no <e> <s> <e> <s> i only wanted to follow what the noble lord has just said by explaining briefly because i think it may be of use that there are two ways in which codes of practice may come into existence <e> <s> one under this amendment if the registrar sees fit he can draw them up himself having sought the advice he finds necessary <e> <s> secondly there is the opportunity for computer users themselves who happen to be in a certain category to draw up their own codes of practice if they want to submit them to the registrar and ask for his blessing upon them <e> <s> in those circumstances they are alternative ways of dealing with codes of practice and they are complementary <e> <s> i thought it might be useful if i gave that indication now in view of that voice that we love to hear even when it is not intended that we should <e>", "<cs> i must even at this hour interrupt the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i had hoped that my intervention would stop him from saying what he has just said <e> <s> the intervention was that there are two ways that codes of practice may come into existence <e> <s> first the registrar if this amendment is passed and also from the various bodies of computer users if amendment no <e> <s> is passed <e> <s> they are not inconsistent and while joining with the noble lord lord mottistone on one amendment however reluctant we may be to do so nevertheless we reserve our rights to elicit his support on no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment and again with a promise about brevity i wonder whether the minister would answer a short question <e> <s> i may be wrong about what i am going to say and if so i apologise <e> <s> if this bill has no reference to codes of practice because the noble lord does not like the idea can he tell me which provision in the bill in the absence of codes of practice or any reference to them makes it a crime if you breach the code of practice <e>", "<cs> the minister is completely wrong if i may say so <e> <s> there is nothing in this amendment which says that it is a criminal offence to breach a code of practice <e> <s> the whole basis of the ministers reply rests upon a platform which has collapsed beneath him <e> <s> despite the fact that he still sits on his seat with the platform having collapsed i must say that it is a completely wrong reply to the points that have been made by the noble lord lord mottistone my noble and learned friend and myself <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister may think that it is the intention <e> <s> i have looked at the clause and i do not see any criminal offence created at all <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord mottistone thought that it was going to be a criminal offence to breach the code of practice <e> <s> i certainly did not <e> <s> therefore as i said the answer is a bad one <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble baroness but if she would kindly be seated for one moment i should like to ask whether it is in order for her to be dealing with voting on womens funds in a united nations association on the second reading debate of the transport bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness resumes her seat if indeed we all indulge in speculation of this kind in regard to various matters other than transport your lordships will find themselves here beyond midnight and not terribly interested in the discussions which are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will i hope take my word for it when i say that i would never want to be discourteous to her <e> <s> but we have now had a speech from her and i appeal to the front bench opposite now in charge of the conduct and guidance of the house to say whether the whole of the last or minutes of that speech in which names of estate agents have been quoted and names of public companies and so on given are in order on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> it is a precedent which i say with respect is extremely bad and may be copied by all members of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords unhappy is the lot of the twentieth speaker in a second reading debate who rises to address your lordships in order to wind up on behalf of the opposition at pm <e> <s> i suggest that the only way in which he can redeem himself is by endeavouring not to repeat the very eloquent speeches that have been made before him and he ought in my view and i hope your lordships will accept this merely to make some general comments and then resume his seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that in this house one ought to compare politicians nor ought one to refer to those who have fallen in any party be their name heath or whatever it may be <e> <s> it is a dangerous exercise <e> <s> therefore i propose to close my remarks by saying that it is a bad bill that has come to us from another place <e> <s> it is bad for the reasons that have been advanced in this debate and to which i have ventured to refer <e> <s> we are bound by a tradition in this house when bills come up to us from the democratically elected chamber <e> <s> but i think that those of us who will see the second reading of this bill nodded through will do so with regret and we shall do our best in the later stages to see what we can do with a bad bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be interrupting the noble lord at a wrong place <e> <s> i apologise but before he moves on to another point i am sure he wants to be just <e> <s> he will know that rates bear a relevance to rents <e> <s> what is driving so many people out of the centre of london are the huge rents that are being charged <e> <s> he must not just talk about rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the house owes a great debt which i ought to express on the motion that the bill do now pass to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for having piloted the bill through to this stage assisted as he was and i am sure that he will want me to mention this by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran who placed his considerable experience in the field of trade marks at the disposal of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> i think i am correctly interpreting though the noble lord lord campbell can speak for himself that in saying that the tribute was meant entirely for the noble lord himself and not for his department <e>", "<cs> my lords to revert to the original question whatever errors may have been made in the past through one being misled by argentina is it not horrific that our forces stand in some danger the threat of war still being there so far as argentina is concerned with the threat of being killed or injured by weapons that we are helping to supply <e> <s> does this not come outside the realm of what the minister called contracts in regard to supplies under arrangements made before the war with the argentine <e>", "<cs> if i have correctly understood this amendment i imagine it must be possibly the most dangerous amendment to the whole existence of this bill that the committee will have to consider <e> <s> does the noble lord lord mottistone mean by it that over somebodys notepaper however large and important a public corporation and however respectable there will be written the words guaranteed status under this bill <e> <s> will that give the impression that the government have guaranteed the integrity of the company concerned to comply with part i <e> <s> or does it mean no such thing at all but that certain corporations granted that status will be completely exempt from part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said and for the attention he has given to the amendment <e> <s> i said frankly that it could be that the matter was already covered within the wording and i was as i said merely trying to make things abundantly clear clear beyond a peradventure <e> <s> if the minister on the advice he has received is absolutely certain that the point is covered i would not wish to press the point <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether if not this afternoon certainly between now and the next stage of the bill the noble lord the minister will reconsider a little more thoroughly the answer to the question which my noble and learned friend put to him <e> <s> as i understood the question it was concerned with the following point <e> <s> the registrar can do only that which he is authorised by the bill to do <e> <s> if a data user or a data subject asks the registrar for advice upon which he wishes to act and acts one obviously hopes in good faith the registrar is entitled to say first of all from his point of view i am afraid that i have no right under this bill to give you advice <e> <s> secondly if he does not adopt that unhelpful attitude it could be said that he has given advice and that he was acting <e>", "<cs> to any objective observer of this debate the fact that the noble lord lord mottistone is an opponent of this amendment ought to be one of the most winning features if i may say so in the division lobby <e> <s> but having said that as i know the noble lord knows with a smile may i return to the actual argument <e>", "<cs> if the committee finds me speechless hereafter they will understand the reason <e>", "<cs> in the past i have had occasion to mention the phrase and i borrowed it from a very eminent former member of your lordships house that some departments have the happy knack of finding a problem for every solution <e> <s> i pay my tribute to the department of the noble lord the minister in precisely those terms this afternoon <e> <s> if one had only heard from the minister a tribute to the very principle of having codes of practice recommended as mandatory in the lindop committee recommended as voluntary by the governments own white paper and if the noble lord the minister had said i find it wrong that there should be protection for months i find it wrong as one noble lord intervened to say that each individual user should have the right to submit a code of practice it should be a body or i find it wrong that the registrar should have the duty of considering such individual applications and therefore only applications from associations or groups of users then i think the committee would have been a little more content with the answer <e>", "<cs> i think that what the noble lord the minister has said about this important provision is of such a measure of seriousness that one ought to consider what he has said and decide later what position to take <e> <s> i make only one quick observation <e> <s> it is that while we consider on our side i hope that the noble lord the minister will also consider on his side what he has said about subsection of clause meaning that the registrar has discretion as to whether or not to serve an enforcement notice in circumstances where the contravention has not caused or is not likely to cause any person damage or distress <e> <s> i would have said with deep respect that subsection on any ordinary interpretation limits him to the power to serve an enforcement notice by the consideration as to whether the contravention does cause or is likely to cause any person damage or distress and that the wording if it is to fit what he has said ought to be that he should take into account possibly among other considerations the matters mentioned in subsection <e> <s> we will possibly both of us if i may say so be considering what has emerged this afternoon <e> <s> it may be convenient if i say that i deem myself to have spoken not only to amendment no <e> <s> but to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> if i may quickly deal with the helpful point of the noble lord lord wigoder he may well be right but i am sure that he will agree with me that acceptance of this amendment or non-acceptance will not depend upon the interchange of these words <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord the minister if he will forgive my saying it is asking your lordships committee not to fulfil a very heavy duty that is cast upon it <e> <s> there are no precedents for all this no precedents to guide the registrar and we in this chamber would be failing in our duty if we did not give him some guidance and say that a de-registration notice apart from my point about may or shall is only to be served where there is this gross or persistent breach of the principles or the provisions of the bill <e> <s> in these circumstances and because we feel it is our duty to say that the registrar should be guided in this unprecedented field it appears to be appropriate unfortunately to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i shall look with interest to see those who divided one way or the other on the last amendment and with particular interest to see which way the noble lord lord mottistone voted because if the words grossly or persistently had been inserted and indeed the word serious the purpose of his amendment would have been fulfilled by virtue of the fact that it would not be a question of rectifying on notice <e> <s> before the de-registration notice could be initiated there would have to be gross or persistent breaches <e> <s> i leave the comment there <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mottistone speaks may i say that despite all i said about looking at the division lobby list what the noble lord the minister has just said has convinced me that my noble friends and i ought to support the amendment <e> <s> my reason for saying this is that the noble lord the minister referred to the appeal procedure and said that if the registrar had been shown to use the sledgehammer when something lighter would have <e>", "<cs> i shall not waste the time of the committee in further arguing the matter <e> <s> i shall look at what the minister said and in the meantime i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to explain to the committee one point that arises out of these amendments <e> <s> they do in fact have their source in the law society of which i have the privilege to be a member <e> <s> i did have a word with the noble lord the minister about raising these points on clause stand part because i felt it was unreasonable to put down amendments so late <e> <s> it is an extraordinary situation that the opposition front bench is more considerate presumably to the minister than his own noble friends <e> <s> i thought i ought to explain that that is why the amendments are not down in my name and that of my noble friends <e> <s> but certainly we support the spirit and say that this person ought to be a circuit judge <e>", "<cs> it may not be very good for him <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord is posing questions without limit may i ask him what in his view would happen if somebody was permanently on night shift and his premises could not be searched between six in the evening and six in the morning <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee would allow me to say just one word <e> <s> this again is one of the amendments which were recommended by the law society to which i referred earlier <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his promise to consider this point which is one of great concern to the legal profession <e> <s> i am obliged to him <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies would he kindly take it that i am saying precisely what i said in regard to the last amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister forgive me for one moment <e> <s> one quite understands why there may be an answer to the question please what are immigration officers told <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister tell me is the general tenor of the instructions that immigration officers are to adopt a sympathetic tolerant reaction to these matters and to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords and to the right reverend prelate who participated in this debate <e> <s> my motion called for papers <e> <s> i have an idea that if they were to be delivered they would be so embarrassing to the government that i wish to show the mercy they have not shown in this matter and beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> i wish that everyone could be as pleasing and as witty as the noble and learned lord when dealing with questions <e> <s> it makes it almost a pleasure to withdraw an amendment <e> <s> but perhaps i may just say this to the noble and learned lord it could be that i am on a bad point on the other hand it could be the odd occasion on which i am on a good one <e> <s> in the circumstances i would ask him to be kind enough to consider at least the point that i am now about to make but about which i have no intention of making heavy weather <e> <s> he answered me by saying that there was a definition clause in clause <e> <s> indeed there is but there is no definition there of information <e> <s> the definitions in clause are of data and personal data and with respect it would not make it any more obvious that one is entitled or only entitled to the odd punched holes by merely saying that he is entitled to a copy of the information <e> <s> the information could still be the punched holes <e> <s> what we all want of course is what the noble and learned lord was referring to that is an intelligible translation of the punched holes <e>", "<cs> in the light of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> obviously there are arguments both ways <e> <s> i should like to read what the noble and learned lord has said digest it and see which way the balance appears to me to go then i shall act accordingly <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would bear with me for a moment if i put this to him because i think it may be of interest to other members of the committee <e> <s> of course if the inaccurate information constituted a defamatory statement then the normal rules of libel would apply <e> <s> there are a number of occasions one would have thought where inaccurate information is not defamatory and where it would be very difficult to prove actual damage but where the distress may be very great indeed <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord would allow me and i think that the noble lord lord mottistone would agree with me it would cause him the utmost distress because he would be approached by all the charities that exist in the united kingdom and by many individuals who would ask him to invest in their businesses and so on <e> <s> knowing the noble lord lord mottistone as we do such approaches would cause him the utmost distress <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord would kindly consider possibly altering the words to <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord was kind enough to call me intelligent <e> <s> anybody who does that causes me to give in right away <e> <s> seriously i only want to say this <e> <s> the arguments that the noble and learned lord advanced as well as the examples that he gave are of such weight that i obviously would want to consider this amendment <e> <s> at this stage i should like to ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> indeed i do <e> <s> i hope that the brevity of my remarks did not mask the importance that we ascribe to this amendment <e> <s> we here are the guardians of the people who may be affected by exceptions to this bill <e> <s> anybody who is responsible takes the view that there must be exceptions for the sake of the detection of crime and so on <e> <s> that is admitted <e> <s> but if you grant those exceptions you cannot just leave it to the discretion of the secretary of state as to whether or not he will apply further safeguards by virtue of having added to the exemptions <e>", "<cs> i ought to say that i hope he will be in a fit state at the end of his term of office to join your <e>", "<cs> i will not detain the committee save to say that the reason for amendment no <e> <s> a as against no <e> <s> is that we were told before by the noble lord the minister and quite correctly that you should not give the registrar power to make orders by way of safeguards or anything else because they would not be subject to the will of parliament <e> <s> then if you alter that to the secretary of state in order to meet that argument you are told that it is a wrong power to give to the secretary of state because you are giving him too much power or because parliament cannot negate <e> <s> i think that the quickest and most effective course on what i think is a necessary safeguard for the subject in these exemption clauses is to ask the committee kindly to divide <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord the minister wishes to answer that question and get it out of the way <e>", "<cs> sometimes one endeavours to help the committee and one finds in the end that it may not be of very great assistance <e> <s> one tries to help the committee very often by addressing the committee on several amendments which relate to one clause thereby saving the committee various speeches <e> <s> it can be confusing at times if one does that and i would rather like to make it clear as i thought my noble and learned friend did that although he was speaking to various amendments they are in fact separate amendments and will be taken separately <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may deal very quickly with what seems to me to be the essential matter that we are considering <e> <s> it is as the committee knows clause <e>", "<cs> i take the point of the noble lord the minister but i am afraid that he has not followed through his own argument which relates to subsection and subsection <e> <s> this amendment goes to the root of subsection by virtue of the fact that it is connected with <e> <s> at the present moment if the inland revenue go for collection or assessment purposes be it to banks to accountants or to anybody else who has information on computers the answer is please go away we do not do things like that we do not tell the revenue the confidential information we have got even if it would help as might be thought in the collection or assessment of taxes <e>", "<cs> i can well picture the noble lord the minister writing this out with great care last night having as he said studied every line of it <e> <s> the least i can do in courtesy since he has taken so much trouble i am sure personally writing out those words is to say that certainly i will look at it <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can help the noble lord <e> <s> the point is a simple one that i tried to make <e> <s> it is that one ought to define the nature of the research otherwise so many things can come under this umbrella <e> <s> the noble lord will presumably either agree or disagree with that <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord the minister has said has convinced me that possibly i have the wrong wording here <e> <s> therefore i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but would he consider the main point which is the broad nature of the word research <e> <s> it would be a great privilege for me if we could correspond between now and the report stage and if we could come up with an agreed amendment i am sure that everyone would be happy <e>", "<cs> the attempt was to be merciful <e> <s> the noble lord thinks there is no need for mercy and that it is far more merciful to leave the registrar deciding which should go into what phase by way of applications <e> <s> in view of the expression of opinion by the minister who i suppose has taken advice i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly study what the noble lord said <e> <s> obviously there is much force in the argument he uses and at this stage i ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may one thank him for his very lucid explanation of the money saving factors in the bill but am i not right in thinking that the bill contains no provisions to deal with conciliatory services especially those relating to divorce matters or even encouragement of them in an informal way in the courts <e> <s> apart from the human aspect is this not rather uneconomic in relation to legal costs <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is not being as frank with the committee as we would expect him to be in that reply <e> <s> this is not the first time that your lordships house has considered the case of children and fares and it is not the first time that this house has looked somewhat critically at the decision of another place in regard to children and fares <e> <s> i am inviting if i may say so on behalf of my noble friends all parts of the house to take a careful look at this matter which is not political at all <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> will the minister forgive me and answer one short point <e> <s> is it the intention of the government that every application for a grant made under the plan will be met in full <e> <s> if his answer is that there is no such undertaking that they will all be met in full how can he say that the childrens subsidy is bound to be met in full per cent <e> <s> and that therefore there is no question of that grant suffering <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord the minister merely to utter one sentence and to remind him that when he was indeed dealing line by line with every word of a bill at times he became awfully angry with the government front bench <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer very briefly the helpful contribution that was made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> he was endeavouring to assist the committee as he normally does so well on legal aspects relating to this matter <e> <s> he referred to judicial review and both he and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter referred specifically to benefits as we have them now in the bill being a comprehensive term and therefore any definition limiting the interpretation of benefits <e>", "<cs> i frequently find that members opposite reach a conclusion by a circuitous path <e> <s> at times it is so circuitous that not even they can agree upon the nature of the path <e>", "<cs> what i want to say to the committee quite quickly is this whether it be the question of interpretation on a judicial review referred to by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway or whether it be the point about limitation if you define the matter i frankly say to the committee and i have an idea that this may be the lot of many members if not all of us that i had no knowledge of the document that had been issued by the department of transport <e>", "<cs> i am taking a point of order if it is permitted in your lordships committee which i would normally have taken had i been sitting on the other side <e> <s> this is a most magnificent second reading debate <e> <s> we are dealing at the moment not with whether the transport bill is a proper vehicle or with what the glc did or did not do <e> <s> we are dealing with the definition of benefits and i believe that our business cannot be conducted in this way <e> <s> i say that with great deference sitting where i do <e>", "<cs> i believe that this argument on this amendment can be brought into a very short series of sentences <e> <s> either we are right in saying that local government is being put under a handicap by this clause or we are wrong <e> <s> either we are right in saying that the dignity and the jurisdiction of local government is being infringed or we are wrong <e> <s> the minister says that there is no infringement of dignity or jurisdiction and really no difference in normal local government and national procedures <e> <s> if he is right then this amendment deserves to de defeated <e> <s> if i can satisfy your lordships very shortly that he is wrong then your lordships ought objectively if i may say so to vote for the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether at this stage i can intervene usefully or if not usefully then at least briefly <e> <s> i could understand the minister i would not necessarily agree with him saying that he has and certainly it is in accordance with his tradition a respect for the autonomy of local government if i could find somewhere in the bill a clause which provided that before the plan finally went to the local authority for its endorsement it should go both to the minister the secretary of state and to the local authority and it should be the duty of the executive to take into account the advice of the minister and also the advice of the authority <e> <s> if one saw that in the bill one would say that at least the minister was making a fair point <e> <s> he is making the point that these are only guidelines that the executive need not follow them and that after all it is not the end of the day because it is the authority that has the last word <e> <s> we know in fact what that means it means that they have the last word provided they are prepared to run a risk and a very severe risk if they decide that their word dictates that the transport needs are going to go above the limit <e>", "<cs> i interrupt the minister if he will forgive me for the following reason <e> <s> i beg of him to deal with the point <e> <s> if we are merely talking about guidance and consultation why is there not a clause in the bill which does not just talk about consult with the local authority but uses the words shall take into account the advice of the authority in the same way as the executive has to take into account the advice of the secretary of state <e> <s> if consult equals take into account the advice can we have the same words used for the authority and for the secretary of state because then at least we shall know that there is honesty so far as the government are concerned <e>", "<cs> i am not going to let the minister off the hook if he will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> if i am bidden by the minister in a letter to consult with the minister he knows as well as i do that that means that i express my view he expresses his and i can come to any conclusion that i like <e> <s> if i have a letter from the minister telling me that under an act of parliament i shall have to take into account his advice he knows as well as i do that that goes beyond consulting because i am bidden to take into account his advice before i come to my decision <e> <s> there is a world of difference between the two <e> <s> any judge on a judicial review will recognise the difference between the two <e> <s> indeed it does not take a judge it takes a person of ordinary common sense who knows common english to see the difference between the two <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment because it deals with something we have touched upon and indeed accentuated during this afternoons debates on the various amendments namely the very important matter of the relationship between national and local government <e> <s> i want to revert to that for one moment <e> <s> i regard it as somewhat extraordinary that so many comments should have been made by the noble lord the minister about the desirability of this principle yet when it comes to every amendment which tries to patch up this relationship which is in a very difficult state at the moment let us not have any doubts about that may i quote again from <e>", "<cs> nevertheless it is not such a grave responsibility for him to have to think <e> <s> what i am saying to the noble lord the minister and i am saying it with great sincerity on behalf of my noble friends and myself is this there is an opportunity to build into this enactment a compulsory consultative procedure <e> <s> consultation can be had if you like within limits of time so as not to postpone things indefinitely <e> <s> consultation can take place to use the ministers own phrase without commitment <e> <s> but consultation ought to take place and i am sure that the noble lord the minister will on reflection agree with this because it is written into the bill not as a matter of benevolence and not if you like at the instance of the local authority associations <e> <s> this dignity local authority deserves before the advice is given on the plans and in other ways that are mentioned in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i would not have intervened on what i suppose is really a second reading point had the noble lord the minister and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter not seen fit to make to the committee speeches which attacked and wounded but which did not have sufficient courage to carry through their reasoning to any logical conclusion <e> <s> i assure your lordships committee that were it not for that i would not have intervened <e> <s> but it is an extraordinary <e>", "<cs> may i take the committee down a different path <e> <s> this is not because i do not follow the same path as my noble friends who have already participated in the debate it is because i want to take a different route in recommending the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> i believe that the main reason for this amendment or any similar amendment is not to drive a coach and quite a few horses through the principles of the bill but to try very hard to save the courts from being brought in to decide upon whether or not a local authority has behaved lawfully <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has spoken in terms of this bill clarifying the issue <e> <s> i wonder whether i can best deal with that point by asking your lordships committee to imagine for one moment that you are members of a transport authority <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter sits down may i point out that the committee has been listening to a distinguished member of the bar <e> <s> i am sure that he keeps the traditions of the bar as i do on my side of the profession which is to keep people away from litigation wherever possible and to see whether one cannot achieve an amicable and sensible settlement of differences <e> <s> this is what i together with my noble friends was trying to bring to this debate <e> <s> would the noble lord care to say whether his advice with regard to his previous experience in the treasury is that the secretary of state should take the figure that his civil servants bring to him in respect of these grants and multiply it by three <e>", "<cs> i think it may be appropriate if i address my remarks at this stage namely on the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> if that is not convenient to the noble lord opposite or for any other reason is not a suitable course i shall obviously resume my seat on the slightest hint to that effect <e> <s> clause deals with the enabling powers for a marriage to take place where someone is in prison or is otherwise detained in a hospital or similar establishment <e>", "<cs> may i deal with that point very humbly but only because the noble lord the minister as i said has possibly been caught unaware in regard to this matter <e> <s> i have already said this and he ought to be treated with a proper amount of consideration as a result <e> <s> but i did understand from the second reading speech that was made by the noble minister lord elton that the purpose of this bill among other considerations was to economise on prison officer services <e> <s> we were told that quite a lot of time was taken up with taking prisoners for this purpose to an outside place <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to come back and i promise the committee that this is the very last time <e> <s> i believe that when the noble lord the minister wrote to me he very clearly said and understandably so that the precise address where the solemnization takes place must be there in the notice apart from anything else and in the certificate because otherwise if it is at an address other than the one that is given first there is no right to challenge the propriety of the marriage if i may put it in those terms and secondly there is a question of whether the marriage would not be void in any event if it were not at the address for which the notice was given <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is most grateful as i certainly am to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> may i just explain to him so that he does not think i was inconsiderate that i was engaged on another bill and was waiting for the noble lord lord elton to appear to give him advance notice <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> i hope that the right reverend prelate will not do so without a protest or hoping that something more helpful might emerge from the noble lord the minister than has emerged at this stage <e> <s> it was a harsh brief to which we listened <e> <s> nobody imagines that a prison warder would dress up as a page and i felt that although it might bring a smile to somebodys lips it was not quite the tone that i had hoped the noble lord the minister with his usual kindliness wanted to bring to the discussion of this matter <e>", "<cs> i promise the committee that my observations will be brief <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his kindly reference to my noble friend lord blease whom i know felt very deeply about this matter <e> <s> representations have been made to many of us and i had the privilege of a conference with a representative of the clergy almost immediately after he had seen the noble lord <e> <s> i know that this matter has caused great concern and there was conveyed to me an expression of gratitude for the way in which the government had accepted the representations which have led to the amendments <e>", "<cs> the government are sluggish indeed if i may use that phrase in regard to transport <e> <s> it has been made perfectly clear that public disquiet and public inconvenience will be caused to a tremendous degree if you have a situation of a railway closure with a substituted bus service and you then get a bus closure in regard to the substituted service without mandatory consultation with the transport consultative committee of the area <e>", "<cs> indeed he will try to do so <e> <s> i wonder whether we can combine our thoughts and concentrate on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it is the hope of this committee i believe not to make local authorities the office boys of the secretary of state <e> <s> we have gone a long way to doing so <e> <s> we have said that their plans for transport and they are the transport authorities are made subject to the advice and requests for modification of the secretary of state <e> <s> that deals with questions of social policy and indeed some questions of administration <e> <s> we have said in this bill on the government side it is their clear intention that the finances in regard to transport shall be subject to the dictates of the secretary of state in that there will be a limit set by the secretary of state and if the authority goes beyond that limit and it is empowered to do so it runs the risk of being brought before the courts at the instigation of a ratepayer or any other person who feels aggrieved and can therefore have some sort of right of representation and of being told that the authority has acted illegally with all that flows from that <e>", "<cs> before the minister goes on to another matter would he mind dealing with this point <e> <s> if it is merely an act of courtesy to the authority in case it might have forgotten its powers to have a review why has the minister not included in the clause though one imagines that as a matter of law the secretary of state could do it a provision stating <e>", "<cs> i do not want to set any traps for the noble lord the minister that is the last thing that i should ever do <e> <s> but is he really saying that if at a later stage there was put down an amendment using the word may so that the matter was permissive instead of mandatory the government would as he has just said regard it as being exactly the same and therefore would agree to the amendment <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> upon which despairing note of the minister i rise in order to try to tell him what although we may not have achieved it is the intention of the amendment <e> <s> if i can explain to the minister in the same gentle language as he used to us on this side of the committee what that intention is it may well be that he can accommodate us and that we shall be able to put down at report a proper amendment or have the pleasure of seeing a government amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead is always helpful but he has not if i may say so been as helpful as i and my other noble friends are prepared to be <e> <s> we are not at the moment arguing that the secretary of state should himself have to bear the cost of the review <e> <s> we are in fact saying something that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway caught immediately and i believe it to be true that not only lawyers in your lordships committee are anxious to see that justice is done <e> <s> we are asking for <e>", "<cs> horrified <e>", "<cs> i am not <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> i am a little mystified if i may say so and i am trying awfully hard to equate the provisions of this clause with the way in which efficient business would be carried on in a private company <e> <s> i think possibly noble lords opposite would regard that as a fair way of assessing the value of an efficiency clause <e> <s> i can understand the government saying if it is what they wish to say that from time to time it is a very good idea to find out what you are paying for an activity carried on within your organisation what it costs you one should find out what it costs somebody else and compare the two <e> <s> then possibly if the two do not equate and there is a very substantial difference it might be decided that there is something wrong with the executives organisation and that it ought to put it right <e> <s> i understand that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister in order to clairfy at least one humble mind on your lordships committee would answer this question <e> <s> is it the intention of the government to leave the discretion completely i am sure that he meant what he was saying in all candour with the executive as to whether having regard to all the social and other factors efficiency may not be properly answered by accepting the tender which is obtained by the executive or is it within the purview of the secretary of state to say i disagree with the authority and with the executive in not having accepted that tender <e> <s> i do not like their arguments on efficiency or social advantage in refusing it and therefore when it comes to fixing my limit i shall fix a limit which will take into account what it would have cost if only that tender had been accepted <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord <e> <s> lord campbell of alloway did not think me discourteous when i failed to rise again <e> <s> i thought that he was supporting me if my construction was right <e> <s> if that was so i was really waiting for the noble lord the minister to reply and say whether my construction was right or wrong <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is most courteous but i am afraid that he has not understood my point <e> <s> it may very well be that it is my fault for not having put it clearly enough <e> <s> may i put it to him i hope a little more clearly in these circumstances <e> <s> i appreciate that it is within the discretion of the executive to decide what activities should in fact be made the subject of the tender procedure <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> the minister has said it and repeated it and it is within the section <e> <s> the question i asked of him was this are we to take it also that it lies within the discretion of the executive on matters of efficiency and cost and so on to make the decision for itself as to whether or not having received various tenders it accepts any one of them in respect of those activities <e> <s> the minister nods his head and says yes <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one or two short sentences to what has been said <e> <s> i ask the minister kindly to consider the following point which has not yet been advanced except by my noble friend who has just spoken about this being a usual clause by way of protection <e> <s> in my submission the reason for putting it in is that you wish to avoid embarrassment as an authority because you have a particularly persistent tenderer who says i happen to know that my figure was the lowest tender <e> <s> i happen to know that under the act you are instructed to accept the lowest tender provided that the tenderer is satisfactory <e> <s> where am i unsatisfactory <e> <s> i demand to know this because otherwise you are not carrying out your duty under the act and you must have some reason for saying that i am unsatisfactory <e> <s> it is a good thing that the authority concerned is able to say ah we are not under a duty to accept necessarily the lowest tender <e> <s> if you look at the act you will see that that is so <e> <s> that may get the authority out of the very embarrassing position of having to argue that the contractor who is tendering is not indeed able to supply a satisfactory service <e> <s> therefore it can do no harm but only good <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few brief comments in regard to this clause <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has concentrated all his fire on answering the various amendments that have been moved on the principle that unless the tender happens to be satisfactory and an economically sensible tender the executive can refuse it <e> <s> of necessity that means if you turn the coin over that if it is satisfactory in regard to an activity and it is at a lower cost than the activity which is being carried out then it is the duty of the executive to accept it <e>", "<cs> i wish it were a complex matter and i wish that as a result of it being so complex one could accept with satisfaction the ministers answer <e> <s> it is a simple and important matter <e> <s> up to the moment of the repeal of section an authority could lawfully and without fear of being challenged exercise a statutory power and tell the executive to carry out a loss-making but nevertheless essential social exercise provided of course that the authority paid for it <e> <s> that is perfectly just and acceptable <e>", "<cs> may i help the noble lord lord campbell of alloway because he very often is kind enough to help me <e> <s> as i understand it the relevance of this provision to the bill is that there are certain concessions which do not come within the budget which will be considered for the upper limit the lawful upper limit as we have called it in some of our speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid we are taking a very unrealistic view of the future in regard to computers and the provisions of the bill if we really feel that we can leave it on the basis that a registrar will be appointed independent as we know he will be to carry out all the functions that could be envisaged <e> <s> i have said before and in saying it again i had better say it briefly having earned a certain reputation with your lordships this afternoon that he is not to be surely the same type of registrar as the registrar of companies or the registrar of business names as they used to be <e> <s> the onus put upon this registrar and upon the secretary of state in some matters is too heavy by far for any one individual <e> <s> lindop saw that and the white paper saw that <e> <s> therefore in both documents there was a recommendation that there should be an advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by the noble lord the minister is a perfectly fair one <e> <s> i meet it only in this way <e> <s> it is perfectly open for the noble lord the minister having promised to reconsider this matter without any commitment at committee stage to do what i believe your lordships would want him to do namely if there is a case for the advisory committee not only to advise the secretary of state on the limited matters which may be set out in the amendment and in amendment no <e> <s> but also to advise the registrar on the many matters upon which expert advice is called for then the noble lord the minister has only to say so and it will stop us having to divide on what we regard to be a principle <e> <s> if the noble lord cannot concede that point then quite obviously we regard this advisory committee as being so important for the larger series of powers and objects that may be set down in this immediate amendment that we would want to test the views of the house upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would kindly make this observation if he wishes to do so in view of his reference to the opposition in another place <e> <s> did he carefully study the speeches that were made from the opposition benches that decried terrorism went into the history of the matter and felt that honest doubts had upon that occasion to be expressed <e> <s> does he not acknowledge that there are at least two points of view when civil liberties are at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords before we commence our deliberations may i ask whether we can be protected against our own data <e> <s> if your lordships will look at the second marshalled list you will see that it is headed second marshalled list of amendments to be moved in committee <e> <s> they are of course to be moved at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords that only means that this bill is back to front and i have always said so <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches definitely support the principle behind this amendment and have listened with rapt attention and expectation to the remarks of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords reckless is the member of your lordships house who did not take into account anything that fell from those learned lips <e> <s> it may very well be that i am on a wrong tack but i should like merely to amplify what i said before <e> <s> however i shall do so very briefly in order that the noble and learned lord may be quite sure that he has covered in his very explicit reply the point that i was really trying to make however inadequately <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with all of your lordships i am getting mixed up with data user and data subject <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for his correction <e> <s> i of course mean the data subject and i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> what i was trying to do was to ensure that where as in most cases the registrar would have investigated a complaint in regard to inaccuracy in regard to wrongful disclosure then instead of having to go through all of the motions again when going to the court for compensation i should have hoped that at least there was <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the slightest hesitation in view of the courteous and helpful remarks of the noble and learned lord in begging leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister need not apologise in the slightest for the length of his address to your lordships upon these two amendments now brought forward by the government <e> <s> indeed they deal with important points for which we on this side have the support of certain members of your lordships house who do not have the privilege of sitting on our benches <e> <s> this was something for which we fought hard <e> <s> it is a measure of the ministers breadth of mind if i may say so that after the consideration which he promised he has taken these points on board and has brought forward these amendments <e>", "<cs> i support this constructive and useful amendment my lords <e> <s> it follows in many ways a recommendation considered carefully and made in the lindop report <e> <s> mothers have often learned from their children as well as children learning from their mothers <e> <s> i think that the mother country could possibly learn from the child dominion of new zealand in this connection <e> <s> from an informant much more learned than i in these matters i learnt today that new zealand has a privacy commissioner <e> <s> the post was set up under an act in new zealand <e> <s> if a person finds that every application that he makes for a job is failing and he has an idea that some inaccurate information about him is being disseminated from a computer or in some other way he can go to the privacy commissioner <e> <s> the commissioner will note the complaint make his own inquiries and then do exactly what the noble lord lord mottistone said <e> <s> he will come back to the person and tell him i am not going to tell you what i have found but in my view you have nothing to worry about <e> <s> that is the end of the matter <e> <s> i should have thought that that would be a very valuable piece of assistance that could be given in the context of the bill before us <e> <s> therefore we on these benches support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether with his usual courtesy the noble lord the minister will allow me to intervene since we are on a very important matter and i am unable to speak again other than by jumping up in this way <e> <s> as i see it in the subsection of the amendment to which the noble lord the minister was referring there are two points which seem immediately to upset his arguments <e> <s> since i must be wrong in thinking that his arguments are upset i should be delighted if he would deal with the matter <e> <s> first all that is stated in subsection is that the registrar must be satisfied that there is a <e>", "<cs> read on <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment which was so eloquently moved by my noble and learned friend may i refer to something that the noble lord the minister said at committee stage when this very matter was discussed <e> <s> i am referring to column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> he appears to be going on to another subject and leaving that of the european convention and his interpretation of those words <e> <s> i did very courteously ask certain questions which my noble and learned friend repeated <e> <s> the questions were as follows has the question of immigration control related to the provisions of data protection been referred to the european community in any one of its divisions to obtain its opinion <e> <s> if so what was that opinion <e> <s> if not why not <e> <s> and is the minister not prepared to put that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has suggested that certain things have escaped my notice <e> <s> if they had done that would not be an exception to a general rule it would be the general rule i am sure <e> <s> but he is not justified in this particular instance <e> <s> i am not going to press this amendment but what i am going to do since this bill is going to another place and i suppose there is an opportunity at third reading to reconsider is to look briefly at what the noble lord the minister has said where one is trying to interpret rights under clause <e> <s> at <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i should like to bring to a head what in my submission is the essential matter before your lordships <e> <s> in the main there are two considerations <e> <s> first this is a question of voluntary disclosure and all that we have in the clause is that the person who discloses matters which are confidential has a complete defence if he has a reasonable belief in thinking that one of the matters mentioned in the clause would be prejudiced <e> <s> i am thinking of prosecution the prevention of crime and so on <e> <s> the consideration of your lordships is <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister permit me to interrupt <e> <s> i dealt with the voluntary nature of the disclosure and asked the noble lord the minister how he could possibly justify a voluntary disclosure when the register does not contain and the data subject has been led into the belief that it is all all right if he gives the information a warning that disclosure may in certain circumstances be made of that information <e> <s> as he knows this was called by the lindop committee a palpable fraud on the public <e> <s> it is a responsible committee <e> <s> how does the noble lord answer that charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord drumalbyn always puts a case very effectively <e> <s> if i may say so on this occasion i wonder whether he realises unless i am wrong that there is a door that he has left open <e> <s> we are dealing with personal data here <e> <s> let us take it for granted that you merely have names and addresses of people and they could include the name of the noble lord lord elton the name of the noble lord lord drumalbyn or my own who were accustomed to play truant at school <e> <s> i am giving an amusing example i hope but of course the examples could be such that they are not amusing <e>", "<cs> my lords i acquit the noble lord the minister of any discourtesy that would be the last thing he could ever be accused of <e> <s> but i confess that i am still unhappy that the word research has no definition because we can all imagine types of research which all of us would wish to be caught by this bill <e> <s> i could do no more than put down the amendment with words that i realised even when putting them down would not satisfy your lordshps or the noble lord the minister <e> <s> but i do beg of him to consider the principle involved and to see whether with the expert guidance that he has and which is not available to me he can think of some way of dealing with the problem which i think still exists <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i detected and colleagues in the law will recognise what i am saying a <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with respect to what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> as often is the case time will see whether he is right or the forecast of some chaos is right <e> <s> he is one who must accept responsibility at this stage for the administrative sense of the bill <e> <s> therefore there is no point in my continuing that fight <e> <s> i have said my little piece and that must be that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down to save the house from being wearied by another speech from me would he kindly answer the direct question which i put to him <e> <s> it is this is it correct or not that under the provisions of the bill as they now are the registrar can find on an application contravention of every one of the principles set out in the schedule <e> <s> is it right that if he finds that he can do nothing as against the user nothing at all for a period of two years <e> <s> if that is right i ask the minister to say so because then we have to revert to this matter on third reading <e> <s> i think many members of your lordships house would be horrified to know it <e>", "<cs> my lords with a heavy heart and a somewhat light head at this hour i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords those words were very generous and i want to take advantage of them <e> <s> in view of the noble lords reply i will merely add that it is an odd situation when such inaccuracies remain in perpetuity <e> <s> i repeat that of course if a generous time were given to the data user i am sure we would all agree that that was the proper balance <e> <s> it is an odd situation when something gives a data subject a right if it happens to have been recorded against him and is inaccurate in july or whenever the date may be but if by some extraordinary circumstance it happens to have been recorded a few months before that date he can do nothing about it <e> <s> it is an extraordinary situation and one that cannot be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one quarrel at the outset with my noble friend lord underhill a most unusual event

being emotional and i resent the fact that the ministers charge was taken away from me and adopted by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> it is perfectly proper to be emotional about this matter without overdoing it <e> <s> your lordships are never happy recipients of over-indulged emotionalism <e> <s> but if it is accompanied by common sense your lordships regardless of party are usually

<e> <s> this aspect is so important that i make no apology for intervening but merely thank the noble lord for his courtesy in allowing me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me is he quite conscious of his words a harder and harsher mind <e> <s> does he wish that to be the attitude of the front bench in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately make that comment with all deference because the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes never rises to her feet unless she has something sensible to say but i am afraid this occasion was a rare exception to that rule <e> <s>

addresses on this subject and the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has followed the same line we have been told that this bill is one that in no way interferes with the dignity rights and prerogatives of the authority and that there is a simple programme of procedural events and the minister has just gone through them where the last word is that of the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords so far the noble lord is very kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has been most thoughtful in regard to the convenience of this house <e> <s> from these benches we certainly support the amendments he so lucidly explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have my name associated with that of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> on one side indeed i might term this a holy alliance

view support for the principle that it was wrong for the bill at all events to give the appearance of setting down a new procedure because new procedure it would be by which prisoners would only have their marriages celebrated in prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down i wonder whether i may be allowed to express my personal gratitude to the noble lord the minister as so eloquently expressed by the right reverend prelate for all the consideration that has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be reassured by having the undertaking of the noble lord the minister that the present secretary of state is reasonable and will always act reasonably <e> <s> may i give him a similar assurance from this front bench that my noble friend lord underhill is a very reasonable man and i hope that your lordships will similarly think of me <e> <s> we are not really in the process of defining whether any particular secretary of state or any member of your lordships house has the distinct quality of being reasonable <e> <s> this is a mandatory requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down this is my only way of answering the question which he very courteously put to me is the noble lord seriously suggesting to the house usually he is a serious member of your lordships house and when he fails to be serious he is even more attractive than when he is serious that when a local executive wants <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it will be useful if in answer to the noble lord who asks whether this is merely a

about this matter <e> <s> because i do not have <e>", "<cs> my lords if we cannot have hypothetical answers to hypothetical questions perhaps we can i suggest to your lordships have a straight answer

<s> the minister has not risen so i take it for granted that so far he agrees with what i have said <e> <s> if it is necessary or essential for the executive to have information from the nbc in order to prepare its plan the minister answers this amendment by saying that it is already provided for <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i rise with pleading in my voice sorrow in my heart and a prophetic expectation of the reply that i shall receive and it all makes me very miserable <e> <s> i tried to listen to the noble lords reply with the courtesy with which i know the minister listened to my noble friend lord underhill <e> <s> are the government so complete in wisdom that they can imagine that there is nothing to which an authority would want to have particular regard other than the matters that they have mentioned <e> <s> are they really saying with their hand on their hearts that an authority will be put into some doubt as to what it can do if it is told that it must have particular regard to these two items but it could indeed have particular regard to another item <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister will remember that this is not a discussion with the department

of this bill and i challenge the noble lord to say that i am wrong and to give me reasons for it he has to say if it happens to be the lowest tender that it is that the tenderer is unsatisfactory <e> <s> the executive without these words is left naked before the tenderer a most unseemly position as i am sure your lordships will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord for the way in which this bill has gone through its various stages up till this one in your lordships house <e> <s> i personally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we need not apologise to ourselves even if the hour be rather late that once again we are debating conditions in our prisons <e> <s> i say that because without any doubt at all this is a matter of great concern to parliament and to the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords if one michael fagan had not most wrongfully intruded into buckingham palace in june and july last year i wonder whether this bill would be before your lordships today with an invitation that it should be given a second reading <e> <s> but it is absolutely true that when that event occurred the public was aghast and worried <e> <s> indeed it came as a great surprise to many people including some lawyers that no criminal offence had been committed when somebody had wrongfully trespassed into a residence unless the intent of the entry was to commit a criminal offence or unless in some way it was associated with the perpetration of a criminal offence or an act of some violence <e> <s> i can well understand therefore why this house and the nation at large should be very much interested in the matters that are being debated this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for asking me to do that <e> <s> i am reading from page paragraphs and <e> <s> the document continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord would want to be fair to the point that i made <e> <s> i said how welcome it would have been if there had been an unstarred question or the gamble had been taken of a short debate <e> <s> my point was that it is not usual to bring a bill before the house during a consultation period <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble earl only for one purpose <e> <s> sitting behind the right reverend prelate as he is is he quite sure that he is correctly using the word metaphysical <e>", "<cs> my lords in the language of satire which is not usually the sign of strength the noble lord the minister talked in terms of these duties being similar to the ten commandments being written outside the registrars office <e> <s> when the almighty issued the ten commandments there was no doubt about his right to do so <e> <s> the difficulty that we are faced with in this connection is that the registrar has not yet been appointed <e> <s> we have no power no right and no privilege of seeing him and interviewing him in this house at this moment i have an idea that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is making a witty intervention <e>", "<cs> not a bit my lords <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has no need to apologise he lightens the atmosphere of this house so often <e> <s> i have an idea that he brought in moses <e> <s> if he did i can only say that i believe i am right in pointing out that moses had no right to break the ten commandments and shatter them in pieces <e> <s> therefore no right exists with the noble lord the minister to deal with the amendment in the same way as he seeks to deal with it this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have heard that reply delivered with the same amount of courtesy as vagueness <e> <s> to say that we have been debating the general power and so on is surely not to answer the straight question please where is the power to investigate which the noble lord the minister expressly said was written in this bill <e> <s> we cannot be referred to a debate in your lordships house <e> <s> we want to see it in the bill if that is where the minister says it is <e> <s> a message is about to reach him which may enable me to sit down again and the minister to rise again <e>", "<cs> my lords so much is implicit in what the noble lord says in regard to this bill and this amendment and so little is explicit that i think your lordships will be grateful to those including the consumer council who wish everything to be explicit in this innovation as i said in our legislation and in the creation of the registrar <e> <s> i do not think that i can usefully add anything to this <e>", "<cs> my lords this is typical it is typical of this bill <e> <s> if i may say so in all humility i am scared about what we are doing <e> <s> there is no question of a select committee taking evidence here and all of us trying to become experts on data computers and so on <e> <s> let us look at the very clause that the noble lord the minister has referred us to <e> <s> your lordships will be amazed to find that this is the clause which deals with an application being made to a circuit judge in order that the circuit judge may if he thinks it justified issue a warrant for search <e> <s> how in the name of heavens can that be interpreted to be a power of the registrar himself to investigate <e> <s> this is the ultimate power of the registrar when he finds that everything else has failed on investigation he needs some urgent documents he thinks that he cannot get them and he applies under this clause to a circuit judge <e> <s> this is not the normal power to investigate <e> <s> this is what we are <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms the answer is yes <e> <s> quite obviously if flippant applications were made for the use of the powers the registrar and one knows this is quite entitled to say i do not think that this comes within my duty because this is a flippant application and i do not intend therefore to carry out my duty in this connection because it is no duty at all <e> <s> so what we really have is the registrars right to act <e> <s> if you cast a general duty upon him in the terms of this amendment then he knows that he has a right to act and he also knows that in a proper case he has a duty to act <e>", "<cs> my lords we have wandered in our similes and metaphors from moses walking up mount sinai to get the ten commandments to dogs that are chained in kennels in a way that would horrify the noble lord who generally occupies the bench to my left in your lordships chamber <e> <s> i am really wondering where we are getting <e> <s> we are not looking upon the data user as being of any canine quality we are looking upon him as being a respectable citizen who is entitled to look at a bill and see what his rights and duties are under that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord the minister refers to my honourable friends in another place i am sure that he appreciates that this is a nonpolitical amendment and indeed is sponsored by the law society among others <e> <s> i was very glad to hear what the noble lord the minister said <e> <s> i can well understand that there are complexities in drafting <e> <s> in view of his assurance and i believe that i can correctly define it as an undertaking i am perfectly happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that third reading is meant to be the stage of a bill where arguments take place about drafting and words <e> <s> the noble lord the minister must forgive me for saying that if i had wanted to do so i could have answered him at some length but i feel that having put on record the reason for the amendment again it may be looked at between now and the time when it goes to another place and perhaps looked at in another place <e> <s> in those circumstances but in no way admitting that this wording is not far better than that now existing i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a weak answer it is an inconclusive answer and were it not for the fact that the minister was so charming i would say that it was a very wrong answer <e> <s> he should not have made that answer and i say that for this reason <e> <s> if the house is frankly to deal with this matter it must be satisfied and the noble lord lord mottistone interpreted my remarks absolutely correctly that we have excepted security here and are now on the entirely different matters of the four categories in clause <e> <s> somebody cannot just say i take the view that one of these items will be prejudiced and that will be the end of the matter and the data subject will have no rights at all <e> <s> somebody has to supervise it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down since everything is so clear to the minister i have one simple request to make of him <e> <s> on an application by a data subject regarding matters where exemption has been claimed under clause because they are likely to prejudice any one of those four categories could the noble lord kindly point to the words in the bill which give to the court the power to examine the question of prejudice <e> <s> if the noble lord reads those words to your lordships i shall sit down and will even hope to be polite enough to apologise for wasting the time of your lordships <e> <s> if the noble lord does not do so but instead talks in terms of inference then i must ask him since this must be ambiguous if it is purely an inference to give the house the reason why the actual words should not plainly be written into the bill <e> <s> if the inference is there what is the harm if the actual words are used so that everybody can know what their rights are and so that the courts can know it too <e> <s> i sit down and invite the minister to do that <e>", "<cs> and with the leave of the house my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down those are the words which i quoted <e> <s> the words do not bar the argument by any advocate that the court has to be satisfied that the data user the ministry as it most likely will be has not wrongfully used clause because the department in its wisdom has decided that one of the four categories will be prejudiced <e> <s> the court is not given the power expressly to look behind that provision <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister says that it is and that this is what he intends it to have i ask him again why can it not be expressed so that everybody knows it <e>", "<cs> my lords i still do not know why the poor data subject in these circumstances should not be told frankly that there is a risk of disclosure and that his consent should not in fact be full <e> <s> i therefore feel that this amendment is a sensible one <e> <s> however again i do not think it is right on third reading to persist in an amendment of this kind <e> <s> the point has been registered and the noble lord was gracious enough to try to meet it on the last occasion <e> <s> perhaps it will be looked at in another place with a more searching eye than we have used on this occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister forgive me if i charge him in all sincerity with the gravest inconsistency <e> <s> we have been told in answer to earlier amendments that one really ought not to spell everything out in a bill <e> <s> the registrar is an intelligent person and the registrar we were told will know what his duties are without having to be told them in the bill <e> <s> the registrar will obviously know what his powers are without them necessarily being spelled out <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> it is interesting to hear him at this stage on the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> it would have been a great pleasure to have heard him and his noble friends moving their amendments in regard to the bill and participating in the debates <e> <s> a voice at this stage is not all that useful <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has been privileged to hear a weighty speech from a weighty speaker in the form of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> let me at once emphasise in view of the joviality of the noble lord that i was referring to his mental capacity and not to his physical capacity <e> <s> he took the trouble to deliver such a weighty speech upon a bill which he thought was not weighty in content and i have the idea that he thought that some of the things that he had to say to the house always matters which are worthy of consideration were of weighty importance <e> <s> indeed they were <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would agree with me that of the votes cast which he sought to give as an example less than per cent <e> <s> were present in the chamber to hear the argument <e> <s> therefore what can he possibly deduce from that except that somebody has whipped the government supporters to vote in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister accept that whatever may be the increase or decrease in other rates his own rate of cynicism <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not one of the great traditions of this country that whether or not we agree with what demonstrators are demonstrating about if they are doing it peacefully and lawfully it is one of the great rights that they have here a right which is not enjoyed in other countries that we criticise <e> <s> therefore is there not existent within our tradition the right for people who demonstrate peacefully to be protected by the police if that be necessary at public cost <e> <s> and if they offend against the law is not the right of prosecution there and should it not be pursued <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what is left of the house will be most grateful to the noble lord the minister for the clear way in which he has explained this order to us <e> <s> it comes by virtue of the powers in a very important act the misuse of drugs act and also it is directly connected with international conventions into which we have entered <e> <s> i took the trouble to communicate with the pharmaceutical society as to whether there was any point at all that they would wish to have brought to your lordships attention <e> <s> as has been properly said they are perfectly content that these narcotic analgesic drugs should be controlled under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord the minister has the act in front of him and if he will kindly look at page which is the schedule referred to in the order i am sure he will not find a paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful but if that be so and only so that there is clarity in the future it is not helpful to your lordships house to have a reference to schedule to the misuse of drugs act which says shall be amended as follows and to have a reference to a paragraph which is presumably brought in by an amending order to which no reference is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords with a lightness of touch and without too much of a sense of pathos the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has moved your lordships from the problems of the third world to the problems of the bingo world <e> <s> because it is a world with which i am not too familiar i too in order to judge the merits of the bill which the noble lord has presented to the house for a second reading referred to the report of the gaming board for to which the noble lord made very adequate reference <e> <s> i shall not repeat the paragraphs he quoted to your lordships <e> <s> they showed without any doubt that there has been a decrease in the bingo industry and in the number of people who attend bingo clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time will your lordships be grateful from whatever portion of the house the tribute comes to the noble baroness lady faithfull for raising a matter of which she has such great knowledge in the fields of welfare and the relief of distress <e> <s> on a friday morning on which the sun seems to percolate somewhat feebly nevertheless apparently through your lordships house it is perhaps not an original remark to make that the noble baroness is possibly the most aptly named in your lordships house because she has indeed been so loyal and faithful to the causes to which she has devoted so much of her life <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the right reverend prelate will allow me to correct a misunderstanding he is apparently under about one part of my speech <e> <s> i tried to make it perfectly clear that i thought the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord the minister cannot get away with that very short sharp sentence <e> <s> are we to understand that in spite of what he says this other bill which is in the other place is in fact favoured by the government <e> <s> if it is there are many of us who will feel very angry especially at that short reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord accepts the pain and is prepared to suffer it for the sake of justice and for the sake of clarity in this house <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has just expressed the principle a very clear principle that it would deter people who might be wishing to make charitable gifts or indeed legacies in their wills by the fact that their purpose may be frustrated <e> <s> there is another bill in another place which does frustrate that object by making it a fact that such trusts come to an end <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister say whether in his discursion into this matter he feels that that is consistent with what he has just said <e> <s> if he feels that that object is inconsistent may we take it for granted that the government are consistent in their view and will oppose the other bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might extend this point <e> <s> i am sure that the house does not wish to waste its time or that of a select committee of your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord the minister expressed a point of view of principle and then said that he was now on another principle that of compulsion or voluntary act <e> <s> i am assuming as i believe others of your lordships are assuming that the origional settler or testator is now dead and therefore cannot be consulted and therefore cannot be said to be doing something voluntarily <e> <s> he has a succession of trustees and they of course could under the other bill cause his charitable trust to cease and be frustrated <e> <s> that is not from the point of view of the original settler or testator a voluntary act because he is in another place whether higher or lower where his consent cannot be given <e>", "<cs> my lords in the battle against thieves robbers pirates and the mafia phrases which have been rightly used by my noble friend this house will be united <e> <s> i cannot imagine any noble lord deciding to take the part of anyone who deserved that description <e> <s> there is no doubt that not only is there a threat but that thieving robbing pirating and mafia activities are going on in an industry which is vital to this country and which your lordships would wish to encourage that of the creation and practice of art whatever form it might take <e> <s> therefore i join those noble lords who have already spoken in expressing gratitude to my noble friend lord willis for bringing this very important matter to your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that some judges like some noble ministers have very long briefs and very long judgments and that sometimes it is usual especially at this hour to abbreviate them <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for having brought this short bill before the house and for having explained its purpose so clearly <e> <s> your lordships will have realised that something must have been overlooked by parliament when it came to deal with the legislation on lotteries <e> <s> because i felt that it was incumbent upon me to do a little research work to see how this error occurred i found something which may lighten your lordships hearts on a day when very serious announcements have been made <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl the minister care to confirm to the country that his forecast is that every five years the cost of living will be doubled and therefore the rent will have to be doubled every five years <e> <s> is that the message of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be indebted to both the noble lord lord renton and the noble baroness lady faithfull for their contributions in regard to this bill which has come to us from the other place <e> <s> when we were discussing the bill brought forward with such eloquence by the noble baroness lady faithfull i think the house felt that we were dealing with a very complex issue in regard to parochial trusts and the whole question of their being converted into neighbourhood trusts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord denham acclaims the contribution that has just been made by the noble lord lord renton i had better refer the noble lord lord renton to a debate which took place in your lordships house on the question of opticians and their monopoly and the examination of eyes because i have before me in the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am always gracious and i should have thought that the noble lord lord denham in the circumstances of this case would have paid tribute to the gracious way in which i tried to deal with a certain situation <e> <s> i am equally surprised that he did not in fact pay that tribute in view of what has transpired <e> <s> having said that i hope that the discussion upon procedure and tradition and what happened in another place can be terminated and i turn i promise very briefly to the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to interrupt the noble lord perhaps i should warn him that if he continues on that course he may be accused of being ungracious to the government <e> <s> i was so accused although i was speaking just as courteously as the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for the lucid manner in which he has introduced an important measure <e> <s> i find myself in a somewhat original and unique position standing up at this dispatch box because while agreeing fully with my noble friends who have protested at the speed with which bills have been brought before your lordships today with an expedition remarkable in its intensity and yet somewhat dangerous in its complexities i find myself welcoming the fact that this bill has been dealt with speedily <e> <s> without any doubt at all it deals with an evil which is a threat to great industries in this country to the employees in those industries and is a measure that ought to be passed by the house

clear that the last thing i would do would be to try and seek protection in a clear and emphatic way which we all hope is not necessary for privileged documents and in fact in doing so protect the robbers we have been talking about in the house tonight <e> <s> i have no wish on behalf of my noble friends to delay this legislation <e> <s> it is unfortunate that we could not discuss the matter at

with envy upon the noble baroness lady faithful she delivered a speech in regard to this bill on th may this year <e> <s> it was a very good speech if i may be allowed to say so <e> <s> she appears before this house again saying as she was entitled to forecast that those who heard that speech would be more than prepared to hear it again <e> <s> those of your lordships including myself who heard that speech largely made again heard it with pleasure <e> <s> i do not have any illusions that your lordships are prepared to extend the same tolerance to me <e> <s> i followed the noble baroness on

latitude i should like to say a few words on behalf of those on the benches upon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has spoken with his usual modesty in two directions <e> <s> first he has ascribed the bill to sir angus maude as i hope i also did <e> <s> secondly with his usual modesty he has made the bill a small charities bill and not just a charities bill <e> <s> i recognise that at once <e> <s> i know that your lordships will listen to the second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me but it may be of help on the point he is making to get this on to the record <e> <s> is he aware that it takes months not weeks for an application for registration of a charity to be sanctioned by the charity commissioners or even indeed for them to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble lord only so that he can continue as he always likes to do with correct facts before him <e> <s> maybe he is arguing now as to why we should have a bill debated again in a new session because this bill provides not that the local councils furnish lists but that the charity commissioners furnish lists to the councils <e> <s> so that cannot possibly he the cost

those who have to plead for your lordships tolerance since as i am winding up for the opposition on the second reading on this occasion some of your lordships may remember possibly not with infinite pleasure that i similarly wound up for the opposition on the second reading when the bill came before your lordships previously <e>", "<cs> my lords my powers of arithmetic are extremely feeble <e>

the two clauses which the noble and learned lord has with such skill and clarity joined together should not by any member of this front bench be put asunder <e> <s> in that pious resolve i am authorised to say my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones concurs <e> <s> from that brief statement it will be seen that in principle the second reading of this bill will certainly not be opposed from this side of the house <e> <s> but there are certain matters for doubt certain questions which arise in regard to the bill which i venture to put forward before your lordships so that the noble and learned lord with his usual great capacity can deal with them if he so wishes in his answering speech this afternoon or possibly in his later consideration of the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords this again roughly translated which my noble and learned friend i am sure was about to do for me means no right of action stems from a wicked cause <e> <s> these maxims so beloved of lawyers sometimes

workmans injury case <e> <s> said one of the learned lord justices has your client never heard of the maxim <e>", "<cs> my lords the hope expressed by the noble lord lord renton in his last sentence

necessary on every occasion <e> <s> i do not think that this would be the time and place to say where it is necessary or where not but i should hate the house to think that this is necessary on every occasion because it would be completely impossible to manage a trust properly if one had to wait a very long time <e> <s> when i referred on the previous occasion to the very long time one had to wait

of study <e> <s> i owe him that courtesy <e> <s> therefore with the committees leave i shall see what he said <e> <s> i shall read it very carefully and in the meantime ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it looks as though the cricket metaphor is to be continued throughout the whole of the day and it may enable your lordships to smile once or twice in the midst of examining this rather difficult bill <e> <s> so if i may be allowed to continue the metaphor i would say that i feel quite complimented that in view of the point that was raised last time the government should have seen fit to have chatted about this aspect in the changing room to see whether one ought to improve the clause <e> <s> i fear that when they came out possibly bad light stopped play because i do not think that they have seen very clearly what was involved here <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i would say that i have looked at the scoring board and have decided to ask your lordships for leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is a most undesirable procedure if somebody in your lordships house says that he is not going to make a speech and then makes one <e> <s> i promise not to fall into that error <e> <s> the point and i am restricting myself to one sentence that i knew the noble lord the minister would take is that word processors in dealing with words can obviously include words which indentify data subjects and so on <e> <s> the noble lord has taken that to mean for example the addressee of the letter <e> <s> i will study what the noble lord has said in connection with amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> in the meantime <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it is appropriate in the debate on the question whether the clause shall stand part to deal with a matter which is of great concern to many in your lordships committee and certainly to various organisations outside it <e> <s> it is a matter that has been dealt with in other european countries but we are failing to deal with it <e> <s> i mention the matter during the debate on clause stand part because obviously that is the clause that contains definitions and limits the scope of the bill <e> <s> i will not take your lordships away from the consideration of other amendments for too long but i must point out that this bill and this clause and its definitions are tinkering with the law of privacy and doing so in a completely illogical manner <e> <s> the definitions in the clause which limit your lordships consideration to data which merely go through a computer and which leave completely uncovered all manual records and hybrid records which consist of both computer records and manual records make this bill something which is supposed to protect the subject but which really does not do so at all <e>", "<cs> the minister is quite right <e> <s> he dangles a bait and i like a poor fish rise to it <e> <s> but i must rise to it because i am not talking about private diaries <e> <s> i make two points rapidly so that the noble lord can deal with it if he so wishes <e> <s> the first one is that in the past we have not had any legislation in regard to the law of privacy relating to records and the right of people to know what is being recorded about them <e> <s> now we have and we have done it in a piecemeal fashion so that that which is holy is manual and one cannot touch it and that which is unholy and one can search into it is computerised <e>", "<cs> i would not attempt to stop the noble lord lord winstanley from taking any action he deemed expedient but only because of the morbid note he introduced into this debate in referring to what might happen to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> but we all hope that it will not happen for a very long time <e> <s> what occurs to me is what would happen in the case of computerised details prepared by a publishing house for the purpose of producing obituary notices <e> <s> would the data subject be entitled to inquire of <e>", "<cs> i would only say to the noble lord lord winstanley that by virtue of his profession he must have forecast the deaths of many people quite apart from the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i think we shall be fated to get nowhere on this very important amendment if we try to spell out at this stage what ought to go in by way of terms of reference for the advisory committee and what ought not to go in <e> <s> if i may respectfully say so i believe the committee would be well advised to concentrate on the principle otherwise we shall lose the tree which is a very valuable tree because people are quarreling about the branches <e> <s> we can obviously deal with the branches on report or elsewhere <e> <s> the essential thing to get over is the necessity to have an advisory committee otherwise the noble lords reply will be a very obvious one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord digby has reached with this amendment a very important part of the bill and it deserves some concentration before we adjourn for other purposes <e> <s> when a committee is set up consisting of renowned people who concentrate their attention upon the problems of data protection for a very long period of time it would be disappointing for them to find that some of their major important recommendations were not accepted when legislation was brought forward upon the matter upon which they sat and upon which they were to guide <e> <s> of course nobody pretends that when a government committee is set up the government have to accept all the committees recommendations but i think that the onus is upon the government and very much so to say why it is that the recommendations have not been accepted <e> <s> there cannot be the slightest doubt but that the lindop committee made a very strong and reasoned recommendation that codes of practice should be encouraged should be created and should have statutory force <e>", "<cs> as i understand the proper procedure in order to give your lordships a better appetite at seven oclock i shall make my speech on amendment no <e> <s> and after dinner when we reach amendment no <e> <s> i shall ask noble lords to remember the speech i made <e> <s> i propose then merely to rise very briefly and either ask the minister whether he agrees with my speech or if he does not agree with it say that we shall test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> that seems to be an invitation to me to curtail my speech <e>", "<cs> i think that the interventions of the noble lord lord mottistone and the minister have been very useful and have been a guide to me <e> <s> in those circumstances i think i am wrong to try to take all the speeches now in regard to amendment no <e> <s> and this amendment <e> <s> therefore having made the comments that i have on amendment no <e> <s> i propose to sit down i hope with some grace but i would hate the noble lord to think that i was not supporting the main principle of codes of practice and that they should be statutory <e> <s> i shall return to the fray when amendment no <e> <s> is reached <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if he had not before in this amendment introduced the ability to modify i should have accepted that completely <e> <s> it is the joinder of modify and subsection which makes it rather difficult for the reason that i have explained <e> <s> i shall not detain noble lords any longer <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will much more enjoy the speech now to be made by the noble lord lord mottistone than ever they have enjoyed a speech of mine <e>", "<cs> i am anxious not to detain the committee and the noble lord has been very courteous <e> <s> but i feel that a little more of an explanation is due to the committee as to what precisely would be covered by the official secrets act <e> <s> if in an immigration case as i have said where the registrar is inquiring as to whether or not there has been an improper use of powers by the home secretary and whether the data subject ought to be given certain information the secretary of state tells him that this is subject to the official secrets act or labels a document confidential does it mean that the registrar cannot then divulge this to the data subject or to the data subjects advisers <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord and in those circumstances as an expression of my gratitude i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finally takes his seat and ends his irony may i remind him that <e>", "<cs> what other adjectives would the noble lord propose <e>", "<cs> i said to the committee before that i thought this was neither the time nor the place nor are the numbers present that warrant a further discussion of this matter taking the time of the committee <e> <s> we shall obviously be returning to this theme at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in the debate upon what is a most important matter and we will certainly bear in mind for example the very helpful remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> with the leave of the committee may i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the note sounded by the one-man band if i may say so is as usual very attractive <e> <s> i shall play it over to myself in the quietness of my room at some future date and see whether i find it so attractive that this amendment need not take its place on a future occasion <e> <s> if it does i hope that the noble and learned lord will play again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i regard that intervention of the noble and learned lord as most helpful and courteous and i look forward with great pleasure to seeing whether what he has said leads to something constructive in regard to this matter <e> <s> i well understand that he has not given an undertaking <e> <s> i am most grateful for what he has said <e>", "<cs> i am almost sure that this is the final observation i am going to make in regard to tonights proceedings <e> <s> i can only say to the noble and learned lord that his orchestral concert has ended on a most harmonious note and i am grateful to him for it and on the basis of it i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way for one moment i should like to say that this front bench happens to stand for fairness <e> <s> therefore it was in the <e>", "<cs> the committee will appreciate the validity of much of what the noble lord the minister has said but at the same time it will share some of the anxieties of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> there is no doubt that this is a terrible power which quite innocently can be used in order for example to list individuals as security risks and to do so quite mistakenly <e> <s> it is not so much a question of the abuse of the power although that was a very real point that was made by the minister as the fact that somebody has made a mistake and that it can go on being repeated or continue to be on the record of some perfectly innocent citizen and nobody will ever see it except the minister who has had a report made to him by somebody <e>", "<cs> i wanted to make my reply brief and i am going to try to do that in answer to the intervention <e> <s> the situation is difficult <e> <s> one does not know whether it will be some person with judicial authority who will have the power to investigate generally and to see for example how reliable is the information which is being given in order for certain <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly sure that the committee will have heard with a great degree of pleasure and if i may say so with quite a degree of admiration what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> i know he will have in mind that not only is this introduction of immigration control causing a great deal of concern but it is a new measure in this bill in the sense that when the governments white paper came out and the question of exemptions was thought of in regard to subject access and non-disclosure immigration control was not mentioned at all <e> <s> it is significant that that should be so and that the white paper went on to say so far as i remember that the exceptions to the rule must be made as small and as few as possible <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord takes the course that i think he wishes to take i wonder if one thing could be clarified by the noble baroness whose participation in the committees proceedings we all very much welcome <e> <s> i am not clear about whether there is a specific exemption in the bill which covers the situation where the source clearly appears on the record that has been made and if there is something in the bill which enables the data user in this case to tell the data subject that the data subject is entitled to a copy of everything but not the source which is on the computer <e> <s> i am not clear about that <e> <s> if it is not in the bill a different consideration arises <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord because it gives me quite pompously the opportunity of saying that it is a procedure which i had the honour of suggesting in the procedure committee and which was subsequently adopted <e> <s> therefore i should love to take advantage of the new rule as it were to ask that this be done and that the linkage takes place in the report of our proceedings that subsequently appears <e> <s> i cannot sufficiently express my gratitude to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i love to follow the noble lord the minister when he reminisces in the humorous way that he does about previous metaphors that he has used especially when they relate to the animal kingdom <e>

is not recognisable as a unicorn <e> <s> that is exactly what i am endeavouring to provide for <e> <s> when one is legislating is it not sensible to try to provide for all contingencies <e> <s> the noble lord said that <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can abbreviate the proceedings by saying that the two noble lords who have just spoken have said everything that i would have said in reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> all i want to do is to thank her for her promise to reconsider in the light of what has been said today <e> <s> in those circumstances <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appealed to the graciousness of the noble baroness and it would be singularly ungracious of me if i did not at once acknowledge that she has a technical point which is absolutely correct quite obviously i have seen that there is some error but whether it is a typographical error that has occurred i do not know <e> <s> the intention of the amendment was to remove subsection from the bill on the ground that the secretary of states power was unlimited except that the affirmative resolution procedure would have to go before both houses of parliament <e> <s> clearly that is not a sufficient safeguard in all circumstances as we well know <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate as i am sure does everyone the art of the noble earl the minister in defending questions may i ask him whether he can please be positive and answer the noble lord lord ezra as to what are the governments policies in order to try to keep down this dreadful unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one lesson to be learned from the opening words of the minister <e> <s> it is that one should not be put off by his frostiness and should realise that there is a sun that will melt the frost and that deep consideration will always be given in spite of a frosty reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would mind a short intervention which may lead him to write to my noble friend myself and any other noble lord interested on the subject <e> <s> having listened very carefully to what the noble lord the minister has said again i wonder whether the house realises as i understand to be the case but i may he wrong that if the government chief whip decides on a word processor to send out a circular letter and i assure the noble lord the minister that the same would apply to the opposition chief whip and that letter is to be worded in one way to members of the front bench and in another way to back-benchers and therefore on the word processor there is the indication that this goes out to the front bench and this goes out to the back-benchers this would be caught by the bill and the opposition chief whip as well as the government chief whip would presumably have to register <e> <s> i ask this as a question and quite obviously i know that it will interest noble lords administratively logically and legalistically <e> <s> therefore as i have said if the noble lord is not able to reply at the moment i shall be grateful if he can do so between now and third reading

me in not too uncomplimentary terms <e> <s> i am most grateful for the remarks which i know i shall read with pleasure in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may add to the general fulminations which have been directed at the noble <e>", "<cs> and authority my lords as i am reminded by the very helpful suggestion of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> advisory councils as the noble lord lord mottistone said can of course be set up <e> <s> they are voluntary bodies <e> <s> one does not know who their personnel will be who will be the nominating authorities and indeed what work they will do <e> <s> the

paper that was issued by the government does have proper authority <e>", "<cs> and with the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that a further lengthy speech is called for nor would it be welcome <e> <s> i want to make only one or two very brief observations <e> <s> for the first one i am indebted to the noble lord lord avebury who handed me since he himself has to be silent having spoken once a copy of the governments white paper <e> <s> the relevant paragraph when one deals with the question of the number of codes of practice that might be involved is paragraph <e> <s> i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for the gracious words he used in accepting this amendment and concession <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be most grateful to the noble lord the minister for the very clear explanation he has given to the house of the reason for this amendment which is obviously desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords my contribution will be a short one <e> <s> i think it is extremely dangerous that we are dealing not for the first time with the question of social workers and the right of the data subject who is being assisted by social workers to information first of all as to whether there are data and then what those data are <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord the minister it is very difficult indeed to swallow the fact that at this stage report stage of the second time that the bill has been before parliament the situation has not yet been reached on this vital matter where <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the slightest doubt that this is a most difficult part of our consideration <e> <s> quite a different approach has to be made as has been pointed out to medical records from the considerations which apply to social workers records <e> <s> almost the only consideration in regard to medical records is whether or not it is for the good of the patient to know what is upon them <e> <s> but when we get <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl very often helps the house and i believe that he may have helped the house on this occasion but i should like to add one very short point <e> <s> in this bill we are for the very first time affording rights to data subjects and casting duties upon data users <e> <s> it would be an entirely wrong way of adapting the principles of this bill if what we were doing was to give somebody outside both classes of data subject and data users rights which they never had before this bill was passed <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey has said we are not dealing with examples that the noble lord the minister gave of producing a driving licence and so forth <e> <s> that is there to be produced and is a perfectly proper requirement and the driving licence will have endorsements upon it if they are there to be seen <e> <s> it has got nothing to do with producing a certificate relating to the award of a diploma or degree <e> <s> but what it does do for the very first time if we are not careful is that it enables an employer to say whether by way of an offer of employment or the continuance of employment that he wants to be sure that that person has rights under the bill that he wants to enforce those rights so far as that person is concerned and that it is a condition of the offer of employment and of the continuance of employment that he applies under part iii of the bill and produces it <e> <s> this must be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is very courteous <e> <s> i did have an opportuiity to give him very short notice of the point i am about to raise <e> <s> this amendment deals with a very important matter that is the compensation that can be awarded to a data subject by reason of an inaccurate record <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was endeavouring to speak on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords on new clause as in amendment no <e> <s> if the house will bear with me <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only a short point but i think an important one which relates to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there may be quite a lot of misunderstanding about this amendment <e> <s> let me make it perfectly clear that noble lords on the benches which i have the privilege to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the gracious way in which she referred to my contribution to the debate on the amendment in committee <e> <s> i am equally grateful for the consideration which has been given to the principles that we then tried to advance and personally i feel that these amendments cover the points that were then made <e> <s> i repeat my gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the noble lords jubilation and hope that a similar lot will befall these benches in due course <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister aware as i gather from his answer he is that this is a growing evil not least because of the youngsters who unfortunately after leaving school are in many cases without employment <e> <s> is he also aware of the growing evil of the fact that these gambling machines are gambling one way only that is the proprietor always wins and the person concerned and this is especially serious in the case of a juvenile always loses <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister continue the reputation that he has in this house for gallantry and not continue to reply as he did to my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> she did not proffer her guidance but asked the noble lord the minister to look at amendments that were put down by the opposition which are extremely relevant to this matter which were very helpful but which at the time the government saw fit to refuse

is a very dangerous subject extremely dangerous <e> <s> no doubt when the noble lord resumes he will be more careful and will remember the result of his own partys activities in the greater london

matter comes to be decided <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene for a moment to mention a further difficulty which seems to me to arise out of this amendment apart from those to which the noble and learned lord has drawn our attention <e> <s> he gave the example on second reading and repeated it today of the gentleman climbing the ladder and the obligation to draw his attention to a defective third rung <e> <s> this amendment presupposes that the proprietor of the land or house in question is judge and jury and that he is able to call upon his own judgment to decide at a time

stage and not after the verdict of the judge and jury that the vital decision has to be taken <e> <s> if i may say so this is a most unrealistic amendment and one that would presume the proprietor of

temptation to indulge in some of this pleasant atmosphere by expressing my own thanks to the noble lord the minister for his continuous courtesy and help <e> <s> on these occasions one remembers those worthy organisations which even though they may not have the adeptness of the civil service which serves the minister help to give those in opposition the chance of an authoritative brief when they

over the workforce to private enterprise instead of keeping it where it is <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a simple problem before the house <e> <s> whenever i say that i find that i have oversimplified

the proprietor was merely in one case endeavouring to cover some possibly minor part of his expenses or in the other case making quite a large profit out of the entry fee <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not hope to equal the persistence of the noble baroness who has just spoken but may i press the noble lord the minister on one aspect <e> <s> will he agree that because of the complexity of this report it is unlikely that legislation on insolvency matter will take place at anything like an early date following on the white paper because of the number of consultations that will have to be involved <e> <s> will he not agree therefore that this question of wrongful trading which is so much hurting our little people in commerce might be legislated upon separately and then to carry that through into any other legislation which may be enacted a very long time afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider placing the considerable irony which he has now put at the disposal of the national interest back again into private interest and privatising it for the general benefit of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged by the noble and learned lord lord

those of your lordships who took part in the discussions on this bill should like to reciprocate the warmness of the noble and learned lord in expressing his gratitude to those of us who tried to make intelligent contributions and say how much we all appreciated the great courtesy that he extended to us in listening to our arguments and giving the impression that he thought that they were worthy of his consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords if ever there were a field in which the legislator has to be careful it is the very field that we have journeyed through tonight <e> <s> it is true to say that while one has to have moral values and standards one cannot he merely the preacher <e> <s> it is also true that while it is useful to have experience one cannot be only the practitioner <e> <s> lastly it is true that although you have to have views you must not be only the partisan <e> <s> it is indeed in that spirit that we have to look at a bill of this kind assisted as we always are by the reports of the law commission for which this house ought to be most grateful and assisted too by the guidance that we have had from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in his opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i always enjoy answering the noble lord lord morris when he intervenes but i am afraid that is where my enjoyment ends <e> <s> i hope that with others of your lordships

it <e> <s> was it not the very essence of that debate that there should be more community involvement with the police <e> <s> is this not an excellent way of showing it <e> <s> and are the government going to encourage it as much as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord the minister catch the anxiety in the house following upon what the noble lord has just said in his supplementary question <e> <s> would he regard cost effectiveness as being the least priority in this matter instead of one of the main priorities <e> <s> will the noble lord kindly answer this question <e> <s> in regard to youth custody orders is it not correct that in the passage of the criminal justice bill the hope was expressed by the government that youth custody orders would be on the decrease <e> <s> has that hope so far been fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that there can be no peace in lebanon until all foreign forces have withdrawn <e> <s> will she further agree that there was a pact between the israeli and lebanese governments which called for a withdrawal of israeli forces with which the israeli government have <e>", "<cs> how right it is that this should

states to be exceptional <e> <s> they are out of the ordinary and that is something that the layman and the judge if i may say so with respect would understand <e> <s> our difficulty in regard to the other context was to know when hardship becomes exceptional hardship when depravity can be tolerated as being perfectly all right and when it becomes exceptional <e> <s> i do not think the difficulties apply in the same way to this amendment when you ally it to the word circumstances <e>", "<cs> i do not think it would be appropriate to divide the committee at this hour <e> <s> in view

scoring the eventual goal i am sure the committee would be satisfied <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient in the hope that possibly we can conclude at least the argument on this amendment before we adjourn our proceedings so that the noble and learned lord can with his usual courtesy consider the arguments if i enlarge upon <e>",

bench about the inadequacy of the licensing procedure for all these weapons <e> <s> does the minister agree that a further inquiry into the matter by the government is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister forgive me and not think me discourteous if i ask him one further question on a matter which i know is of great concern to the house <e> <s> he stated that there was no unambiguous evidence about a connection between the licensing of firearms as at present regulated and crimes of violence <e> <s> in view of the ambiguous nature of that reply does not the minister consider that it might be worthwhile to carry out an experiment to see whether strengthening the licensing laws results in a reduction in crime levels <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> may i say on behalf

would want to be spoilsports and all of us appreciate that round about november-time is a happy time for young people is it not a fact that the time taken of the very valuable services of the various fire brigades throughout the country is largely employed on the night of th november in a way which is not most fruitful and is in some cases dangerous when there are other fires for other reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords only so that we end this question on a jovial note may i ask the minister whether our children and grandchildren might not suggest that one of his qualifications should be to have a red nose <e>", "<cs> of course the committee will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for his statement that in respect of at least one phase of this difficult matter there will be reconsideration by the draftsman <e> <s> i believe that if i may say so with deep respect the matter is getting a little confused <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord and indeed the

amendment <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree but i can only tell the noble and learned lord in case he thinks me discourteous that i had of course already discussed the matter with the noble baroness beforehand <e>", "<cs> i must rise to the bait <e>", "<cs> i shall say only one thing <e> <s> possibly the committee would now like to hear the noble baroness to see what she would like to do with her amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee is grateful to the noble and learned lord for his brief summary of the present position but it is a position that was highlighted in the law commissions report <e> <s> may i refer the committee only because it is an important matter to page of the law commission report no <e> <s> <e> <s> in paragraph it refers to the technical matter on which the commission believes action should be taken when an appropriate opportunity presents itself <e> <s> it then points out of course that the present position under the law is that under most pension schemes it is the widow at the time of death obviously who is entitled to the pension and the previous wife has no entitlement under most pension schemes <e> <s> in paragraph the report recommends somewhat ominously for some of us that the commission expects there to be an evolution away from the concept of lifelong support for divorced wives <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the last thing in the world i would want to do would be to cause a liability to maintain children to cease in those circumstances <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>

parties <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord is going to look at that case i am going to look at the mess that my amendment may be in if it in fact includes children <e> <s> perhaps between now and report stage some accommodation can be reached either that i have made a good point or a bad point <e> <s> if it is a good one then an amendment can be agreed at report stage if it is a bad one then i shall not come back <e>", "<cs> i wonder if my noble friend and the committee will forgive me if before my noble friend withdraws her amendment i make a few short observations which the noble and learned lord may care to consider <e> <s> i may be wrong about this but i believe that i am right in saying that at the present moment if the two parties to a divorce by consent draw up a financial agreement which provides for maintenance to be increased by the cost of living index over a period of years or indeed for the lifetime of that maintenance agreement the courts will make a consent order along those lines <e> <s> i believe it is equally correct to say that the courts at the present moment by way of limitation of their jurisdiction in these matters cannot themselves make an order which will provide in the future for the linkage of maintenance to the cost of living index <e>", "<cs> i really am tiring the committee possibly but i promise only one sentence <e> <s> i especially said tying it to the cost of living index so that there would not be any question of guessing <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause be omitted from the bill <e> <s> so that the committee is aware <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am disappointed with the reply of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it was given with his usual courtesy and clarity of mind and it was good to hear him say that he is not hostile to the conception <e> <s> but i must confess that i am terribly disappointed that the opportunity has not been taken to do much more about merger and to create the family court <e> <s> there was one misstatement that the noble and learned lord made and knowing him as i do i am sure that that was a mistake that he would want to correct <e> <s> he said very boldly that the profession was against the idea <e>", "<cs> with great respect if he reads <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said very correctly in his second reading speech that it is a pretty good guiding principle to follow the recommendations of the law commission when you re trying to deal with an aspect of law reform <e> <s> obviously it was implied in that remark that you are dealing not only with very experienced and reliable people but also with people who have researched their subjects and taken a great deal of trouble before they make their recommendations <e> <s> therefore one does not follow them if i may say so at ones peril as a rule <e> <s> i wonder therefore whether i may be allowed to quote from page of the law commissions report cmnd <e> <s> in order that we may know what it is that they recommend and how near that is to the amendment which has been put down in the name of my noble and learned friend and myself and also in exactly the same spirit in the other amendment with which we are dealing that in the names of the noble lords lord mcgregor and lord donaldson <e> <s> this is what the commission said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister realise that the anxiety of this house on all sides exists because of the lamentably low standards that at present exist <e> <s> does he remember not only the discussion at committee stage as the noble lord lord hunt reminded him but also the resistance to an amendment regarding standards which was answered by the promised publication of the standards <e> <s> lastly may i ask the minister whether he does not realise that the excuse given namely that of expense may apply to the application of standards but does not apply to the publication of those standards with reasons being given why they cannot be implemented at once <e> <s> will the minister therefore try to expedite the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the noble lord the minister whether with his usual courtesy he will answer my last question why must there be any delay in the publication of what the standards should be <e> <s> one would accept thereafter the reason for not implementing those standards for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister gets too irate will he acknowledge that the house was delighted to learn that a letter which is being sent out has received a clear english award <e> <s> in view of the question asked earlier by the noble lord lord rochester would he care to inform the house whether this admirable letter was drafted by a graduate civil servant or a non-graduate civil servant <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that a lot of misunderstanding can be created by the answers given to the original question of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> does she realise that the implication of her answers might be that the documents that are being retained at the foreign and commonwealth office are not being released because they are harmful to the case that we wish to present on sovereignty <e> <s> does she realise that the government might be accused of taking up a position of deception <e> <s> does she therefore wish to clarify her response in order to make it quite clear that we have nothing to hide and are not trying to deceive <e>", "<cs> my lords blessed is the person who in a short debate avoids repeating what previous speakers have said and manages to speak rapidly <e> <s> i intend to abide by that opening maxim <e> <s> however in doing so i must say that those of us in this house who hold the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in affectionate regard there are such noble lords in all parts of the chamber will first be grateful to him for having put down this motion <e> <s> furthermore we will not have been surprised by the content of his speech attacking as it did violence and sex in the theatre in other places of entertainment generally and today in particular in broadcasting <e> <s> many of us and here i include myself and my noble friends admire the noble lords campaign and think that it is justified <e> <s> having said that i need not repeat what he has said so eloquently <e>", "<cs> my lords when addressing the house during a short debate which was attended by even more of your lordships than are at present here i said that it was a lesson that one learned not to repeat what others had said perfectly eloquently and clearly <e> <s> in having the privilege of winding up the debate on behalf of the opposition i intend to follow that maxim at this late hour <e> <s> like the other noble lords who have spoken i am most grateful to my stalwart noble friend lord longford for having returned to the fray <e> <s> he will never give up the battle for the improvement of the parole system <e> <s> as a non-trinity man and therefore with a much more objective view may i congratulate the maiden speaker in the debate the noble lord lord henniker <e> <s> if i may say so he spoke most attractively to the house and showed an expertise that we hope to experience again in future debates <e>", "<cs> my lords the voice was the charming voice of the noble baroness the pen was the mighty pen of the noble lord the minister lord elton <e> <s> we well recognise the reason for his having been delayed <e> <s> we therefore wish to thank both of them for the introduction of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these opposition benches are grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable and learned friend in another place <e> <s> it is on such an occasion as this that all members of your lordships house speak with one voice and that was exemplified by the visit paid by the prime minister the home secretary the leader of the opposition

intervene i think he was quoting something that i said when i in turn was quoting hunt <e> <s> i specifically said that i thought these interactive services would be of great benefit especially to physically handicapped people <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to intervene only because i did not raise this point in my speech since i thought that it was long enough as it was <e> <s> however in the racial incitement clause which is very important i notice that the only word used is words <e> <s> pictorial display is not mentioned <e> <s> this is a very menacing form of racial hatred <e> <s> i ask the noble lord not to deal with the point now but to look at it since it would save an amendment at the committee stage if i happen to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to follow the artistry of the noble and learned lord in short and pithy replies which he illustrated so well at question time <e> <s> therefore i merely thank him for the consideration that he kindly gave to my amendment and readily admit that his formula is a great improvement on mine <e> <s> the bill has now been improved as a result of our joint efforts mine being the minor part <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for his explanation of the order <e> <s> he is absolutely right that the whole question of parole was debated very fully in your lordships house <e> <s> i can only say and i say it very humbly that i wish that the attendance in the house at that time had been greater and that the hour at which that debate took place could have been earlier because it was a very important debate especially having regard to our overcrowded prisons and the great national need to face the figures of crime that are ever before us <e>", "<cs> my lords this time the minister has not been short on words but he has been somewhat ambiguous <e> <s> he stated that he was not aware that the association was uncontented <e> <s> could he be rather more positive <e> <s> is the association content <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> as is expected of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he has given us a very clear lucid account of a good humane bill and in case any words of mine might be misinterpreted in describing the noble lords always welcome contributions to this house may i add that in my view he was as concise as was reasonable in his explanation <e> <s> it is a good humane bill and i am sure that it will be welcomed in its general terms in all sections of the house <e> <s> because of its humane content i believe that your lordships will be especially glad that this is going to be the occasion upon which the right reverend prelate the bishop of bristol will be making his maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure we shall all listen to him with very great pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend finishes with that point south africa was not an example which i gave though i wish i had thought of it would he not think it really terrible that we should hold in our prisons <e> <s> subject to prison discipline those who had been convicted under south africas apartheid laws <e> <s> even if prisoners wanted to come back here does not that cast a shadow upon our own administration in our own country <e>", "<cs> does the noble viscount the minister agree that a great responsibility rests upon our parliament in this matter in view of the unhappy situation that stormont is not sitting <e> <s> will he give the house an assurance that all the papers that were made available and all the evidence that was submitted and placed before the director of public prosecutions will be made fully available to this latest inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount the minister agree that the question is so important that i would hope that he would carry it back to his right honourable friend <e> <s> will the noble viscount take with him the hope that all the papers and documents quite apart from the facts are made available to the present inquiry <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may venture to put some tidiness into the series of amendments now before the committee <e> <s> it may be unfortunate that it is an amendment from the opposition which first deals with the question of the numbers of those who sit upon the authority <e> <s> all the contributions made so far if i may say so are very relevant <e> <s> but the committee will have realised that subsequent amendments have been tabled which propose that various interests should be represented <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord aylestone spoke about this and how welcome it was to have that intervention in committee <e> <s> that will be welcomed from all sides <e>", "<cs> let me reply at once that we are in a position of neutrality until we hear the reply of the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i did not expect such co-operation from the minister on any amendment not moved by himself <e> <s> may i just utter this caveat <e> <s> i would have hoped that this amendment too would have been withdrawn for this reason <e> <s> whereas it may be very proper to prescribe a minimum when one is legislating for very much an unknown quantity and we will be saying this very often during this committee stage to fix a maximum produces a difficulty <e> <s> nobody wants to see an authority overburdened in numbers and nobody wants to see a very large committee as it were looking after the authoritys <e>", "<cs> since i earlier moved the amendment perhaps i ought to say that together with my noble friend <e> <s> i welcome the assurance <e> <s> however i wonder whether the minister will consider saying that he is prepared to give further consideration to the question of representation as mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> that would make my task rather easier for the sole reason that i am sure the minister has in mind that members of the authority at all events to start with are to be part time apart from the chairman and the vice-chairman i am not quite sure whether they too are to be part-time <e> <s> therefore it would do very little harm to make provision as we propose for the representation of the various areas of the united kingdom on the basis that possibly those members at all events for the time being would be part-timers <e> <s> if having regard to the discussion that has taken place the noble lord the minister would be prepared to say that he would again look at the matter i should be perfectly happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall use the formula that is well known to your lordships committee and say that i shall consider most carefully what the noble lord the minister has said and at this stage beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> after such courtesy paying tribute to eloquence on one side of the committee and amiability on the other i find it extremely difficult to answer the noble lord at all crossly and indeed i do not do so <e> <s> however i should like to turn to the points raised by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> his argument would have been very effective indeed if he had done the usual homework that he always does when taking part in any questions in which he is such a very interesting contributor and had looked at the broadcasting act which i quoted <e> <s> the broadcasting act has precisely those safeguard words that are in the bill they appear there word for word <e> <s> but the broadcasting act went on to say because the general words were not thought to be sufficient that what one must do very specifically is to see that nobody interested in advertising and nobody interested in the supply of equipment which was relevant should in fact sit upon the authority <e>", "<cs> in order that the argument at least follows in a logical sequence perhaps i may deal with what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> in all humility i believe it has generally been forgotten from where my amendment originates <e> <s> i have an idea and i may be venturesome in saving so that it is not realised where my amendment comes from so much so that although the noble lord the minister quoted just now the act from which it comes and said that that may have been all right years ago i was quoting from the broadcasting act which was passed only three years ago <e> <s> three years ago parliament decided that these words were necessary in addition to the words contained in the bill <e> <s> at that time there were many debates and there were those who advocated as have the noble lord lord marsh and the noble lord opposite that in various parts of the bill there should be simplicity and economy of language <e> <s> nevertheless it was decided that these matters were sufficiently sensitive with regard to broadcasting to be included so there was no doubt that the minister was properly warned with regard to an appointment <e>", "<cs> this is the last time that i shall rise because i may lose support if i become too verbose and rise too often on this amendment and i do not want to lose support <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is quite right but he knows as well as i do that when consolidating measures parliament has the right to remove from bills that it is considering anything that is otiose <e> <s> in this case parliament in my opinion very wisely did not think it necessary to do so <e>", "<cs> i have moved the amendment and ask for the opinion of the committee to be taken <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend lord ardwick will agree that it is necessary to weigh up what has been said on this important matter and consider whether or not it is necessary to come back at report stage to the amendment <e> <s> with the leave of the committee therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i wish it were as easy as that and i wish that the wisdom of the right honourable and learned friend of the noble lord was guaranteed under the bill for all time and indeed that he was allowed to sit if there were a conservative government for a great number of years as secretary of state <e>", "<cs> and so do i but before the noble lord sits down in peace and quiet perhaps i may say that there is nothing in this amendment about representation of the entertainment industry <e> <s> that was <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister will note my generosity and will find it possible to reciprocate <e> <s> we do not intend to oppose any of these amendments <e>", "<cs> may i merely say that the government are extremely fortunate in having the noble baroness lady trumpington to represent them she can get away with anything <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble baroness this is not just a technical amendment <e> <s> i will explain why because i think the committee if i may say so must know what it is doing if it is agreeing to this amendment <e> <s> i do not intend to oppose it but i want to add a qualification to it <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry but when i said on page i was referring to subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has in a much nicer voice repeated what i said <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a query from these benches to that raised by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> in my reading of the bill and i am sure that it is my fault i could find nothing which made the start of the licence time run from the start of the programmes <e> <s> i though that it ran from the start of the grant of the licence <e> <s> it may be that i am completely wrong <e> <s> if i happen to be right then of course the noble lords point about the question of time becomes a very essential element in our future discussions because if a licensee takes an inordinate amount of time in which to lay his cable and an inordinate amount of time to start his programmes it may make matters very difficult <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to take time on this point but it is important perhaps the noble lord would be good enough between now and the report stage to consider with his advisers whether this aspect is sufficiently clear from the bill both as guidance to the licensing authority that is the cable authority as well as to licensees <e> <s> i follow his point that clause says that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may assist on this it is my wish to do so <e> <s> i can well understand the arguments in this matter as i am sure the noble lord the minister can with his usual breadth of mind <e> <s> the first argument is that if one ties the hands of the authority it can only vary a licence where it has warned on the grant of a licence that it might do so in respect of any term or condition <e> <s> that has the grave disadvantage that nobody can foresee what situations may arise which may cause the variation <e> <s> on the other hand there is the case against a variation which says that the difficulty is that there is as it were a contract the licensee on the basis of the terms and conditions has decided to invest his money in the project and it is unfair if he receives a material variation shot at him out of the blue <e> <s> those are the two arguments <e>", "<cs> i agree that this is a technical amendment and i agree that the noble baroness is dealing with the right amendment <e> <s> i do not intend to oppose it <e>", "<cs> there is a further point <e> <s> unless i am very much mistaken this point has been missed in the discussion so far <e> <s> the cable operator ought to have the opportunity to know what his commitments are before he agrees to apply and before he accepts the licence <e> <s> this is a matter of equity <e> <s> i can well understand that reasonable fees are in the mind of the noble lord the minister because he is a reasonable person but the fact remains that if an annual fee can be charged over a period of years and if there is no limit whatsoever to that annual fee and the expenses of the authority with a maximum of members now and a minimum of five are again an unknown quantity the licence holder will not be in a position to tell what his likely liability is going to be <e> <s> it is all very well to say that it is bound to be reasonable and restrained and to be within certain limits <e> <s> the fact remains that under the bill there is no limit whatsoever <e> <s> although i do not accept the wording of this amendment i feel that some provision must be inserted which meets that point of equity <e> <s> if we were to say that the licence fee i am not putting this forward as an amendment i am not allowed to do so at this stage was in no circumstances to exceed a certain sum <e>", "<cs> if i may speak just once again to help and i promise the committee very briefly <e> <s> the defect in what the noble lord the minister has just helpfully said is that we all know that the report stage procedure is not the best way of getting reforms or amendments made <e> <s> there can be a debate on report but as a rule one is left with a debate <e> <s> it is very difficult to enforce any amendment to a bill or any power of an authority when one is debating the matter on report <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely wonderful what a dinner recess can do to the noble lord the minister in making him so agreeable <e> <s> obviously i am very happy to accept his undertaking <e> <s> in those circumstances and with i hope good grace i ask for the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is not the time at past nine in the evening to indulge in comparative political theory <e> <s> i would say only that the noble lord lord mottistone misinterprets the view of the opposition which favours in a mixed economy that there should be competition in the private sector <e> <s> it is only when there is unfair competition with the public sector that the opposition raises its voice in a most eloquent and powerful way but nevertheless fails to persuade the noble lord on every single occasion <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister realises that i responded to his suggestion made on the previous amendment that in order that he could succeed in what he said i should not participate or give him support <e> <s> i have tried awfully hard to obey his instruction <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly clarify the position <e> <s> as one would expect the noble lord the deputy chairman is absolutely correct in what he has said <e> <s> our proposals are divided into five amendments <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee my noble friend lord ardwick has spoken to all five though technically he is moving amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> with that one has to be democratically content <e> <s> nevertheless it is still possible to urge upon the committee on what is really a completely non-political matter commonsense and justice <e> <s> again and again members of the committee on all sides of the chamber have shown that they are worried about the artificial severance of the telecommunications bill from this bill <e> <s> to hear the minister say on behalf of the home office which he represents with such elegance <e>", "<cs> quite obviously the great difficulty is leaving things vaguely in a bill taking it for granted that the authority will consider whatever it may be and leaving over the argument to applicants that it would be quite wrong for the authority to consider prices because in the matters of importance that were set out on the applications the price charged to the consumer was not even mentioned <e>", "<cs> with the passage of every minute upon the clock the noble lord the minister is mellowing more and more <e> <s> in those circumstances and having regard to the courteous way in which he has dealt with this amendment and the undertaking he has given i am delighted to withdraw <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friends and myself may i say that we completely support the spirit behind the amendment <e> <s> obviously we await what the noble lord the minister has to say about any difficulties that there may be which it is hoped can be ironed out <e> <s> however we wholeheartedly support the spirit behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister build on that sympathy which he has expressed and which we are all sure is sincere <e> <s> i do not think that one should enter onto what i believe is called a pilpulistic argument i am rather proud of that word and deal with a very serious subject as the noble lord the minister admits in a rather narrow way <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest and great respect to what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> it is his language which made me introduce the word learned <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord realises that this was not only protection for the consumer and for standards but also a protection for intending applicants <e> <s> it is not enough to say that the authority when the applicant reads the bill has to take certain matters into account which are very essential matters <e> <s> what would guide the applicant as <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord the minister had used the words mandatorily hypothecated i should not have called him learned <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has with his usual courtesy thanked those who assisted him on this bill and i believe that the house would in turn wish to thank him for the as usual persuasive and very clear way in which he guided the house through a very difficult and complex but nevertheless extremely useful measure <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships will wish this bill success <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that i am only giving a personal point of view and the house knows that their are no whips on so far as the benches that i have the honour to sit upon are concerned <e> <s> from my own personal point of view i do not think that this is a good amendment but i approach my arguments in that connection on i hope a moderate path on a polite path and i hope on a path respectful to the bishops benches <e>", "<cs> my lords what a treat the house has had in having such a learned argument between four eminent lawyers and what a muddle the house must be in as a result <e> <s> i promise the noble and learned lord that i will not muddle my way through an argument i will try if i may to be abundantly clear even if my arguments be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am helped by that remark that that was the commissions final conclusion <e> <s> all it had to say was we agree with the existing law and we agree with the way in which conduct is now being treated in our courts <e> <s> that is not what was said at all <e> <s> although the noble and learned lord correctly and fairly quoted from the report of the law commission i know he would be the first who would in frankness agree with me that he merely quoted one sentence <e> <s> i shall have to ask your <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend and i know the noble and learned lord will not think me discourteous in saying it to go down the very path that he warned us all not to go down that is to enter into tortuous arguments which are not absolutely material to the matter we have before us <e>", "<cs> may i make it clear at the outset that we on these benches support completely the principles that have just been enunciated by the noble lord lord hill <e> <s> i wonder whether the committee would think it sensible that instead of having speeches on three separate amendments we deal in this debate with the principles behind the three amendments <e> <s> i believe i have the consent of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney to say this in regard to his own amendment which appears as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we can then see where we are going on this principle and possibly in the light of the reply of the noble lord the minister find our way through to a successful and good amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the interruption of the interruption i will merely say that the noble lord the minister may recall that in i believe a second reading speech he stated that it was the intention of the government that the authority should have a very loose rein <e>", "<cs> the noble earl with his usual courtesy has paused to enable me to reply to his observation and i am obliged to him <e> <s> i was referring the committee to the speech made by the minister at second reading and i believe that the noble lord the minister did assent to the way in which i paraphrased his remarks <e> <s> i was not referring to the white paper <e>", "<cs> before the question is put perhaps the noble lord lord hill of luton only so that all of us who are behind him in principle can show proper support for him but in a wise way will support me in asking whether the noble lord the minister can go this far <e> <s> he said he finds it difficult if not impossible to put an exact proportion in the bill <e> <s> is he prepared to give this assurance to the committee which i think would help us all <e> <s> first will he take back the words as he indicated to see whether or not words which are more mandatory and clearer in their requirement than now appear in the bill could be incorporated without a given percentage <e> <s> secondly is he prepared to give an assurance that the government will indicate to the authority in very clear terms that the aim of the government will be to see that the same proportions as with the iba are reached as soon as possible bearing in mind the difficulties of across-the-board or individual programmes as were mentioned by the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister can give those two simple assurances i believe it might help all of us to decide whether a division in committee is necessary <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness saying that the provision is capable of more than one interpretation and that therefore in order to ensure that it shall be clear she may take another look at it before the report stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble baroness for her very determined reply <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate my noble friends with the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord <e> <s> i was surprised to learn in the literature from the organisation at the bbc looking after the deaf that as many as per cent <e> <s> of the viewing population suffer from deafness <e> <s> that is a moving percentage <e> <s> i do not know whether members of the government front bench will feel that they are particularly sympathetic to the needs of the deaf in view of the fact they have been so deaf to all the entreaties amendments and pleas made by my noble friends and myself <e>", "<cs> in regard to advertising this limitation was imposed upon independent television in order to see that improper inducements were not made which were not deemed to accord with proper advertising standards <e> <s> in regard to programmes which do not constitute advertising it was thought improper that programme viewers should be bought <e> <s> it is particularly important that they should not be <e>", "<cs> i must not keep bobbing up <e> <s> i certainly shall not be bobbing up at dinner time i promise your lordships <e> <s> parliament in its wisdom decided first in regard to advertising that it was improper and not in accordance with proper standards for prizes to be awarded on independent television by advertisers <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone is good enough to indicate that he understands that part of it and i rather gather would agree with it <e> <s> at least i have a vote for subsection of my amendment <e>", "<cs> that gives me confidence <e>", "<cs> i thought from what the noble lord the minister said that he had secret information that i was to have the support of the bishops benches <e> <s> i was looking forward so much to certain speeches being made by the two right reverend prelates whom we are delighted to see with us at this time <e> <s> but my prayers in this connection have not been answered <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord the minister will not be seduced by that appeal <e> <s> i cannot think of a more seductive member of this chamber than the noble lord lord mottistone nevertheless i hope that the minister will not yield to his argument <e> <s> this is getting to be terribly dangerous <e> <s> the noble lord referred to equality of influence of various people or bodies that might be consulted <e> <s> if indeed his argument were turned the other way and other bodies were to have a greater influence than the independent broadcasting authority it would mean that the authority is going to be put under precisely the same disability that so many of us fear in regard to its advertising income <e> <s> the noble lord the minister gave the example of the same advertiser being allowed to put out a different advertisement on ita than on cable by virtue of the fact that cable was not restricted by the same standards <e> <s> what we are going to have if we are not terribly careful is a weakening of the standards of independent broadcasting and television because they are going to be unfairly robbed of advertising revenue <e> <s> this is a dangerous course that we may embark upon if we are not very careful <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness concludes i am sure we have all listened with respect as we always do to what she has said can she find some provision in this clause and if a slight interval of time is required to answer this i shall well understand or in the bill which makes the authority publish other than the word to draw up which of course is not the same as to publicise <e> <s> that is quite apart from the point about this being done prior to the grant of any licences <e> <s> can she explain under what code of advertising the licensees will operate before this code is publicised <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press the noble baroness unduly or waste the time of the committee but i am not quite sure i understand why there should be a duty to publicise implied in an act when the act does not specifically say that it should be publicised <e> <s> secondly would the noble baroness not agree that it is a little unrealistic to ask for applicants to apply without their knowing by what code they are bound <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord mottistone had finished his dinner earlier he would have heard me refer specifically to the fact that the noble lord the minister had earlier indicated from what date the licence was to operate <e> <s> i used almost the precise words if not in such elegant language as the noble lord lord mottistone did when describing what the minister had said <e> <s> we are dealing with an act of parliament and all this talk about well surely they will publicise and it is only reasonable to assume that they will but do not let us worry about putting this in a bill is not complying with the duty of a legislative body such as ours <e>", "<cs> i shall keep my promise and not make further speeches on this matter <e> <s> the noble baroness has again said that it is hoped that the licensees will be required to comply with the iba code <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill that says so but i do not think that at this time it is an appropriate issue on which to ask the opinion of the committee <e> <s> the noble baroness will undoubtedly have in mind what has been said and perhaps as a result one single concession may be made by the front bench <e> <s> i am thinking in terms of the unpopularity of one boycott only because he presented a straight bat for so long to his own teams annoyance <e> <s> i am hoping that that annoyance will now go to the rest of the team of the minister and the noble baroness so that they will also be annoyed at the straight bat blocking of every ball that is bowled <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in a case of that kind it is clearly a question of advertising alone <e> <s> in those circumstances no confusion is caused <e>", "<cs> our amendment has produced two very valuable assurances <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> if i went on with any speech on the amendment the assurances may be withdrawn <e> <s> i hastily accept them and ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether between now and the report stage the noble lord the minister will be prepared to consider that the amendment very carefully reproduces the words which really mean use best efforts <e> <s> in that the authority is required merely to do all that it can to secure what is referred to <e> <s> the amendment does not say that in each and every case there must be a presentation of advertising rate cards <e> <s> it states merely that there should be a proper and fair presentation <e> <s> where it would not be proper by virtue of the difficulties which the noble lord has mentioned no such duty is placed on the authority <e> <s> where it would be perfectly fair not to have a presentation in the way that the amendment proposes again there is no duty on the authority <e> <s> however as there has been an exchange of views which is a useful function during a committee stage <e>", "<cs> indeed i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i always know and i believe that members of the committee know that it is just when the noble lord lord mottistone gets angry and uses extreme language that he realises he must be on a very weak wicket because when he is on a strong one he always speaks with such moderation and persuasiveness and threatens no one <e>", "<cs> the last thing in the world i thought i was doing was offending the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> in trying to introduce a light note at this hour if anything that i have said has offended him i withdraw it completely <e> <s> perhaps rather more peacefully i can now say what i wanted to say <e> <s> it is not because of any ideology that my noble friends and i would support what the minister has said it is really on the pure case of justice <e> <s> it is a question of whether you ought or ought not to be judge in your own cause <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may stick my neck out and say that i did not read this clause in the same way as on reflection the noble lord lord mottistone read it <e> <s> if i am wrong i want to be corrected but i thought i should put the other point of view <e>", "<cs> i say this only so that the record will be clear and i shall take just one brief second <e> <s> the arbitrator or referee whom we are dealing with here does not fix his fee he fixes the proportions in which his fee shall be paid and that is having heard the parties <e> <s> i should have thought it logical that that was the proper interpretation of the section <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone may be right and i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> may i add a very brief word in support of this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that a most valuable history of precedents will have been set up by the complaints commission and that it would be a little ridiculous to ignore those precedents and the experience that has been obtained by having the authority listening to the same sort of complaints <e> <s> moreover if one separated them one would get the position where different decisions would be made on complaints of precisely the same type by the two bodies <e> <s> at first sight this seems to be a very wise amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that it would be very proper for such matters to be left to the courts <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister accept from this front bench as i am sure he would anticipate that no one condones damage to property or illegal behaviour but that the asset that we have of freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate is invaluable and certainly could not even be measured in millions of pounds <e>", "<cs> the principle of this amendment is one that would be generally accepted by the committee <e> <s> the only doubt i have i say this with great deference is whether the government have properly fully and comprehensively covered the situation they intend to cover and have done it with a sense of fairness <e> <s> there may be a change in the shareholding control of a company and as a result the authority may wish to use the power contained in the amendment <e> <s> but there is no provision in the amendment or in any part of the bill about which i know i may be wrong about that which calls upon the company to give notice to the authority of a proposed change and have prior approval for it in which case the clause would not apply <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness the minister has been extemely courteous in her answers to the points raised first by myself and then supported by other noble lords <e> <s> may i make my position perfectly clear <e> <s> i only realised the points that i made while she was explaining the meaning of and reason for the amendment otherwise i hope she will realise that i would have been courteous enough to have given her advance notice of the points i intended to make <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness finally sits down she said that the matters will be considered <e> <s> i have suggested that there should be correspondence among all those involved in this debate <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether having regard to the nature of the points that have been made the noble baroness or the noble lord would not consider withdrawing this amendment and i have waited to make this observation until the main item came forward until the matter has been clarified bringing it back at report stage if that was felt to be important <e> <s> i would not like the committee with the obvious gaps in this amendment to leave it as though it had been passed on the nod <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am rather unhappy with the reply of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he sometimes leaves me in that condition not always and i am afraid that on this occasion he has done so <e> <s> he has admitted that there is possibly a gap in the period of time between the revocation and the service to the customers a point raised by the noble lord lord mottistone and has answered it by saying that there is not a provision in the bill but the authority one imagines would allow a licensee to continue until other arrangements had been made <e> <s> there may be such a dreadful wicked licensee that that would be an impossible position for the authority to face but there is nothing in the bill which deals with that intermediate period <e> <s> but the graver gap although that is quite a grave one is the very matter that i tried to point out <e> <s> there is nothing between the penalties under the bill to which the noble lord briefly referred <e> <s> it may be irrelevant to the condition which is being breached and i repeat that it may have nothing to do with programmes <e>", "<cs> i must not prolong the debate <e> <s> i sense that there is a feeling in the committee i hope i am not being impertinent in saying this that there are gaps here which ought to be looked at <e> <s> perhaps therefore we ought to come back to it at the report stage <e> <s> i make only one observation <e> <s> the noble lord the minister took it for granted i believe in earlier discussions that the authority would be careful to ensure the financial strength of the cable operator <e> <s> in view of his assurance that this would happen i was rather distressed to hear that the revocation of a licence would make a company go into liquidation or an individual become bankrupt <e> <s> it was not the kind of cable operator that i thought we were looking at <e>", "<cs> the problem still remains <e> <s> the proper procedure for me to adopt is to ask for leave to withdraw the amendment in the hope that more consideration can be given by the noble lord the minister to the problem we have discussed <e> <s> it will give an opportunity to those noble lords who are members of the committee and to those noble lords who have not attended the proceedings this evening to read the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly deal with the noble lords point which he put with clarity but so far as i was concerned if i may say so not with conviction <e> <s> i can well understand that if one is able to point to two bills and to say that there is an equal duty of consultation one gets equality of treatment even if one does not get what the white paper proposed namely the ascendancy the <e>", "<cs> and i hope we will because i hope that the noble lord will be able at least to concede something having regard to this debate <e> <s> i was brought up on the principle that if you produce the same result <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i express the gratitude of my noble friends and myself for his having raised this point <e> <s> we did not think of it and we are most grateful to him for having brought it before the committee <e>", "<cs> we have already debated the question of whether there should be two-way consultation between the cable authority and what i have called the part ii authority of the telecommunications bill <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships would welcome at this time a repetition of any of the arguments and we can at least spare the noble lord the minister a further reply on that issue because he will have heard what was said in the previous debate <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are all very grateful for what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> may i ask whether she will give possibly added attention to what my noble friend has already said in support of this amendment in the knowledge that it has the full support of the british copyright council whose views have been paraphrased by my noble friend <e> <s> in those circumstances of course he has a very weighty source <e> <s> may i also ask the noble baroness whether in the course of her consideration without wearying the committee with arguments for the necessity of it she would consider the words <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that such an important matter as this is being raised at this late hour <e> <s> it is not a subject which can be properly debated if i may respectfully say so in such an attenuated committee <e> <s> the obvious fear of the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe and he expressed it clearly is that this is the thin end of the wedge and that the broadcasting authority and independent television may be faced with precisely the same powers which many of us might think in those circumstances to be somewhat objectionable <e> <s> we must obviously endeavour to see whether there can be some assurance in that regard upon which one can rely <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down perhaps i may say that the assurance that i sought and i borrowed the point from the noble lord lord howard was that this was not the thin end of the wedge and that it would not be used as a precedent for a similar provision to be used at some time against the bbc and itv <e> <s> this is not my point i bow to the noble lord lord howard for it but that was the assurance that i in turn sought <e>", "<cs> the committee stage of this bill which has taken quite a long time has now come to an end i hope a gracious end <e> <s> i should like on behalf of my noble friends and myself to thank the noble lord the minister for his very courteous attention to this bill and to all of us who have tried to help amend it <e> <s> i include the noble baroness lady trumpington in that word of appreciation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton has introduced the second reading debate of this very important bill with his usual clarity and we are grateful to him <e> <s> with him may i express my own pleasure and that of my noble friends that this debate will be graced by the maiden speech of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton whose face and voice are already somewhat well known to this house <e> <s> both will always be very welcome <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister said at the very outset of his speech no british parliament with our proud traditions of benefit of law civil liberties freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention rights of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for notice of that fact as i am sure the house will be and it will be interesting as it always is to see how the noble lord interprets matters <e> <s> i emphasise that the statistics i have given relate to britain that is not to northern ireland <e> <s> indeed statistics in northern ireland for the same period show a contrast <e> <s> there were detained under the legislation of whom per cent <e> <s> were eventually charged per cent

non-terrorist type offences and per cent <e> <s> were released without any charge or exclusion order <e> <s> unlike the situation in britain the number of people detained under this legislation has increased significantly in the last years <e> <s> here again more recent statistics covering the year have just been published by the home office and they indicate the same sort of percentages and the same sort of picture <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on i wonder whether the house may have the benefit of his comments and great experience in regard to that part of the clause he was just discussing which deals for the first time with an act of terrorism so-called and so-defined anywhere in the world even though it has no connection with this country at all <e> <s> does the noble lord not share the fears which organisations such as the anti-apartheid movement have about such a clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the minister for carrying out the sad duty of repeating the statement made in another place may i associate my noble friends most sincerely with the expression of sympathy to mr mhatres family in their tragic bereavement <e> <s> if i may i should like to ask a few questions for elucidation <e> <s> one notices in the statement that the kashmir liberation army is mentioned as the organisation which claims to have carried out if that is the appropriate expression this outrageous act <e> <s> have we any information at all about such an organisation <e> <s> have we had any experience of that organisation before now <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i take what the noble lord the minister has just said in the proper sense <e> <s> i should not wish to press him in view of the words that he used and in view of the care that one should exercise <e> <s> will he at least undertake to the house to take to his right honourable friend the concern of the house this being the second time in recent years that a diplomat on our shores has met with the results of severe criminal acts that diplomatic missions should have proper protection <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord the minister agree that in any study of penology a policy that gives no hope must be hopeless in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house would want to pay tribute to the law commission to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and if i may say so to the joint standing committee of which i am proud to be a member for the many consolidation measures which are coming before the house <e> <s> obviously they are extremely welcome and i think that the house ought to note the point <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an entrancing debate started if i may say so by my noble friend lord paget with his usual frank delivery and courage of content <e> <s> in a debate which includes the matter of recognition i must tell him in all frankness that at times i do not recognise to which party he belongs <e> <s> i can only say that it is always a happiness to see him sitting on our benches <e> <s> obviously it was also a privilege to listen to the noble lord lord home and to the modest provincial voice of the noble lord lord lever who

on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene i hope for the very last time to ask the house to note that while an estimate has been given of the cost of the procession the government unfortunately have been unable to put forward any estimate at all of the cost that is supposed to be saved by this abandonment of local government <e>", "<cs> the committee is always entertained by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to powerful speeches and effective reasoning <e> <s> i am afraid i must agree with the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that on this occasion he did not quite come up

procedures which normally apply <e> <s> but parliament has spoken and in those circumstances all of us in contributing to the committee stage of this bill and its later stages must accept that extraordinary legislation as a matter of principle is necessary <e> <s> the only purpose of the amendments with which my noble <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is absolutely right <e> <s> having explained to the committee what my procedure will be when we come to it i must <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that i had not got to rise again before we got to the meat of the committee stage <e> <s> how unfortunate it is that when we are deliberating serious matters of this kind certain politicians have had to justify their existence by endeavouring to make political points <e> <s> i thought i had made the position abundantly clear at second reading <e> <s> i do not want to repeat to your lordships my second reading speech <e> <s> it would be completely unfeeling of me if i did <e>", "<cs> and so we move to the real business of the committee and its real duty tonight which is to consider part ii of this bill <e>", "<cs> i am so glad that the noble lord is hearing what i have said about him <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to take part in this debate <e> <s> i had not realised that he was present <e> <s> but as i was saying if ever anyone had suffered from threats of terrorists he has and if anyone has ever courageously opposed the terrorists he has <e> <s> and he has spoken time and time again and certainly in the debate when a review of this legislation was suggested and he has come out completely against this part of the act <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will have the privilege and pleasure of hearing him in the course of this debate <e>", "<cs> everyone in this committee will have respect for the last words of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> any government having the responsibility in these troublous matters must obviously take decisions and hope that they will carry parliament in them <e> <s> i respect the point of view that the noble lord puts forward but from this dispatch box i want to make one thing absolutely clear <e> <s> there is no difference between the two parties in their abhorrence of terrorism or in the belief that where somebody has been convicted of the crime of terrorism he should be imprisoned for as long as public safety requires it and should have a very severe sentence indeed <e> <s> there is no difference between us at all <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might assist the committee <e> <s> if one turns to the explanatory memorandum on the front of the bill it says <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be appropriate when considering this amendment on which the name of my noble friend accompanies the names of the noble lord lord wigoder and his noble friend if one referred for a moment and i promise not to be long to what lord jellicoe actually said <e> <s> then i am going to follow on what my noble friend lord shackleton said in regard to what has in fact happened to journalists or people much allied to the profession of journalism <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i

consideration than we can give it tonight <e> <s> i wish to make this respectful suggestion to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> there is a <e>", "<cs> i believe it is appropriate for me to ask for the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment on the understanding which i believe i have correctly that this debate will be very carefully considered by the noble lord the minister in particular the suggestion which my noble friend lord shackleton has just made and the rather inferior suggestion compared with his which i made earlier <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord the minister has not quite followed the point that was being made <e> <s> quite obviously the secretary of state cannot be expected usually within a very short period of time to decide whether or not an arrest is lawful <e> <s> i wanted it only to be made clear by this amendment as do others that when this matter comes before the court the court is not faced with a difficult argument that this bill gives to the secretary of state a power to extend something even though the original arrest was not lawful <e> <s> that was the point i was making not that the secretary of state has necessarily to make that decision <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord will consider that point between now and report stage and let me know whether or not the amendment is acceptable because of what i have said or not acceptable in which case i can decide whether or not to put it down again at report stage <e>", "<cs> having regard to what the noble lord the minister said which we would all like to consider <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as one of many of your lordships who over the years has had the support of the noble lord lord henderson it is a great pleasure for me tonight to be able for a change to support him <e>", "<cs> may i associate my noble friends with this amendment <e> <s> the committee will not be surprised having heard the views that we put forward in regard to part ii that we support this amendment fervently <e> <s> may i take up one of the points made by the noble lord lord henderson just now when he said that the objection to a separate order in regard to each part of the bill was that it might mean that parliament had to find rather more time than if there was the dissection of parts iii and iv and then part ii <e> <s> i can only say at the conclusion of this debate on this important bill that if parliamentary programming cannot find time for four separate orders to deal with a bill which so limits the rights of subject and so impinges upon our ordinary criminal law then something is wrong with parliamentary priorities <e>", "<cs> at the end of the committee proceedings tonight we meet with the most co-operative helpful and kindly terms that the noble lord the minister had used throughout the whole of our deliberations <e> <s> it would therefore be churlish of me to do anything other than thank him for his undertaking and thank him also for the consideration which he says he will give to these various matters <e> <s> upon that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the important considerations raised in the report to which the noble lord lord avebury referred has the noble lord the minister any knowledge of any special consultations which have taken place between the secretary of state and the commissioner <e> <s> if they have not taken place is it not material that they should <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will pardon my going to the dispatch box again <e> <s> may i remind him that he answered my previous question with the rather original remark that the secretary of state was in constant consultation with the commissioner of the metropolitan police <e> <s> would he direct his mind to my specific question in view of the anxiety on this matter <e> <s> have special consultations taken place in regard to that portion of the report to which the noble lord lord avebury referred <e> <s> if not would he please tell the secretary of state his right honourable friend that a consultation of this kind is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all very grateful to the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> it is a little difficult to have to wait for the bill to have a passage throughout this house before proper words can be found to give this very essential definition <e> <s> but that is a matter for the noble lord lord howard to comment on since it is his amendment and not mine <e> <s> the only reason why i rise is that others have expressed precisely the same anxiety to me as was expressed by the noble lord lord winstanley i hope that in any exchange of correspondence that may take place with the noble lord <e> <s> lord winstanley on that matter i might be included <e>", "<cs> my lords in the midst of the discussion which took place on this very clause i ventured to make the suggestion on behalf of my noble friends which the noble lord the minister has very graciously adopted <e> <s> therefore i should like to thank him very much for having considered what we have said and for acceding to it <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were dealing with the ministers own amendment i ventured to remind him although i believe he needed no reminding of the debate which took place on this matter at committee stage <e> <s> it was as a result of that debate when we were considering the possible unfairness of a variation suddenly confronting a licence holder and on the other hand the necessity for a variation to be made in certain circumstances that i ventured the suggestion at the bottom of col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that i must ask the leave of the house even to make this intervention before the noble lord the minister sits down <e> <s> before he commits himself to the obligation possibly to remove the question of the period of the licence would he not agree that it might be the finding by way of experience that this period is either too long or too short <e> <s> would he want to bind himself and the authority so that in the light of experience they could not vary the period either way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble baroness for the way in which she has introduced this amendment and for the very courteous way too that she referred to the amendment that i moved at committee stage <e> <s> i remember that when the noble lord the minister indicated that he agreed in principle with what had been said but wished to consider the way in which this <e>", "<cs> my lords i had reserved what small contribution i had to make on behalf of my noble friends until after the minister had spoken because i feared that there might not have been the happy response to the amendment that there has been <e> <s> i believe that on all sides of the house we are delighted that the amendment has been accepted and that people who have the reputation which its movers have for being so much concerned with voluntary organisations have had an opportunity to persuade not only the minister but also this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the minister <e> <s> i want him to realise that we on this side appreciate that there may be difficulties in dealing with so many amendments in the comparatively short period between the committee stage and the report stage <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord for saying that the principle of this amendment is accepted by the government in general terms <e> <s> there is only one request i would make of the minister <e> <s> for the second time we have heard today i say this with all the understanding that i have previously expressed that an amendment which is a fairly important one may not come before your lordships before this bill leaves the house <e> <s> i believe that our revising duties are best carried out when we can if possible complete our task before a bill goes to another place <e> <s> that is especially true where a bill originates in this house <e> <s> i would therefore plead with the minister if it is humanly possible to produce an amendment by third reading in order that the bill leaves this place and is seen in another place properly revised by your lordships house that would be a favour to the house in general <e>", "<cs> my lords upon the understanding that i believe exists between the noble lord the minister and myself i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would ask most respectfully that your lordships regard this amendment as one of the most vital that we shall be considering in regard to this bill <e> <s> i doubt whether there is one member of your lordships house who has not got a duality of feeling about this bill <e> <s> the first feeling is that one does not want to try to do what king canute was asked to do which is to restrain the tide of development <e> <s> all of us feel that it would be wrong to say no cable <e> <s> we have seen what has happened elsewhere <e> <s> we feel it would be wrong to say no cable this is going to bring down the whole reputation of this country in broadcasting and is going to do an awful lot of harm in spite of the restrictions in this bill <e> <s> we do not want to adopt that attitude <e> <s> but at the same time if we do not adopt it and we allow slipshod language to go on to the statute book i believe if i may say so that we are not fulfilling our duty to ourselves or to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard that as a very fair question <e> <s> i shall tell the noble lord where my difficulty lay <e> <s> the earlier clause did at least provide a code to deal with violence and matters of that kind <e> <s> if i had proposed this amendment at that stage unfortunately it might have meant that i would have sacrificed the provisions dealing with violence and suchlike <e> <s> therefore i thought it better to table this amendment in order that the house would know categorically what the time period was for this code the limitation of this code to standards and the basis upon which the code was to be laid down namely that unless those standards as distinct from guidelines were reached no licence would be granted <e> <s> if this amendment is defeated as i hope it will not be at least i am left with the provision in the bill in clause which does something although in my judgment not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask for the leave of the house to be allowed to answer because i am permitted to speak only once <e> <s> however according to the noble lord lord mottistone who has very good eyesight i am still supposed to be on my feet and not to have resumed my seat <e> <s> the principle that i am trying to enunciate is different from that in clause <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers courteous but unsatisfactory reply i think that the house would wish to express its view <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to start by congratulating the noble lord lord campbell of alloway on the very tolerant way in which he accepted the arguments advanced against his amendment at committee stage <e> <s> there were those of us who advanced views in which we doubted whether the judges were competent people to decide upon matters of licences as between different applicants <e> <s> he has acknowledged that that is so and has withdrawn from the judiciary any such suggested duty making them merely a body of judicial review <e> <s> i am grateful as i said to him for giving consideration to the arguments which were put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i cannot remember the legislation to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> it strikes me as the sort of remark that i would have made and as the sort of support that i would have given but this is an entirely different matter <e> <s> to prove discrimination on the grounds of sex colour race religion or whatever ought to give the right of review but this is not at all that kind of case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is elegant in phrase and usually chooses when he uses a simile or metaphor a very appropriate one <e> <s> i therefore intend to follow him upon the thrice repeated simile of braces <e> <s> the principle which i am trying extremely hard to support and i believe that i have the sympathy of most parts of the house constitutes from my point of view a support for something without which this nation loses its dignity <e> <s> i cannot therefore think of anything more appropriate than to talk in terms of braces <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard the debate on this matter and i ask that the opinion of the house be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pretend to be elated by the reply from the noble lord the minister <e> <s> one of the anxieties that most of us have is that by unfair means the people who are supplying the cable programmes will be able to obtain an unfair advantage over independent television <e> <s> independent television is subjected to this very clause in spite of the fact that there is a code on advertising which has been agreed between the various parties <e> <s> advertisers will know that if they go to independent television they will be unable to do what they want to do by way of proffering prizes in order to induce people to buy goods <e> <s> so the chances are that they will go to cable instead of to independent television <e> <s> i look immediately at the noble lord lord hill of luton if he will forgive a glance from the dispatch box and i am immediately reminded of his warning that if we are not very careful we will not just be depreciating standards in cable television but depreciating standards in the two great existing bbc and independent television authorities <e> <s> therefore independent television through lack of money may either have inferior programmes as a result or may have to resort to other methods of inducing viewers and advertising back <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances and looking at the number in your lordships house it would be quite wrong for me to attempt to divide the house in order to test an opinion <e> <s> i reserve my right to deal with the matter at a later stage of the bill however much i regret having to carry amendments over to third reading <e> <s> but in the circumstances i must ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may the noble lord the minister take from this report stage today the definite and confident belief that i shall never consider him churlish that is the last thing in the world i would do <e> <s> what i do say however is this that having put the point of view i have on two occasions it seems to be churlish of me to push the matter further than i have done <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has considered the point and he has answered and i do not think this is a matter where one ought to divide the house <e> <s> i therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall add only a sentence or two if i may to tell the noble lord lord mottistone that he is very much more convincing with the moderate speech that he made today and that smile which gladdens the heart of every member of the house whenever he graces us by wearing it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to intervene at this stage to say merely that that would certainly suit my noble friends and myself for the following reason <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is always clear but of necessity he had to make a fairly rapid speech in explanation of his amendments <e> <s> we do not have notes on clauses when it comes to dealing with government amendments and personally i should like to consider what the noble lord has said in order that together with my noble friends i may intelligently contribute i hope to a discussion on what the noble lord the minister has explained <e> <s> it really needs reading and studying <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will have realised by now how united the house is in asking for action on this matter <e> <s> can he inform the house how far police inquiries have gone if indeed they have been made into investigating the origins of the people concerned in this matter <e> <s> also can he say whether or not the police have been informed that on the next hearing of this inquiry their presence is very much to be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is very gracious in mentioning that i was about to be elsewhere until i was persuaded that i must deal with this bill instead <e> <s> i only hope that the ending of this debate will not be quite so sad as as i remember is the end of la boheme <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the noble earl is not dealing with the main point i am making <e> <s> i was not on the question of onus of proof i was on the point that this is a matter which in the examples i have given would have to be ventilated before a criminal court <e> <s> the noble earl took the instance of prosecution by the crown or by the police and i shall come to the police in a moment <e> <s> what i am saying is that this would be a matter that would have to be ventilated as it is not at the moment and does not have to be before a magistrates court instead of it being very properly a civil matter as it now is <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying and i have already said it very clearly is that despite what i have said if because of the happenings of july and august it is felt that there should be an amendment to the law i am not saying that i think it is necessary then the proper way to deal with that would be by amending the criminal law act <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord that if ambassadors and diplomatic premises are entitled to that protection and parliament has said that they are and the criminal law act says that they are then i can see a very logical case for our royal palaces and if necessary downing street and possibly a few other addresses being accorded precisely the same protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord wants to be fair to me <e> <s> what i said was that the dreadful incidents of july and august were not due so much to a defect in our criminal law as to a grave defect in our security <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder if he would mind so that it is clearly on record in this debate dealing with the point which i tried to make about the difference between the first bill and the second bill <e> <s> the noble earl made it quite clear and he will deal with this himself i have no doubt that without the question of provoking fear and other items he mentioned there he would not have put this crime forward <e> <s> it cannot be an answer would the noble lord deal with this to say the question of reasonable excuse has taken over that need in this second bill because of course it was the defence that was clearly set out in clause of the first bill <e> <s> so this question of reasonable excuse and justification is not an additional item <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the house and the minister agree that the concluding question on this subject might well be to follow a recommendation of the wolfenden committee of which i was proud to be a member namely that smoking should only be allowed between consenting adults in private <e>", "<cs> my lords may one take it by virtue of the fact that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is dealing with this pnq and answer that he together with the law officers will be consulting on this matter and the very serious situation in regard to it <e> <s> may i also ask the noble and learned lord whether he would agree that the one positive contribution that could be made here is by the youth clubs of this land which at the present moment are getting very little support indeed and which very much need encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment as strongly as i possibly can <e> <s> the house will know that we are dealing now with people who see upon a screen and it is one screen matters which they feel treat then unjustly or unfairly or which invade their privacy <e> <s> as the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe said it was very late at night when we last discussed this matter <e> <s> the chief whip was hovering in the background waiting to ask that the committee at that late hour should adjourn <e> <s> the noble lord lord howard responded most courteously to the presence of the chief whip and said that this was a matter that he would prefer to deal with at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and of course with the permission of the house as i have already spoken i have said this before would not the noble lord the minister agree that it is the duty of this house if at all possible to see that legislation goes to the other place with the imprimatur of your lordships house upon it and the recommendations of your lordships house as accepted by the government finding their way into the bill before it reaches the other place especially when the bill originates in your lordships house <e> <s> in those circumstances i know the noble lord the minister well enough as do all his colleagues in this house to know that he will strain every effort to see that an amendment will in fact be before us before the third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister with the courtesy to which we have become accustomed so far as he is concerned did communicate with me did deal with the points i raised in committee and did so to my complete satisfaction <e> <s> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords may the house congratulate the noble viscount on his very learned comments relating to a most abstruse subject <e> <s> i think he would expect that we should study them rather carefully it is a little difficult to take them in after he enunciated them a moment or two ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that every member of the house on whichever side they may sit would want to thank the noble lord the minister in turn for his patience and courtesy and his tolerance of some long debates that have taken place on some of the matters in this bill <e> <s> if he thinks that his understanding was in any way lacking he is so astute that we did not notice it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for the explanation that he has given of the procedure <e> <s> i can well understand some of the difficulties involved <e> <s> however the fact is that there could well be an error in the warrant or an error relating to the matters contained in the warrant <e> <s> therefore i should like to have an opportunity to read very carefully what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> in the meantime <e>", "<cs> i now withdraw in favour of my noble friend lord melchett <e>", "<cs> i believe that it will be with the consent of even my noble friend lord melchett that at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> in doing so i should like to emphasise the points he has made so clearly and which i was trying hard to make during the course of my few remarks <e> <s> my noble friend with his usual care has made those points more clearly <e>", "<cs> there is one firm principle that one learns when dealing with a committee stage in your lordships house and that is that if a principle which one regards as an important principle is admitted by the government and there is an undertaking from so responsible a minister as the noble lord lord elton not only to look into it but even to come forward with something which is acceptable to the government then one immediately withdraws the amendment <e> <s> the only thing i say in addition to that if i may is that i welcomed the noble lords very courteous offer to have an exchange of views in regard to this <e> <s> i and i am sure i am speaking for other noble lords who have been associated with this amendment would be very happy if he thought that it was an appropriate course to hold a meeting on this matter in the hope that something could come out of that meeting which might take rather less time than correspondence <e> <s> in these circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept that completely <e>", "<cs> once again i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for having admitted the main principle of the amendment <e> <s> in the circumstances therefore i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister finally replies to the discussion i should like to put the following matter to him <e> <s> i can see unlike if he will forgive me my noble friend lord melchett the possibility of some intervening circumstance of a very weighty nature such as the noble lord the minister has indicated <e> <s> however that does not really affect the main principle of my argument <e> <s> although it does affect the way in which an amendment ought to be put <e>", "<cs> moreover i shall be able to cite the noble and learned lord as my authority for so saying <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure whether the fact that a noble lord is not present when i make a contribution to the committee however humble necessarily means that it is a contribution to which that noble lord would have listened even if he had been present <e> <s> but i can only say that that was the contribution i endeavoured to make myself in other words putting some words into the amendment at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i intend to remain the optimist that i am but i completely accept what the noble lord the minister has said and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i intervene only because i believe i shall be reprimanded if i am wrong that we are going a little astray <e> <s> and for once i believe that the noble lord the minister is responsible for our going a little astray and it is not like him at all <e> <s> it looks as though the debate is taking place upon this amendment with the minister concentrating not on those who may be transferred into this country but on those who may be transferred out of it <e> <s> i would ask him to look at the clause to which this amendment refers <e> <s> it is subsection on page and it provides specifically for the issue or non-issue of a warrant <e>", "<cs> i only want to correct myself if i may <e> <s> it is my normal habit as it is with all your lordships to confess immediately when i find i am wrong and i do that <e> <s> i had read subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> i have listened with the greatest care to what the noble lord the minister has said but i am in a state of some little confusion in respect of his remarks on religious institutions imposing a term of imprisonment as a result of religious law <e> <s> i thought that i caught the minister correctly in his very recent observation when he said that it would be a matter for interpretation by the courts <e> <s> if we were thinking in terms of the english courts i would be perfectly happy but all the examples anyone can think of relate to british subjects abroad who would not be receiving the benefit of a ruling by an english court and nor would the english courts ruling avail them <e>", "<cs> it was precisely because of that difficulty that i did not want the committee any more than the minister would want the committee to be under the impression from the ministers remarks that we can dismiss this amendment because without any doubt at all if ever we entered into an agreement with another country it would be obvious and they would have to agree to this that because of the wording of this bill religious convictions and sentences came under the banner of criminal jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> i am hoping that the noble lord the minister will be good enough at least to listen to the point that i wish to make on the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is of some concern to the national association for mental health <e> <s> i shall well understand it if he cannot give me a reply now but i would ask him whether he will with his usual courtesy write to me so that i can in turn assure the association that the matter has been given proper attention <e>", "<cs> again i should like to raise a point on the question whether the clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> clause deals with transfers out of the united kingdom <e> <s> the noble lord the minister may remember the anxiety expressed in some quarters about what would happen if a terrorist was convicted and sentenced for terrorism in this country and we had entered into an agreement with a country which might favour the type of terrorism for which that person was responsible or the so-called cause of terrorism that that person advocated <e> <s> the fear was that a sentence might prove absolutely nugatory because on a transfer abroad for all we know and in spite of provisions in the agreement there might be almost nursing-home treatment if not a heros welcome <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely true that i have down a further amendment to clause and it is more suitable that i move it before raising the other matter <e> <s> we have at least given the noble lord the minister an opportunity to consider what i have said when we come to consider whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i hope not to repeat it word for word <e>", "<cs> i said before that some interventions of my noble friend lord donaldson were most helpful <e> <s> his previous one was and this one quite obviously does not come within that description <e> <s> i thought i had made it clear and i apologise to your lordships as well as to the noble lord lord donaldson if i did not make it clear it must be my fault that if an international arrangement made it obligatory upon the united kingdom and therefore the secretary of state to impose a balance of a sentence which would exceed the maximum in this country if the offence had been committed here i immediately conceded that the secretary of state would have no alternative <e> <s> my complaint was that that was not a limitation that was put upon the secretary of states power and the bare fact would appear to be if the explanatory notes are right that irrespective of the international agreement making him do this he could do it himself <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he has said in regard principally to the first leg of the amendment <e> <s> as i indicated the two legs of the amendment should have been separated and i apologise to the committee for that <e> <s> i shall wait with great interest to see what the government put forward as a result of this amendment being tabled <e> <s> in regard to the second leg of the amendment i am again certainly grateful to the noble lord for the consideration that he proposes to give to it <e> <s> therefore in that respect too i await what he has to say <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have been caught out and rightly so for having earlier made a speech that ought to be made at this stage <e> <s> having committed that sin let me not commit the dual sin of repeating a speech and boring members of your lordships committee with it <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord the minister and the members of the committee listened to what i had to <e>", "<cs> i was comforted by what the noble lord the minister said and i would not interfere in any way at all with the reflection that he wishes to give to this matter <e> <s> i was of course not limiting myself by <e>", "<cs> i rise to make a few quick points on something which has been well ventilated <e> <s> i promise to make them as fresh points <e>", "<cs> in supporting what my noble friend has just said i should like to pay my tribute and i imagine that others would want to join with me to the fact that we have received a great deal of assistance from the national council for the welfare of prisoners abroad <e> <s> they have raised many points and given us a lot of data upon which we have brought amendments before your lordships this afternoon <e>", "<cs> may i merely say one sentence i hope the reasonableness of the noble lord the minister is but a precedent for things to come <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that in some parts of this house the feeling is that this matter cannot be shrugged off with general words <e> <s> will the minister accept that in some parts of this house this would <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing in this amendment with a proposal which was put forward by my noble friends and myself and by the noble lord lord wigoder and his friends at the committee stage <e> <s> it is repeated today from both benches and it is supported by no less a member of your lordships house than the noble lord lord shackleton whose report was viewed with the utmost interest and <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not dealing and i think perfectly fairly with what might happen when this matter reached a criminal court <e> <s> i left my observations as did the newspaper with what had happened to that man in regard to police inquiries <e> <s> in spite of the words reasonable excuse the matter has been referred according to this report and according to an ruc spokesman to the director of public prosecutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i will make only one intervention because i believe the house will be much more keen to hear what my noble friend lord shackleton has to say <e> <s> in the consideration of this matter and as i said to the house that i was not moving amendment no <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends because i thought this amendment was preferable and the opposition agreed with that view i would merely like to make a comment on the two points made by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> the first is that the government saw a difficulty if i understand him <e>", "<cs> my lords i tremble as i come to the dispatch box the thunder claps having sounded and the lightning having come across your lordships house as it does when the noble and learned lord lord denning in any matter of law delivers a judgment but sometimes of course your lordships house has seen fit to combat that thunder and that lightning and has reversed the noble and learned lords judgment in a court below <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i said that i merely sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble and learned lord lord denning was asking the leave of the house when he spoke again but he is always welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so whether the noble and learned lord lord denning speaks in order or whether he does not his voice is always welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon the question that was put by the noble lord lord avebury may i ask whether the noble lord the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister care to comment on the first half of my question which related to the horror with which most people heard of experiments with bullets on live animals <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the debate be unfortunate or not question time is meant for the very purpose that these questions are being asked <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister recollect his original reply to a very open question which was that contracts had not yet been signed <e> <s> would he agree that that gave the impression to the house that this matter was still under negotiation <e> <s> if the reply to the question was that contracts had not yet been signed is the noble lord saving that indeed what is confidential before a contract is signed is not confidential afterwards <e> <s> would he also be good enough to say quite openly to the house upon what independent guidance this price was fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to reply courteously to the noble viscount the leader of the house and say that i believe that most noble lords in this house would have wished that he could have <e>", "<cs> my lords to show the reasonableness of the opposition throughout this measure we have no objection to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to show consistency as well as reasonableness we have no objection to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make my position clear <e> <s> i cannot claim parentage of the amendments which led to this amendment but my noble friends and i claim to be members of the family who encouraged the birth <e> <s> i do not oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i would like to join with the noble lord lord winstanley in thanking the noble baroness for her part in obtaining this amendment which is very welcome <e> <s> the noble baroness described her contribution as inelegant <e> <s> may i assure her immediately that we never see her in that light nor do we ever so hear her <e> <s> mention by the noble lord of the deaf broadcasting campaign gave me much pleasure because their literature was substantial in nature and if i may say so very sensitive in content and it reached all of us who are interested in this matter <e> <s> my noble friends and i were delighted to support the noble lord lord winstanley when he moved his amendment and we are grateful to the government for having accepted it <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that i am disappointed with that reply despite the very kindly words which the noble lord the minister used at the end of his speech would be the understatement of the day <e> <s> i am hoping that in another place at this time certain more encouraging statements are being made on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hill of luton in the course of a very persuasive speech paid compliments to the noble lord the minister for his conduct of this bill throughout its proceedings <e> <s> i specially did not follow the noble lord lord hill in the eulogies which he was uttering at that time but only for one reason and that was that i did not want the noble lord the minister to think that i in moving my amendment about which i felt so deeply was using corrupt means in order to get him to accept it <e> <s> at this moment i wish that i had done so because at least it might have had some type of effect but knowing the noble lord the minister i doubt it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone is so kind to give way <e> <s> i only want to make it clear that that was a personal observation <e> <s> i have no authority to make it on behalf of my front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that one of the dangers of having very high fines is that there must be a temptation in some cases for the more wealthy to be fined because they can pay the fine whereas those who cannot afford it might have prison sentences imposed upon them <e> <s> would that not be a very undesirable situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships would recognise that any amendment especially in regard to this painful bill that we have to deal with that is supported by my noble friend lord shackleton deserves the rapt <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have heard with many emotions not least the emotion of sorrow the statement the noble and learned lord has just courteously repeated which has been made in another place by his right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> at the very outset may i make it perfectly clear if clarity is needed that my noble friends and i speaking on their behalf on this occasion will never uphold violence from whatever source it may come <e> <s> the history of trade unionism knows of violence <e> <s> this movement was born and had its chapters of growth built upon the fact that originally trade unionists fought against the violence which they and their children suffered <e> <s> so there is unanimity in all parts of the house in condemning violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a strong suspicion that the concluding words of the noble lord the minister constituted a strong hint that anyone who spoke from these benches should speak with the same brevity that he did and with the same clarity if one could copy his clarity which is exemplary <e> <s> i will try to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reflecting upon the answers that were given last time to the questions that were raised appreciate that there is anxiety in the house and generally that we are not hiding documents because we are ashamed of their contents or because we think that their contents might give arguments to those who are opposed to us on the title to the land in question <e> <s> will the minister therefore be more frank with the house and say whether there is any justification for that thought <e> <s> if there is not justification for it could not the documents be returned rather expeditiously to remove the rumour <e>", "<cs> my lords as the one who had the privilege on behalf of the opposition of moving this amendment may i simply express my thanks to the noble viscount and say that it was with very great joy that all of us heard the respect that is paid to the voice of this house <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept this amendment and i say that with all deference to the noble earl who moved it so persuasively <e> <s> i say that for the following reason <e> <s> it will be known that on second reading i ventured from a personal point of view to say that this bill in my judgment was not a necessary bill and i tried to give reasons for saying so <e> <s> your lordships did not accept the view that i put forward on that occasion <e> <s> your lordships did so as i understood it by saying that occupiers and the accent was on occupiers ought to be protected and even though the question of molestation vexation annoyance or whatever it was which had been in a previous bill before your lordships in a previous session was not in this bill your lordships took the view that it was necessary for the protection of people who were in occupation of premises and lawfully so as the owner the tenant or the licensee <e> <s> to increase the purview the area of the bill to include buildings under construction and then to have possible incursions into such buildings by the police who might be warned by other occupiers nearby who felt that somebody was wrongfully on the premises about to be constructed is really going much too far <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will not accept the amendment and i know that the noble earl will forgive me for differing from him <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not have the reputation of being a wrecker of this bill because as i have said <e> <s> i hope that my objections to it on second reading were reasoned objections <e> <s> i had quite a lot of sympathy with the noble earls inspiration to bring this bill before our lordships <e> <s> but again i utter a word of warning about extending the area of this bill beyond the area which this house would want it to cover <e> <s> it is one thing to say that we introduce a new crime into our criminal code when someone who has no right at all to enter our premises does so and refuses to go <e> <s> it is at least intelligible that one should have a crime of that order and that one should be able as a private citizen to call the police and as the noble lord lord renton said to initiate a private prosecution <e> <s> but it is entirely different if we are now again to walk into the area where somebody comes upon the premises perfectly legitimately and then the occupier takes the view that he is no longer welcome and the gentleman or lady concerned wishes to continue an argument which he or she has had with the occupier of the premises <e> <s> at that stage are we to have a new crime committed <e> <s> because that person does not leave when the occupier wants him to are we to add to our criminal code that a private prosecution can be brought and the police can be brought in <e>", "<cs> i give the noble lord the assurance that that is still so and will remain so until the end of all stages of this bill because this is not a political matter in the slightest <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton as one would expect of one of his eminence as a lawyer has correctly recited the civil law in regard to trespass <e> <s> we are dealing with criminal law here not the civil law <e>", "<cs> i rise to make two points <e> <s> at second reading i expressed a view that i had tried to summarise before and the noble lord lord renton correctly reminded the committee that i then expressed and made it very clear that i expressed a personal view on this bill <e> <s> the gravamen of my charge against the bill if i can put it that way is that it did not even include the words that were originally in the bill when it came before your lordships house on a previous occasion making it the essence that the intruder if i may so call him had caused annoyance trepidation and whatever it was <e>", "<cs> my lords before the questioning upon this important matter concludes will the minister care to make it quite clear that there was no imputation upon the sobriety of the noble lord lord winstanley when he said that every time the noble lord asked for a pint of beer it was a matter for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords the gratitude of what remains of this house at this hour and the sympathy of the house should go to my noble friend lord longford for two reasons first because we should express our gratitude to him for once more raising a matter which is of the utmost importance to us namely that of the state of our prisons and the reform of our prisons and the part that prison officers ought to play <e> <s> secondly our sympathy should go to him because this debate is taking place at such a late hour when it deserves a greater attendance and to be reported elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords in the review of this question which has caused such grave disquiet generally and certainly in this house will the noble and learned lord with his colleagues consider the possibility albeit with the difficulty of a lay inspector presiding over the tribunal of incorporating such tribunals among those where contempt of court would be a relevant matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl the minister thanks a noble member of this house who reads a very long question ought he not to accord the same courtesy to members of this house whatever side they sit on <e> <s> is it the governments intention to say that it is perfectly all right to preach war to children but not to preach peace <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble earl the minister for his very brief and concise reply <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that it is not just a question of semantics but that there is a misnomer in calling these people as the question does soccer supporters <e> <s> does he not agree also that they would be much more correctly called supporters of hooliganism and not of sport <e> <s> finally would he agree that one of the ways in which we can combat boredom among youth is to help with the youth clubs of this country much more substantially than we do for at the moment they are largely unsupported financially in the hope that young people will be induced to join youth clubs and be taught proper behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister take very much to heart the record of the dates which my noble friend lord lloyd of hampstead recited thereby robbing me of the opportunity of showing the house my own historical knowledge in this matter <e> <s> in taking those dates to heart is the minister aware that the copyright reform group consisting of all the organisations mainly concerned with copyright in various industries wrote to his right honourable friend the prime minister on th march calling her immediate attention to the fact that legislation is urgently needed in this field and that promises have not so far been fulfilled in regard to legislation <e> <s> finally is he aware that the two main concerns in the entertainment industry are unauthorised private recording both audio and video and point-to-point communication via satellite <e> <s> will he press upon those responsible for those matters the desirability of including legislation in the session that has already been mentioned namely <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the house or those members of the house who have been present at previous stages of this bill will know of the personal views which i expressed from this front bench and will not appreciate it if i repeat them <e> <s> i merely say with great respect to the noble earl and those who have supported him that i have regarded this as a mistaken bill for reasons as i have said which i have given beforehand <e> <s> but no doubt in another place they will have the opportunity of saying whether my view is agreed with or his and i pay my tribute to the very courteous way in which he has conducted his bill throughout its passage in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that a considerable concern has been expressed about the matter on which my noble friend lord longford has put his question and that that concern is very much the present worry of the organisation called women in prison <e> <s> is he aware that he is talking about the very part of the prison which was thought unfit for male prisoners even though some work has been done to it since <e> <s> is it not true that there are other parts of this prison available for women prisoners but which are not yet occupied <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the supplementary question that was put by my noble leader lord cledwyn and the fact that the minister with his usual frankness has told the house that he has to look into the question of whether there are sufficient facilities available for these prisoners and also whether there is suitable alternative accommodation for those prisoners who are not in need of top security does he think that it is right that an early statement should be made to the house <e> <s> it seems that perfectly understandably he has not had sufficient information to give the house on these terribly important matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances if the noble lord the minister cannot give a statement to the house within the next days does he consider it reasonable that another question should be put down on the same issue within or at the end of that period <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister consider asking the new water authorities to put at the top of their demands in view of his replies water water everywhere but not a chance to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has a deep respect and regard for the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> indeed had the opposition had the chance of passing to the noble lord a drink it would have been rather stronger than the water which was provided for him by one of his noble friends <e> <s> i too from these benches would like to pay a tribute to the honourable member for luton south who piloted this bill through another place and who indeed if i remember correctly sacrificed the position that he had as a parliamentary private secretary in order that he could be responsible for it <e> <s> possibly i shall be forgiven if i also ask the house to remember the efforts of my honourable friend mr wardell the member for gower who introduced or tried to introduce a very similar bill into the other place in december and who was met by a difficulty to which i shall venture to refer your lordships hereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finishes with that point in which we are all interested would he really suggest to this house that the sort of people who import and distribute the sort of material we are talking about would be members of a respectable industrial association <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister finally sits down may i thank him very sincerely for the way in which he has dealt with most of the major issues raised <e> <s> however there was one point which he did not deal with <e> <s> it is the question of exports and the fears i ventured to express about what this might do for our reputation abroad if we did not have classification of videos with encouragement for these nasty videos to go abroad instead of staying here <e>", "<cs> my lords i was the one who dared to suggest that may be altered to shall and as a result of that daring i had the treat that i always enjoy that is a dialogue with the noble and learned lord who will always teach me law and do it with great grace <e> <s> on that occasion we wondered whether the provision should not be clearly mandatory so that there it was beyond any peradventure and without any necessary reference to the books to which the noble and learned lord lord denning referred <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may remind the house at committee stage i mentioned the grave concern of the national association for mental health in regard to those who were suffering from some form of mental disorder <e> <s> their concern was two-fold first who would be consenting on their behalf and was there provision in the bill for persons to act on their behalf for such consent <e> <s> that has now been answered by the noble lord the minister in his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is clear that the secretary of state can appoint such a person and the power is now given <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it will be for the convenience of the house if such debate as takes place on this amendment also takes place on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i am in order but having said that i was going to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and certainly to no <e> <s> in the debate on amendment no <e> <s> can i spare your lordships another speech and another moving of amendment no <e> <s> by replying now on this amendment and i assure your lordships doing it very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were as able to say something to your lordships as the noble lord is able with such skill to say nothing to your lordships i would be much more persuasive than i am <e> <s> i wonder whether i can persuade the noble lord the minister to go some way with me on this matter <e> <s> i think he will find that it is quite right that there is nothing in this bill which makes it mandatory for the decision to be in writing <e> <s> indeed at col on th march this year when he was dealing with this amendment he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord avebury <e> <s> but i was concerned with the point that there could be cases and i believe that this was a matter raised by someone else in the discussion where in spite of the fact that that is contained in a convention the foreign state does not do it and one is simply left with communications between two foreign offices about the failure to comply with the convention <e> <s> by this amendment we want to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was trying to do it by stages <e> <s> i was saying that there should be no difficulty in that part of the amendment which refers to the statement in writing the communication of that statement <e> <s> then we reach the point where the minister cannot help us at the moment which is the question of stating reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords with what shred of optimism i am left with after those remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has conveyed a favour not only upon this house but upon the english language in having changed the old clause which was absolutely meaningless to the clause he now brings before us <e> <s> for that we are indebted to him <e> <s> the chief mischief which we were trying to get at in clarifying that clause was the very one of which the noble lord the minister has spoken namely that it would be untenable that we should be imposing upon someone who was brought back to this country a sentence of imprisonment which exceeded the maximum according to our own law for precisely the offence of which he has been convicted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a little difficulty because i do not like disagreeing with my noble friend at all and i certainly do not disagree with him as regards policy but as my name has been attached to this amendment i think i must make something quite clear <e> <s> i thought that what we were discussing and i was with my noble friend completely were cases where quite apart from the question of means it would be quite wrong and unreasonable for the secretary of state to charge the expenses of the travel <e> <s> we are speaking to an amendment <e> <s> i notice which is limited to the unreasonableness on the question of means and not the circumstances of the case to which the noble lord has addressed himself with considerable eloquence and feeling <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had the power to appoint the noble lord lord avebury to any ministry it would be a great pleasure to appoint him to many of them but i would not choose the foreign office or the diplomatic corps <e> <s> may i who in future will have to deal as he will with the secretary of state through his very able representative in this house and with officials of the home office say how much i have been moved in the past by their co-operation and help how i am absolutely overcome by the assistance that we have had on this occasion and how i look forward to many other home office bills where i shall have exactly the same co-operation from them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has indicated that his right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary has made representations to the libyan government <e> <s> will he kindly indicate to the house what response if any has been received by the libyan government to those representations <e>", "<cs> my lords from the libyan government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister having spoken i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what i fear is this <e> <s> if the minister is adopting the argument that not to give reasons makes it apparent that there is something which is of vital importance by way of security or for other reasons and that it would be a dangerous thing to do i fear that the result will be that the secretary of state will never give reasons <e> <s> once he does that and does it by custom if he fails to observe the custom there is the indication <e> <s> therefore there would be no way in which a prisoner could correct an error <e>", "<cs> my lords i get fonder and fonder of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i am sure i would not have had the initiative to put forward that suggestion as he did but of course in the circumstances i am more than happy to accept the undertaking of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> indeed i should like to express and i am sure i am speaking for all those associated with this amendment my deep gratitude to him for the way in which he has received it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is always an appropriate moment at which one very shortly expresses ones contentment or despair at a bill that goes from your lordships <e> <s> in this case we are happy to express our contentment i think from all parts of <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness the minister agree that the question and answer that we have had this afternoon in regard to belize is a reminder to the house of the plight of many millions of refugees through political causes in the world today <e> <s> are her majestys government prepared to take the initiative to see that the powers are called together the high commissioner being largely helpless in regard to the heavy task that he has to perform in order to see whether each of the great powers cannot make some contribution in regard to this problem which is a blot on the civilised world <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> may i at once from these benches express our sympathy to the parents of woman police constable fletcher <e> <s> it is so tragic that a promising young life should end in this way <e> <s> as i have already said we extend our deepest sympathy to her parents <e> <s> on behalf of the opposition may i add a word of sympathy also to those who were injured outside the peoples bureau in this barbarous incident and wish them i believe on behalf of all your lordships a speedy and complete recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for rising to speak again but this is a very grave matter <e> <s> i hope that the house will therefore forgive me if i just revert to two questions which the noble lord the minister in the first case misunderstood and in the second case if i may say so with deep respect did not answer <e> <s> first in no way did i suggest that the demonstration should have been banned <e> <s> what i asked was whether bearing in mind ones knowledge <e>", "<cs> there are occasions when i am convinced by the noble lord the minister and there <e>", "<cs> speaking i repeat in a personal capacity i was almost inclined not to speak at all after the noble lord lord jenkins because i thought that i might have more sympathy from the committee if i left his speech where it was and would therefore get many more votes for my amendment <e> <s> but so powerful was the plea of the noble lord the minister that i must reply to it <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> my grammar is very often wrong and i am obliged to him if on this occasion he has corrected it <e> <s> if the amendment fell merely because i had used the word for instead of the term by way of i believe the committee would have had some sympathy with me <e>", "<cs> occasionally it gives one a sense of pleasure to be able to tell a political opponent that he <e>", "<cs> i find myself in a personal difficulty with these amendments <e> <s> it is of course convenient to take the principle of both amendments namely the amendment moved by my noble friend lord jenkins and that of the noble lord lord buxton <e> <s> the first difficulty in which i find myself is that both noble lords when they spoke to this amendment and the noble lord lord monson have taken it for granted that precisely the same considerations apply to the bbc and the independent broadcasting authority in their adjudication of what is good taste and decency as will apply under the provisions of this bill in regard to the designated authority <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he permit me to ask him a question which i believe will help many of us <e> <s> having regard to the very prominent and eminent position he holds in this field is he prepared before report stage to encourage a memorandum from the two authorities as to what they would be prepared to do by way of classification <e> <s> that might help many of us <e>", "<cs> i hope that this backwards and forwards argument even if it is committee stage will cease so that at least it will be known when we are expressing individual opinions <e> <s> i therefore make it clear to my noble friend that these are individual opinions they are certainly not the opinions of everybody on this side of the committee <e> <s> i make that abundantly clear <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend lord houghton missed a point in this paragraph bearing in mind as i do the speech that he made on clause <e> <s> i wonder whether he noticed with his usual care that there is a difference and the difference is the word and which occurs in clause and the word or which occurs in clause <e> <s> therefore he is talking about the following <e> <s> for the exemption there has to be a record of an event for those who took part in the event or connected with those who did so <e> <s> if that stays there it is completely exempt <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement which was made by his right honourable and learned friend in another place <e> <s> may i say and i get no pleasure from it on behalf of my noble friends that in several respects we can only regard this statement as being unsatisfactory and incomplete in regard to incidents which have brought humiliation in their train so far as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will have appreciated the noble lords creation of metaphors <e> <s> first of all we went from needle and thread to surgery from surgery to intensive care from intensive care to parenthood and we ended up with the pathetic straits of some poor orphan <e> <s> but even <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be very tolerant with me in regard to a supplementary and allow me to seek this opportunity of asking what is being done about the extraordinary and terrible delays in naturalisation applications and immigration applications <e>", "<cs> my lords juries have been called many things by counsel in the course of a criminal trial or rather at the end of it largely dependent on whether they be counsel for the prosecution or counsel for the defence and on the verdict the jury has given <e> <s> but whatever else may be said in that connection the whole of our jury system is very much the clean stream of justice that flows through our land and one that deserves to be conserved with the greatest care <e> <s> as i see it that means that if that stream becomes sullied it is the duty of members of this house and of another place to look with the greatest care and see what is the cause of that admixture and try to purify the stream <e> <s> from that point of view i should have thought there would be no difference of opinion in any part of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that correction i should have said the nature of the sentence and not the nature of the crime <e> <s> in my view that is a correct principle and a better one than the one which was adopted in the previous legislative attempts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord does so and i know that he will respect what i am saying and if he disagrees with me he will say so i too saw sir patrick mayhew at that time and i understood from him that our discussions upon the bill and upon what might take place in legislation were to be deemed to be private which is why i personally did not refer to our meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is always courteous and jovial and we appreciate both dispositions <e> <s> however would he please take the point on board that there is nothing quite so hurtful as a right that one never appreciated before when one finds it has been withdrawn for some nefarious reason not the reason of being a member of the bar <e>", "<cs> in regard to what the noble lord has just said i wonder whether i might make just a couple of comments <e> <s> again i repeat to him and to the committee that i am expressing a personal point of view <e> <s> he said in regard to clause that it is a slur upon the video manufacturers of this country and indeed that the whole of the bill constitutes such a slur <e> <s> i felt that i ought at once to rise to say that i have before me a document issued by the british videogram association in regard to this bill <e> <s> it says proudly that it has members ranging from relatively small companies and it gives instances to the giants in the industry <e> <s> this is what it has to say about this bill which includes clause <e>", "<cs> we all listen with great respect to what the noble lord lord renton has to say <e> <s> i can recall past debates when i have always enjoyed listening to him <e> <s> he has with some strength made the debating point that if you find on one side people who say that the body has gone too far and on the other side people who say that the body has not gone far enough you can usually judge that you have got it just about right and i use his favourite phrase which i remember so well <e> <s> it is all very well to have an onslaught on the bbfc and to think in terms of not having it <e> <s> we have not said in the bill that it should be the bbfc <e> <s> this will have to be left to parliament and to another discussion in both houses i have no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please retain my sense of honour <e> <s> it was the london county council <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend will not mind if i intervene only for one moment since it may affect the whole tenor of his future remarks <e> <s> as i read it my noble friend may care to look at it again far from the words being verbiage declaratory or whatever other term which with a smile he cares to put upon them they are in fact mandatory <e> <s> they are words which say that the authority must have regard <e> <s> it may very well be that my noble friend has an even stronger argument as a result of that but at least i know that he would want to base his argument on correct facts and on correct interpretation <e>", "<cs> i knew something would go wrong if my noble friend lord jenkins supported me <e> <s> obviously i am most grateful to him for supporting me in principle <e> <s> although the meaning of this amendment is perfectly clear the precise wording of it may not be in accordance with what the minister with his expert guidance feels should be the case <e> <s> no one would be more happy than i to see that it was altered or if it was accepted in principle to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> of course i did know that to be the case judging from the declarations that were made in the other place by the noble lords honourable friend <e> <s> i sought to have this on the face of the bill for a reason that i can put very briefly so that the noble lord the minister can answer it if he has any objection to it being on the face of the bill <e> <s> it may be the intention that such an advisory council should be set up and that it will work with the designated authority <e> <s> that does not give it any permanence whatever and parliament it seems to me would have no power at all hereafter to enforce the appointment of the advisory council unless we had it in the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister would kindly give me his objection to it being included in the bill bearing in mind that the government intend to do it anyway i would naturally know better where i stand <e>", "<cs> obviously i do not want to take up a great deal of time over this but i am sure that other noble lords who are anxious about the personnel of the designated authority and the advice that they receive will feel for me and with me <e> <s> i am afraid i am not satisfied with the ministers answer when he merely refers me to clause <e>", "<cs> yes clause i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am not thinking of the draconian measure of sacking a designated authority because it has not appointed an advisory council when in fact the other advisory council may have ceased <e> <s> what i want to try to do is this <e> <s> it is not just to legislate for a very benevolent goverment in this respect and may i emphasis that only in this respect alone would i regard them as benevolent <e> <s> i am not thinking only in terms of this government and of the present right honourable and learned gentlemen who is the home secretary and the assistance that he has received so ably from the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> we are legislating and i think we want to see that the advisory council is there <e>", "<cs> over a period of a long time i think i have learned to differentiate from the intonation in the voice of the noble lord the minister between whether i and the rest of the committee can feel optimism from it or whether we ought to be pessimistic <e> <s> on this occasion i find myself in the middle of the two feelings <e> <s> upon that happy basis on a friday afternoon i beg to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers experience this afternoon in answering this question would he consider becoming redundant and applying for re-employment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord crawshaw for the way in which he introduced the second reading of this bill and for his light-handed touch in explaining its provisions and his own personal position in regard to supporting such a bill <e> <s> one feels that this is a bill and i speak personally since this is a private members bill which ought to have a second reading but there are some points which the house ought to bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord bruce of donington and at his request i beg leave to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that very helpful reply <e> <s> is he aware that the speech which was made to the institute of directors on th may by his honourable friend mr alex fletcher the minister responsible for corporate and consumer affairs was generally welcomed particularly when in the course of that speech he said that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might participate in this discussion nevertheless hoping that it will not be too long extended <e> <s> we are on an important point <e> <s> for myself i can see advantages and it may well be that the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and the minister might care to consider this in seeing that the proliferation of ages to which the noble lord lord monson referred is undesirable and that one could have a situation i know it may be unlikely in which the designated authority may decide that for

bill by a statutory instrument to vary those ages <e> <s> there would not be any great difficulty in relation to that <e>", "<cs> my lords this house is often fortunate in having motions introduced and participated in by way of debate by those who have special experience <e> <s> tonight is no exception <e> <s> my noble friend lord wells-pestell quite apart from performing a great public service by bringing this matter before the house has done so with the experience of which he spoke and of which his noble freinds and other members of this house are well aware <e> <s> i think we were all touched by the contribution of my noble friend lord rhodes <e> <s> in the course of his distinguished and long career he has most likely heard the phrase what manchester did yesterday the rest of the

be able to bring a fresh point to your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the anxieties that have been expressed in several quarters of the house about our embassy in moscow and the care that was taken can the noble baroness assure the house that a very full and detailed report has been received as to all these matters including the opportunities that the embassy had <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might be allowed to add a word or two while my noble friend remains speechless in the hope that he will also be in the unusual condition of being content in regard to this bill <e> <s> if one deals with this practically as i know that my noble friend lord houghton wants to do this is the situation <e> <s> any police officer any person reporting the matter for prosecution any counsel for the prosecution if a prosecution eventually takes place will have to open his case as a matter of practicality by saying that the person concerned was either dealing under clause or in possession under clause on the basis of an article that was not classified furthermore that he was not exempt under clause and that on the evidence of the prosecution or on any matter properly placed before the court as evidence he could not reasonably have thought there was exemption <e> <s> it would then be for the defendant to say <e> <s> i have got a <e>", "<cs> i venture to say that what the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has just said constitutes rather a dangerous precedent if it be followed <e> <s> indeed it is only for that reason that i rise to my feet and find myself supporting the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord houghton and supported by my noble friend lord jenkins <e> <s> it would be extremely dangerous if ever we in parliament used the excuse that because crown courts are crowded therefore the very elementary just and traditional right of trial by jury should for that reason and that reason alone or even because it was an accompanying reason be denied <e> <s> we are all speaking personally in this debate and i cannot personally ally myself with any such consideration <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord the minister would never mislead the committee his reputation is much too good <e> <s> but if there were an appeal from a summary matter it would not come before a jury <e> <s> that is my belief and i think that i am correct in saying that <e> <s> i have obtained approval from a certain quarter at whom i am not supposed to look but i did so out of concern to see whether i was in fact right <e> <s> therefore there would be no chance of a trial by jury <e> <s> i know that the noble lord the minister would want me to make that perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has done that for me on many occasions in just as kindly a way <e> <s> there is a very short point here but i think that it is one of principle <e> <s> if trial by jury is given as a matter of right i do not think that it would hold up the passage of the bill <e>

should have been <e>", "<cs> i promise to detain the committee for one minute and one minute only and then i shall <e>", "<cs> it is only because i do not want anyone north of the border superior

in this bill will know that it is completely lacking in <e>", "<cs> i must intervene immediately to tell my noble friend that i had not read this provision in the same way as he did <e> <s> i thought that it was put in deliberately by this government in anticipation of a labour government coming to office where the value of money would have increased <e> <s> therefore it gives power to a future labour government having increased the value of money to minimise the penalties charged under this bill <e> <s> i read it quite differently and therefore i hope that he will at once agree to remove withdraw and expunge his amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to enter into this discussion because it is only right that there should be an authoritative reply and not one from me <e> <s> but to emphasise how it is that we are all expressing personal opinions may i beg to differ from my noble friends in regard to this amendment for two short reasons <e> <s> first of all parliament was either right or wrong to give an appointed justice of the peace by his or her decision the right not only to convict of quite serious offences but also to send citizens to prison <e> <s> that right was given as a result of our faith in their judgment and impartiality <e> <s> parliament was either right or wrong about that <e> <s> if parliament was right about that then is not a justice of the peace able to be trusted to make a decision about the question of search of premises <e> <s> in my view that must be right <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried about this and i believe that other noble lords are too <e> <s> i am just wondering where we are going <e> <s> the police and criminal evidence bill is one of the most serious and important bills in regard to the liberty of the subject and the powers of the police that will ever have come before parliament <e> <s> if it is debated by this house now that it has come to this house and i have no doubt each of its clauses examined with it is to be hoped a very full house in attendance is it right and proper that we should insert this clause in this bill so that it can be argued that this house and indeed parliament in regard to a comparatively minor measure have passed a power in this clause which can be quoted to us as a precedent that this house has <e>", "<cs> i am right i think in saying to the committee i almost used the words very humbly but i am reminded of what the noble lord lord houghton said when he said that he had not yet met a humble lawyer so i had better not employ that phrase that we have to be extremely wary <e> <s> there is another side to this coin <e> <s> is it right and this is a small committee to consider such an important point of principle that we should give an officer the power to come up to any citizen indeed any stranger to our country and he may have a right in regard to certain restrictions on entry to do it and say to him i demand that you give me your name and address <e> <s> it is something that we have been very wary about <e>", "<cs> i will try if i may to abbreviate the discussion not only to help your lordships committee but also to see that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby obeys the dictates of his gracious wife and is able to leave as he said he had been instructed to do at a reasonable hour <e> <s> this is the short title of a bill of parliament <e> <s> it is not suggested that any short title encompasses all the things that a bill is supposed to do <e> <s> what the short title does is to give an indication of what the bill is about and this bill is about video recordings <e> <s> therefore it is an extremely accurate and uncontroversial title <e> <s> once you start putting other words in it you walk into controversy or you walk at the very best from the point of view of those who support such an argument into one part of the bill which many of us feel is possibly not the most important part <e> <s> in those circumstances i think it is the general parliamentary practice in relation to the short title to do what i have just indicated and i hope that we shall follow that practice without further ado <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble lord to refer to clause <e>", "<cs> i again intervene briefly and in the expectation i hope not too optimistic that the noble lord lord monson will feel content that the amendment not to be moved by the noble lord

is intended to do <e> <s> what <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of what many of us thought was a most creditable first performance from the dispatch box the noble earl lord caithness asked us to envisage at least the possibility that the scaffolding in this roof might fall upon us <e> <s> if that is a fate that has to befall your lordships house i am so glad that it did not occur before the noble lord lord meston made his notable maiden speech <e> <s> it is a pleasure for a professional colleague to congratulate upon his maiden speech someone who is a barrister and <e> <s> if i may say so the son of a very reputed and notable lawyer whose publications indeed included commentaries upon many acts of parliament which have helped fellow practitioners understand them all the better <e> <s> to hear a son follow in his fathers footsteps and speak from his own experience at the bar for the benefit of your lordships house on this bill was a pleasure that we look forward to being repeated many times in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon earlier questions relating to the availability of clinics is the noble lord aware of an article which appeared in the <e>", "<cs>

must be few countries in the world there must be few legislatures which having suffered so much from terrorism would even stomach a motion of this kind and have a civilised debate about whether or not it is more humane to send some of the terrorists back to northern ireland where their families live <e> <s> it is delightful always to listen to the noble lord lord hylton because he has a reputation in this house for great humanity and the fact that people may differ from him in this debate in no way lessens the tribute we would always want to pay to him <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but if the noble earl will look at the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that immediately <e> <s> it so happens that the other companions on my bench also must have misheard the noble earl <e> <s> i accept immediately that he did not say those words if he said he did not or if he did say them that he never meant them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i accept that completely <e> <s> to get a situation of some realism it may well be that odoherty is one of those cases which should be considered within the principle i am about to enunciate and it is not a very original one <e> <s> if the newspaper reports that i have are right and they are newspaper reports which are seeking in the message that the newspapers are giving in ireland to get repatriation this is how one newspaper described what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to study his history which i know is the history of a man who is now and studying for a degree at the open university <e> <s> i know that he has said he has joined a religious order that he is extremely sorry for what happened and that he does not regard his offences as political offences <e> <s> that is what i read and that is what i have studied <e>",

order that i might make a better speech to your lordships than i shall be making <e> <s> i assure your lordships that it will not be half as amusing as it would have been if only those notes had reached me <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot leave definitions of that kind in this bill so there is a great deal to be done at committee stage <e> <s> i am going to end this address to which your lordships have been courteous enough to listen by quoting the end sentence of the philips report <e> <s> it reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to apologise to your lordships for the garb i

am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords while walking from my seat to the dispatch box i have indeed reflected <e> <s> i must tell your lordships that i am extremely unhappy that exports will not be covered by the bill <e> <s> the noble lord with his usual courtesy was answering the arguments and said that they were fairly and reasonably presented <e> <s> so were the answers of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> but i must tell him in all frankness that i found them unconvincing except when he talked to me and to your lordships about the risks that there might be to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could assist my noble friend in order that we may proceed though not with undue rapidity for there are material points to be made <e> <s> i see nothing in this bill and i stand to be corrected which says that the designated authority has to carry out any examination at all <e> <s> the duties of the designated authority are set out in clause <e> <s> all that they have to do is to determine for the purposes of this act whether or not video works are suitable for classification <e> <s> quite obviously the designated authority will not be anxious to give itself unnecessary work especially at the commencement and if acting at all intelligently what it will do is to say there has been a classification in the past <e> <s> what we will do is not to give it a similar classification because there may be differences in classification but to use the words possibly a similarly appropriate classification <e> <s> that quite obviously would be done <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene only to be helpful i hope i personally if i may respectfully say so agree with every word of what the government chief whip has said <e> <s> i think that what we want to achieve is one debate on the whole issue of whether or not this should be limited to licensed sex shops and as my noble friend lord jenkins said there are alternative ways of looking at this <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add a plea if i may and i do it in all frankness <e> <s> there has been a complaint made as it were by my noble friend lord houghton that there are some local authorities indeed in scotland northern ireland and my own very dear county of hampshire which have decided that there should in fact be no sex shops <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks me to come come <e>

they are automatic i would remind him that to try to take any decision of a democratic nature at twenty minutes to one in the morning with a diminished house is hardly a way to test opinion in a division lobby <e> <s> but the directly-elected representatives of the people decided by that -odd votes that this is the provision that they wanted in the bill and that they did not want these r films to be procurable in any place other than licensed sex shops <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house and before my noble friend takes his very honoured seat i say only this to him <e> <s> i do not impose any lecture upon him <e> <s> i merely talk to him as one colleague to another and i hope with due respect <e> <s> if a democratic decision upon this issue is really wanted my noble friend has a completely obvious task it is to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me to finish i shall give way <e> <s> the task is not to try to impose a division at this time with this meagre number and with the obvious result but to withdraw at this stage and bring it forward if he wishes at third reading at a respectable hour and with noble lords present who could not be present at am only because they do not have the agility of my noble friend even though they may be considerably younger <e>", "<cs> i immediately rise only so that the noble lord shall never think me discourteous <e> <s> my noble friend was merely asking me to expatiate on something that the noble lord had said <e> <s> i therefore did so in order to help him <e>

those circumstances it seems to me wrong if i may be allowed to say so that a matter of this importance should be decided at this moment <e> <s> it is for that reason that i propose to ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment and to raise this matter again when i hope that it will be discussed rather more fully although i appreciate the attention which the noble lord lord renton paid to the arguments that were advanced <e>", "<cs> may i put something right and thank the noble lord lord wigoder for his very able support on this amendment as indeed on the last one <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord renton would not wish to attach too much seriousness to the last observation that he made <e> <s> it is a relevant consideration not to include those who have had fines administered by the court against them <e> <s> he would be in a grave difficulty to fix the amount of the fine that would be caught <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would permit me to raise a point of order and ask for his assistance <e> <s> what he has just asked the noble lord lord renton to move would not exclude the report stage of this bill would it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that in this question he is dealing with a case which many of us consider to be an absolute scandal and a blot upon our administration of justice <e> <s> if he agrees with that description would he not agree that this is eminently a case for an inquiry <e> <s> is he aware that the very bill he quoted has led to discussions in this house about the nature of interviews and the danger in regard to interviews without legal representatives and with long periods of detention <e> <s> lastly is he aware that although a letter on this matter was sent by the secretary general of mencap to his right honourable friend the secretary of state on th april this year with a reminder the secretary of state has not yet had the courtesy to reply <e>",

supposed to be responsible on my noble and much respected friend lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> if he will do me the courtesy of reading <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely gratuitous of my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i much appreciate it and i promise to be extremely brief <e> <s> this matter was argued very cogently at the committee stage and the committee was extremely impressed not with the speech that i made but with the contribution that i remember was made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> the whole purpose of this amendment is to give the right of trial by jury in regard to offences which are very serious and which quite obviously register against the good name of any person convicted <e> <s> the main reason behind the giving of the opportunity for a jury trial was because of the provisions of this bill and i am looking at clause dealing with offences and penalties where in subsection the defence is stated to a charge of committing an offence under this clause by proving that an accused believed on reasonable grounds that various matters had occurred <e> <s> they are set out in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask for permission to speak again but what i am in fact doing as noble lords will appreciate is to abbreviate the proceedings because my amendment worded slightly differently follows upon the amendment of my noble friend lord houghton <e> <s> i am therefore trying hard to make one debate of it and not two <e> <s> therefore i ask for your lordships leave <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with great deference to the right reverend prelate i am really amazed at his contribution to this debate having valued so much his contributions to many other debates and especially on this bill <e> <s> my amazement if i may say so extends to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> the precedents and provisions that he has referred to which i freely admit i have had no opportunity of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful to the noble lord the minister for intervening <e> <s> usually it is a very helpful intervention <e> <s> i know that he meant that one to be helpful as well <e> <s> frankly it was not <e> <s> if he looks at clause of the police and criminal evidence bill he will find i was trying awfully hard not to take longer than necessary but it is not my fault if he refers to another part of the bill it has a very important safeguard <e> <s> quite apart from the reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed or attempted or is being committed or attempted a constable <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i do understand <e> <s> i answer the point by saying that it is first unjust that this bill will be running one assumes one cannot assume otherwise before the police and criminal evidence bill receives royal assent and therefore this power would be exercisable <e> <s> the proper way to deal with this is not to have any such provision in this bill at all but to leave things until the police and criminal evidence bill is considered <e> <s> then if both houses of parliament have passed it it is absolutely proper that it should apply to this bill <e> <s> but this is putting the cart before the horse a cart if i may say so that traverses a wrong ground in regard to the whole of our civil liberties and law as it stands at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble lord made the point before i sat down therefore that gives me the right to continue to speak <e> <s> i was using shorthand i hope with your lordships approval without going into great detail at this hour and i was doing it for this reason <e> <s> this bill deals with the whole of the question of classification <e> <s> therefore if there are found in the possession of anybody

often enough that my noble friends and i are and always will be strong adherents of law and order but equally my noble friends and i regard ourselves as having the duty to be very vigilant about an excess of police powers and very vigilant about the rights of citizens <e> <s> does not the minister agree that in that context we all of us have grounds for the gravest concern in regard to <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole of the discussion on this rather worrying matter must be against the background of the warning given by the noble and learned lord lord scarman in this house only last week that the boundary line between the use of police powers in a democratic state and a police state itself is a boundary line which is very thin <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that the principle enunciated by his noble friend lady macleod who usually voices very welcome principles in this house is a little dangerous <e> <s> does he agree that if we are dealing with things which can harm young people to keep silent upon them because young people might wish to be rather difficult and do just the opposite would lead us to no action at all <e> <s> in the circumstances does he think that to encourage some programmes on the media pointing out how dangerous this habit can be to young people might be a useful addition to the measures which he has announced to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing in the world i want to do is to interfere with the pious intention of my noble friend lord houghton that this stage of the bill should be completed during this dinner hour <e> <s> but in sheer frankness i must rise because i do not think that the right reverend prelate has quite got the point nor do i believe that the minister has <e>",

honourable friend the leader of the opposition in another place said after looking at those scenes horrifying untypical and un-british <e>", "<cs> on this occasion the addition is not difficult <e>

not continue to exaggerate <e>", "<cs> my lords on a friday afternoon your lordships have been treated not to a meal but to a feast of robust advocacy <e> <s> i honestly believe that if the noble and

the noble lord the minister made and i think that it has affected some of our minds <e> <s> in regard to dealing with the fear that we have that police officers may be constrained by the wrong motives when dealing with those of a certain colour or a certain eccentric appearance the noble lord said that if we looked later into the amendments we would find that the government had now put down an amendment which deals with a code of practice which covers the very clause that we are talking about <e> <s> the noble lord the minister and other noble lords will know that we have put down an amendment calling for such a code of practice it being i believe amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am impressed by the fact that following upon that amendment and an undertaking to look at this when it came to your lordships house that undertaking having been given in another place this code of practice is to be set up <e>", "<cs> may the gratitude be reciprocated from this side of the chamber to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he has been most gracious and i am glad that we have at an early stage succeeded for a second time now in improving this bill <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord the minister has been wrongly advised because amendment no <e> <s> deals with <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has admitted it graciously <e>", "<cs> i wonder if with the patience of the committee i could just answer a point <e> <s> i find that increasingly i welcome the interventions of the noble lord lord plant because his interventions may persuade the rest of the committee that what i have said may be right <e> <s> i say it for this reason <e> <s> to quote examples of huge demonstrations at football grounds may be to deal with the question of stopping somebody but we are dealing with the exercise of a power to stop and search <e> <s> if somebody has been stopped and searched he deserves a record whether he is in fact one of or people although it would be unlikely that as many as that would at any time be searched and certainly not by one officer <e>", "<cs> as that question has been directed to me i want to answer it otherwise the debate may not be as tidy as it should be and i apologise to my noble friend for insisting upon making the point now <e> <s> the noble lord the minister whose clarity of mind we always admire has not shown it on this occasion <e> <s> i was not making the point about being able to make a record in the midst of rain nor was i making the point that an officer should be able to make a record even if it was not raining if he was trying to deal with a troublous situation in brighton or elsewhere <e> <s> what i was saying and the bill says it is that it should be done some time afterwards if he cannot make it at the time and i know the noble lord will bear in mind that his saving statements do not apply to the other things he has got to do willy-nilly <e> <s> he has got to identify himself and to give his number under the provisions of this bill whatever be the circumstances <e> <s> he has to do other things <e> <s> there is no exception there if it is impracticable to do so <e>", "<cs> i am still puzzled and for this reason <e> <s> take the exaggerated example of one police officer who has searched people in this incident <e> <s> i would say he immediately deserves promotion if he has carried that out in connection with one incident unassisted <e> <s> but taking for granted that is so all he has to do is to say to each person whom he searches before searching him i cant make a record now but i will subsequently <e> <s> he goes back to the police station and i was going through it <e> <s> he says i was not able to identify all the can i make it instead of <e> <s> all the people whom i did search <e> <s> the object was obviously because i thought they had <e>", "<cs> i must not detain the committee much longer on this although it is a very important matter <e> <s> if the noble lord refers the committee to subsection of clause and asks if he does not know the name what can he do because he will be difficult to describe <e> <s> i must point out that the subsection reads <e>", "<cs> it is obviously a matter which ought to be looked at on both sides and not hurried <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has been very courteous especially in his last remarks and i would therefore ask him whether he would kindly agree to consider <e> <s> i promise that i will <e> <s> i think that with the help which he has and which i do not have he may get over more difficulties than i can and we shall then arrive at a proper solution to this problem <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson always helps me <e> <s> i am grateful <e> <s> he was not thinking in

moved to delete paragraph <e>", "<cs> can i help <e> <s> i will do so with the greatest of pleasure because this will help to abbreviate the proceedings and we are all anxious to do that <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister in his kindness will go on to deal with the question of financial loss as well as gain i will then answer him <e> <s> but i hope he will realise that there are two separate points <e> <s> one may fail on one one may win on both <e> <s> but one may also lose on both and maybe this will be dealt with at another time in the bill <e> <s> but if the noble lord wants to make one debate of it <e> <s> i am not going to stop him <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt at all if i may say so in all humility that the words in paragraph <e>", "<cs> that too is a matter of guesswork and that is why it cannot stand <e> <s> the noble lord the minister dealt with the fact that there is a precedent and that judges have to look at this sort of thing when sentencing and so on <e> <s> this is an entirely different matter <e> <s> this is a police officer having to make a judgment <e> <s> i do not even know since there is no guidance on financial gain such as there is in subsection on financial loss whether the substantial gain has to relate to the means of the person who got it or whether it has to relate to the person who loses what the other person has gained <e> <s> i just do not know <e> <s> in other words are we saying that if you happen to be a millionaire in the city and there is a gain of only million it cannot possibly be deemed to be substantial because of your other wealth <e> <s> and does it mean in regard to some poor man who is on a weekly salary of let us say or a week that if he gets the equivalent of one weeks salary as a result of his evildoing it is not substantial from his point of view <e> <s> what is the yardstick <e> <s> what is the guide <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i shall waste no further time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw in regard to both paragraph <e>", "<cs> look at clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that rhetoric even when it comes from my noble friend whose rhetoric is so powerful will get us anywhere <e> <s> the use of superlatives and exaggerated language really will not help us <e> <s> those of us who support the bill are said to be not realistic that we do not understand people who engage in conversations and transactions over the garden fence that we do not understand our neighbours or what happens in the real world <e> <s> as one who prides himself as living in the real world understanding it and very often seeing people with real problems i am going to tell my noble friend that i regard it as possibly the figment of a lewis carroll imagination or somebody like him to picture the scene that my noble friend asks us to picture in terms of the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends comments are always welcome and he knows it even if on some occasions they are extended in time <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two matters on which i at once want to express my sympathy with the two noble lords who have already spoken in support of this amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat speeches that i made before <e> <s> they may not even have been acceptable in their original form and they would become far less acceptable if repeated <e> <s> but i did say and i repeat shortly now that i have the greatest of sympathy with those who say that the matters dealt with in this bill are of such consequence that in a proper way they should have formed a government bill which we could have properly discussed without the threat of the bill being lost if we introduced anything like a major amendment <e> <s> i have the utmost sympathy with that point of view and i say so at once <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house it is very comforting to know that one individual speaking from this front bench individually is agreeing with another and very noble lord the minister sitting on another front bench but speaking officially <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a word or two if only because of the as usual useful contribution of the noble lord lord monson although it is one i do not accept <e> <s> we ought to bear in mind the arguments that have already been advanced as to the setting up of this machinery and what we want to do by way of classification <e> <s> i do not want to repeat the arguments but merely remind the house of the safeguards that are already in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise not to speak for long <e> <s> i join in the tributes that have been paid <e> <s> the noble lord the minister and the noble lord lord nugent know my views about the question of the omission of exports from this bill <e> <s> i want to do something nobody else has done <e> <s> i want to pay a tribute to my noble friend lord houghton with whose views i disagree and the noble lords lord jenkins and lord mcintosh and they know i disagree with their views <e> <s> what they have been able to do is this <e> <s> instead of their having a nightmare in future that this bill did not take many hours in this house and had not much discussion over each clause they will have the pleasant dream in future of knowing how their contributions have made it possible for all to say that this bill has been well considered and ought now to go to another place and he put on the statute book <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way for one moment <e> <s> i intervene only to encourage him to go on with his speech at greater length because the longer he speaks the more i feel that the committee will welcome the first amendment <e> <s> but having said that may i ask him whether he will kindly deal just for one momentwith his refusal to accept the possibility of an election in which the voters will be able to express their point of view instead of listening to his eloquence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord broxbourne has challenged me by a question <e> <s> may i first thank him for his courteous reference to me which if i may say so was rather more acceptable than the description of me which the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls gave to the committee <e> <s> whenever i had the privilege of instructing the noble lord lord broxbourne he always dealt with the facts of the case with remarkable clarity and did not put before the court any hypothesis which was unnecessary <e> <s> unfortunately he has done that today <e> <s> we are not dealing with this matter at all but if he asks me a straight question i give him the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficult tasks of the house is to find different words with which to express our gratitude sincerely to the noble baroness lady faithfull on the many occasions on which we do so <e> <s> this is a further such occasion and i wish to thank her most heartily and to thank the minister for his unfailing courtesy to which we are absolutely accustomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether upon that motion i may be permitted to raise one point against the background of which we shall be considering amendments generally and this bill in so far as we can on this occasion <e> <s> the secretary of state for the home department in the other place and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in this house both intimated i am sure they had complete belief in what they said that it was not possible to ratify the convention until legislation had been passed by parliament and the machinery of that legislation had been put into force <e> <s> for that reason there was a period of two years delay apart from anything else as we understood it for the convention to be signed <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister and i am very glad that his observations are now on record <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for his comments <e> <s> i have nothing additional to say <e>", "<cs> my lords the last thing in the world i want to do on a friday morning is to repeat in other words the points so well made by other speakers <e> <s> i therefore do not intend to do that but i want to say from these benches that we certainly support the principle and the spirit behind this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it looks as though the noble lord is now going on to a separate point <e> <s> before he leaves this one could he give the house an undertaking which is the one that i really asked for that if there is an overlap such as he suggested the higher principles of protection will apply in regard to that overlap in any regulations that are made <e>", "<cs> and i my lords in turn have the pleasure of thanking the noble lord for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has helpfully given an undertaking <e> <s> personally i felt that there was some technical difficulty not because of any wisdom of mine or any knowledge of the legislation but because rumour had reached me that there was a technical difficulty <e> <s> therefore i thought the practical way to deal with it was to see that advantage was obtained from the noble baronesss contribution to this debate and her amendment by getting the undertaking as to overlap and the higher protection that will be given under any regulations which are going to be made <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has very courteously conceded that point and has said that such an undertaking can be given and that the regulations will be so worded <e>", "<cs> my lords i will resist the temptation to refer to the various copies of the official report covering the discussions on this matter in the course of the bill <e> <s> i am pleased to see this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for his very courteous reference to the contribution i made in regard to this on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> i am delighted to see this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can help me <e> <s> is this a convenient moment to deal with the question of raw marks on examination papers <e> <s> he has dealt with clause no <e> <s> but if the minister feels that this is not a convenient moment and that another moment may be more convenient for him i will sit down <e> <s> i think he knows the point i am going to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again tempted to refer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord the minister knows there are bodies which feel that the exemptions in respect of payrolls and accounts have been substantially extended by this amendment <e> <s> he may also know that the trades union congress has made certain representations in this connection <e> <s> however i need not worry him any further in that regard because i am aware that their submissions are known to the government <e> <s> i do not think that i should have much success if i endeavoured at this stage to do anything about this amendment but i thought it only proper to put that on record in view of the observations that the noble lord made about the possible general acceptability of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember well my reference to cricket and the schoolboy <e> <s> if only i had had an opportunity yesterday afternoon of making any reference to cricket i should have done it with a smile on my face and happiness at englands score <e> <s> by virtue of my duty to your lordships house i am unable to see or know whether that success has been maintained <e> <s> i shall therefore sit down without further comment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i resist the temptation to bore the house with an excerpt from a speech that i made at an earlier stage <e> <s> i am delighted to see the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may say so in another capacity the legal profession are very pleased with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is rather a fun amendment in many ways <e> <s> by virtue of the fact that i am now told that the technical subject with which we are dealing is that of raw marks <e> <s> there was a time when i could talk on behalf of my children but i can now talk on behalf of my grandchildren and tell your lordships who are also in the same position of being grandparents that there are many occasions upon which grandchildren have described the marks they have recieved as raw marks <e> <s> however it is not this definition with which we are dealing today <e> <s> it is the question of marks which are possibly preliminary marks and not final marks <e> <s> therefore the right of access to these is a matter of obvious concern to examiners and might be of more obvious concern to students <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches were associated with the noble lord lord avebury in our strong recommendation of some such amendment as this <e> <s> therefore we are all delighted to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand why the noble lord the minister does not wish to dilate upon this matter in view of the pressure he was under at a former stage of this bill to agree to a statutory code of practice and if he did not agree to that at least to try to make it more likely that a code of practice would in fact ensue <e> <s> there is not a statutory code of practice under this amendment but at least the registrar is put under certain duties here in regard to encouragement of codes of practice and naturally we welcome a compromise achieved in the commons which we could not achieve in the lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to such a warm series of words obviously it would be appropriate for me standing where i do to thank the noble lord the minister and indeed members in all parts of this house who have co-operated on such an extremely difficult bill <e> <s> i hope that at the end of it we really understand it <e> <s> nevertheless we have done our best and possibly my last comment today being the day <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord proceeds to embellish that remark could i perhaps help him i hope by saying that it was not my point that the code might cover other things <e> <s> it was my point that the statute must lay down what the code should or should not contain <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord the minister will bear in mind that there is also the power to issue new codes and therefore the fact that a current code may although it is not in the act cover something an amended code may not do so <e> <s> therefore it is necessary to be precise in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord the minister knows that i have the greatest respect for him and therefore if i say that the reply is rather woolly he will not take that as a personal affront at all because it is not meant to be <e> <s> but we are dealing with a very important matter and i am afraid that the noble lord the minister has not addressed his mind to what may be very imperfect observations that i have made but the noble lord has just not directed his mind to them <e>", "<cs> if members will turn to the first three pages of the police and criminal evidence bill they will see part i powers to stop and search part ii powers of entry search and seizure and part iii arrest <e> <s> so what i was trying to do was to follow the nomenclature of the bill itself <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not think that i have acted incorrectly or misleadingly in so doing <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that by the time the bill passes it will in fact be sections and and it is only when the bill is before parliament that it becomes parts i ii and iii <e> <s> so i am trying <e>", "<cs> is that wrong <e> <s> my lords not for the first time i have dealt incorrectly with parliamentary procedure and possibly it is a question of not having had the benefit as other noble lords have had of sitting in another place <e> <s> i have learnt my procedure in this house at very courteous hands and i apologise to the committee if i have said something wrong on procedure <e> <s> i was prompted to say that and obviously it is not accurate <e> <s> all it really means is that it would have been better had this amendment said parts i ii and iii instead of sections and <e>", "<cs> in endeavouring to persuade the committee that the noble lord the minister is confusing the committee in the course of those <e>", "<cs> it does appear that there is a certain amount of meeting of the ways here <e> <s> the last thing in the world that i want to do in endeavouring to meet halfway down the road and secure a betterment of the bill is to argue further at this stage <e> <s> i think it may be a good idea if the noble lord the minister with his customary diligence and courtesy would look at what i have been trying to say <e> <s> i will look at what he has been trying to say and i hope that between now and report stage it will be possible to bring before your lordships something which is truly acceptable <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if we are invited to give our view on the pattern of crime it will mean referring will it not i ask the noble lord the minister to help me on this point to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> if it is convenient to the committee that amendments nos <e> <s> and should be dealt with now i shall do so with pleasure and i hope with brevity <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for that courteous intervention <e> <s> may i make one observation before i say something specific in answer to the question that the noble lord the minister asked me <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but that makes it even worse <e> <s> if it is to be a serious arrestable offence for it to be a pattern of crime in an area it really means that it is an area where not just trivial offences are being committed but the sort of area where serious arrestable offences are committed <e> <s> that is the designation and the label of the area <e> <s> that is the offensive part <e> <s> my noble friends and i are not trying in this amendment to limit the powers of the police <e> <s> what we are trying to do in a bill which is supposed to deal with police powers and criminal evidence is to stop offensive words occurring in a bill which will be interpreted by the police regardless of codes of conduct as well we have the right to set up road checks in this area for a serious arrestable offence <e> <s> everyone knows even lord scarman found there were difficulties in the area of brixton that this must <e>", "<cs> may i make the position clear on amendments nos <e> <s> and because i think it will help the noble minister and the committee <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has given a very clear indication that he recognises without necessarily conceding them the arguments that have been put forward as to the use of words to which this amendment objects <e> <s> in those <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i can be of some assistance and if i am not then at least i shall have wasted only one minute <e> <s> a considerable time has been spent on what i am sure is an important amendment <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister consider the words <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might be allowed to make just a very short contribution <e> <s> it is not just a question of supplying information for the use of the motorist concerned <e> <s> as i understand the position there are separate authorities who are interested in congestion of traffic <e> <s> there are separate authorities or organisations representing motorists which have a view as to whether road blocks and road checks are really being systematically and sensibly arranged and ordered by the police <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the progressive intervention of my noble friend but it could very well be that it is most interesting for the police and they usually compile them to have statistics as to the number of people in a demonstration <e> <s> i always notice that the numbers seem to differ between those given by the organisers of a demonstration who talk in many thousands and those given by the police who talk in as many hundreds <e> <s> nevertheless we are always interested to know that <e> <s> i am sure that one day somebody will argue i hope not effectively that because of the interference with transport demonstrations should be limited should go off main roads and so on but without these statistics one cannot do anything <e>", "<cs> when the noble baroness was courteous enough to answer my speech i heard from <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall not appear discourteous if i add the words so i should hope <e> <s> i do ask leave to withdraw in view of the fact that the noble baroness the minister has said that this drafting is going to be looked at again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has been most courteous in his reference to my utterances <e> <s> he might as well inform the committee that on that occasion he differed from me <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might be allowed to make a short contribution <e> <s> i hope in a practical way <e> <s> there is anxiety <e> <s> it is shared by eminent lawyers and not least <e> <s> i believe by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord denning <e> <s> the anxiety is that going through the whole of this paraphernalia by way of an oral application before a magistrate will not mean a strict observance of the act if it becomes an act in the way that i believe members of your lordships house would want and the noble lord the minister would want <e>", "<cs> i merely reply quickly to the very helpful comments made by the noble lord <e> <s> obviously as he said we are dealing now with a draft code of practice <e> <s> secondly we are dealing with a code of practice that talks in only general terms about the grounds upon which the application is made <e> <s> i hoped that the noble lord the minister would reply to the effect that what i had said seemed to be a practical suggestion <e> <s> at least some members of the committee i am not speaking beyond that might be happier if the noble lord the minister would say that <e> <s> these provisions are very complex <e> <s> because all of us want these conditions satisfied then either the code of practice or as i would prefer the bill itself should say that all these grounds and not just the ones that are selected in the code of practice should be either in a written information or i would have hoped in an affidavit which supports the application <e>", "<cs> it says supported by <e>", "<cs> of course i want it to be in support <e> <s> however one can have an affidavit or information in support which merely says in general terms this is going to assist in the course of the investigation and that supports the information <e> <s> even if the draft code of practice is carried out in full it does not cover the whole of the provisions of this clause and all the things about which the court is supposed to be satisfied <e> <s> as i said i would have hoped that i was making a practical suggestion but presumably it is not one that commends itself to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i want to do something much kinder than that <e> <s> on further reflection i think that it is part of the group and therefore i shall save the noble lord the minister the need to look further at his papers <e> <s> it must be part of the group and in those circumstances i hope that i can say not moved <e>", "<cs> i hope that what your noble friend is going to say will be useful <e> <s> is it not the case that the question of privilege is covered by the contractual relationship of the solicitor to his client <e> <s> therefore if a clerk acts on behalf of a solicitor is he not acting as the deputed person of the solicitor in regard to that contract <e> <s> i believe that what was worrying the noble lord lord donaldson was the question of legal centres and places of that kind <e> <s> is it not the case that the same contractual relationship would exist with the solicitor at the law centre or at the childrens legal centre as the case may be <e> <s> if that solicitor deputed a clerk or an assistant of his to advise would that relationship not be in exactly the same area as the normal one of solicitor and client <e>", "<cs> in order to shorten the debate i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> this is the very point that was raised in another place <e> <s> with great respect it has no relevance because there is not the slightest doubt that unlawful drugs are among items which can be seized under the present law <e> <s> here we are dealing not with drugs and things of that kind but purely and simply with the records of social workers and doctors <e> <s> as i said it was an error made in another place and i had hoped it would not be repeated here <e>", "<cs> i was not <e> <s> i was just so happy that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby had found another way of amusing himself this afternoon that is all <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting that if they are in the records of social workers or in the records of doctors they should not be seized <e> <s> they will not even be capable of forming part of a search under the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i have put the arguments as well as i can <e> <s> this is regarded by us as a serious point <e> <s> if the minister is not able to concede that it is a serious point and that social workers and doctors are so worried about this lacuna i would obviously wish to seek the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask one quick question if he will allow me to put it to him <e> <s> does he really believe that however complicated a fraud case may be the police would not prepare within a period of days a schedule of the documents and books they had seized <e> <s> we are talking only about scheduling them we are not talking about examining them <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be allowed again very briefly to help the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter if he thinks i am being of assistance <e> <s> all that is required is to count the number of receipts for example and to say bundle containing or receipts <e> <s> then you say bundle of correspondence passing between and then you say what the dates are between such-and-such a date and another date <e> <s> it is done in every solicitors office almost every single day in the very largest of actions by way of a list of documents in discovery <e> <s> to leave the position where the police have got to decide whether or not it is reasonable to take three months six months nine months or a year and to leave people without knowledge of what documents have been seized from their premises is a gross travesty of justice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can briefly assist the committee in this way <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will i think understand that there is concern about this matter and the treatment of tourists and less well-off people <e> <s> in the circumstances will he consider between now and report not just the amendments but the possibility i do not say that this will commend itself to everyone of an insertion in the code of practice that the power of arrest in regard to these matters will be exercised only with due discretion and would not cover trivial offences of the nature that my noble friend has very properly brought before the committee <e> <s> if the minister will give that assurance i have an idea that my noble friend lord gifford in view of what he has said will take a certain course <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that it is just a drafting amendment <e> <s> it really is an amendment that carries this matter much further in the sense that it is not covering a situation where the name and address are not available <e> <s> the qualification about not being readily available means that the police officer presumably need not take very much trouble to try to find out what the name and address is or to check it <e> <s> the noble lord the minister knows the views expressed on this side of the house about the general tenor of this part of the bill but i think the bill was much more acceptable in its original state without the insertion of the word readily <e> <s> i think that can cause a lot of trouble with a police officer saying well it was not readily available and i interpreted readily as being the very second that i asked for it <e> <s> i do not want to carry the argument to a facetious end and reduce it to an absurdity but at this moment i am wondering what would happen if the poor man stuttered <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for intervening <e> <s> it is only because we are so anxious to get on <e> <s> i suppose none of us wants to argue about semantics but the noble lord the minister so appositely mentioned the word reasonable in his answer <e> <s> if he had said that it was not reasonably instead of readily i would have thought that it might be more acceptable <e> <s> if he would say that having heard the brief discussion that has taken place before an attenuated committee there could possibly be consideration of the use of the word readily and other alternatives or leaving the bill where it stood <e>", "<cs> i feel that this deserves some further consideration <e> <s> certainly i shall read very carefully what the noble lord the minister has said but we have always to weigh the balance between the extreme examples that he can give and the fact that injustices of a grave nature can be committed <e> <s> we cannot do it at this moment i appreciate that <e> <s> we cannot do it until we have considered what each of us has said <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment but i hope that the minister will look as carefully as i will at the things which have been said in the discussion <e>", "<cs> i was about to say that the noble lord the minister and i share many interests and one of them was in the video recordings bill <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that this would be an offence under that bill when it becomes an enactment and therefore there will be no difficulty in regard to it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord puts a very proper question but it should be addressed to the government and not to her majestys opposition <e> <s> the reason i say that is because the bill provides that somebody can give an address for acceptance of service <e> <s> i am merely saying that if that is a right given under the bill the person concerned should at least be informed of it <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord renton will take it from me as in no way belittling the point he has made but this matter should have been taken when we were dealing with the question of the ability to give such an address for service <e> <s> that point has now passed <e> <s> i am merely dealing with the fact that the bill has now spoken in relation to that right and the person concerned should know of it <e> <s> if i may be presumptuous enough to say so no doubt the noble lord will now raise this at report stage when we may get clarification <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord renton will allow me to do so i support everything that he says <e>", "<cs> i think it would be convenient to the committee this being a separate principle for us to deal with this separate principle of the court order and then we can go on to the other amendments and deal with rather different principles <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not confusing the noble lord but i must at once admit that if we did not want to take all these together we should have said so before <e> <s> i do apologise but it has occurred to us that it would he only proper to deal with them separately because there are amendments here which deal with the question of time and there are amendments which deal with the question of the principle in regard to an order of the court having to be obtained <e> <s> it is solely that principle that i dealt with in very quickly moving amendments nos <e> <s> a and d <e> <s> that is purely the one dealing with an order of the court <e>", "<cs> we not only bear with him we sympathise with him and we apologise to him <e> <s> at the moment i am covered in sackcloth and ashes if i may mix the metaphor which the noble lord the minister used <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can help the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friends and i repeat our expression of regret <e> <s> we think that what we ought to do is to allow all the amendments to be spoken to together <e> <s> then the speech which the noble lord i am sure was going to abridge in any event will nevertheless cover all the points that are going to be made <e> <s> i think that is the best way for dealing with it and i am sorry if we have held up the committee <e>", "<cs> i only wanted to add just a very few remarks indeed <e> <s> i am not quite following the noble lord the minister unless we are saying in this bill that the police are right and we are right and we know about every conceivable case of young people who come before the courts and who have committed offences and that the juvenile magistrates who are dealing with the offence are secondary to our consideration and the police consideration and our legislative powers <e> <s> all that my amendment and that which my noble friend has moved asked for is this that there should be no power of arrest in regard to the taking of fingerprints unless the court that convicted the young person which would know all about the offence and all about the background of that person made the order <e> <s> it may very well be that the order will be made in per cent <e> <s> of cases so be it <e> <s> i am thinking of the per cent <e> <s> and that per cent <e> <s> might indeed stop because the court would want to do it that young person from thinking that he or she was now in the gallery of convicts i am not trying to be dramatic having had his or her fingerprints taken and been arrested <e> <s> all i am asking for is the sanction of the court that knew all about the case from start to finish <e> <s> that must be right <e>", "<cs> i will detain the committee no longer but we are really saying that we know better than the courts we set up which try these young people <e> <s> i think that is a very sorry state of affairs <e>", "<cs> can i help by saying that so far as i am concerned i shall be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i shall be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> c and i will also be speaking to e <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee and i very much trust for the convenience of the noble lord the minister if at this stage i speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a c and e <e> <s> i have already said that the rest of the amendments in this group which have my name and those of my noble friends attached to them will not be separately moved <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister why he concentrates repeatedly on the draft code of practice in regard to matters that are essential to the liberty of the subject instead of having them in an act of parliament <e> <s> why is the draft code of practice the holy place in which this should be writ instead of what should be the bible itself which is the act of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable and learned friend in another place <e> <s> ones first thought in regard to this grotesque and horrendous incident is to congratulate the anti-terrorist squad of our police led i believe by commander bill hucklesby <e> <s> the promptitude of their actions their skill and their observance of their duty have obviously led to this incident not becoming even more grotesque and horrendous <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down finally may i ask him whether he will undertake since the house is very concerned about the matter to make a further statement as soon as there are any developments which ought to be brought to the attention of the house <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would have some sympathy with me if i said that the list of groupings has only just arrived on our bench <e> <s> if therefore we err at any time i hope the noble lord will be kind enough to put us right and to do it with his usual jovial manner and not in anger <e>", "<cs> it is obvious that i am not abbreviating the proceedings as i hoped to do and therefore i will not elongate them by protesting at the way in which the mind of the noble lord the minister is working in this respect <e> <s> but can he at least tell the committee from when the clock begins to tick if there is a taking of the accused to a police station which is not a designated police station from which he must be removed to a designated police station within six hours then are six hours added to the time <e> <s> does the clock begin to tick from the time of the arrest or from the time of the arrival at the police station <e>", "<cs> i have one quick comment only to make which i am sure the noble lord the minister has appreciated <e> <s> the whole question of the custody officer depends if it is to be effective upon his independence and if i may put this with all respect his intelligence <e> <s> one cannot provide for that in an act of parliament <e> <s> however one hopes that the home office will make it abundantly clear that it expects custody officers not only to be of the rank of sergeant but to be independent in the decisions and recommendations they make as custody officers and furthermore that it is incumbent upon the police force to see that a person of some considerable intelligence is given this very responsible position <e> <s> i repeat one cannot provide for this in an act of parliament but the committee may well be assured in allowing this amendment to go forward to a rather greater degree if the noble lord the minister would indicate that it is the intention of the home office to make this abundantly clear to the police forces <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i agree with every word that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said <e> <s> i rise only to try to delete one subsection but for a very different reason <e> <s> i do so in the lamentable absence of the noble lord <e> <s> lord renton who might i have no authority to say that he would have raised the same point <e> <s> we are always anxious to economise in language in our statutes and to be as concise as possible <e> <s> i ask the committee to look at subsections and with which we are dealing <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me see any reason why instead of two subsections there should not be one which would read <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing to render a delicate atmosphere any more delicate may i ask whether the noble baroness can inform the house if any explanation at all so far has been given by the nigerian government as to why the crates were addressed to the ministry of external affairs <e>", "<cs> it might help if i deal immediately with amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i have already addressed the committee on this matter <e> <s> the short and i hope succinct point is that under subsection there is a period allowed not specified in regard to the length of time for an investigation to be carried out before someone is taken to a police station <e> <s> all that i am saying is that when that happens from the point of view of time of detention which is to be sanctioned by the police and then by the court the clock should start ticking as from the time of arrest rather than from the time of the arrival at the police station <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness in the very short time between when i made that point and she indicated something to the contrary will have become converted <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble baroness to excuse me but we are all conscious of the time and the number of amendments with which we have to deal <e> <s> if she will forgive me for saying so i am specifically dealing with subsection where the police before taking someone to a police station want to carry out investigations <e> <s> that is the sole point at which i direct this amendment and it will waste a great deal of time if we deal with examples which are just not germane to the amendment which i am moving <e>", "<cs> that is not subsection <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt for the last time <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady trumpington will not think me discourteous because she knows that we all have the highest regard for her and that we never wish to be rude <e> <s> i am dealing with subsection which has nothing to do with a violent prisoner and absolutely nothing to do with someone who withstands arrest detention or anything else <e> <s> it is a question of where the police want to carry out investigations and under subsection they are permitted to do so before taking someone to a police station <e> <s> that is the only case with which i am dealing <e> <s> if the noble baroness has been wrongly briefed on this matter <e> <s> i hope that she will reprimand those concerned <e>", "<cs> indeed it is <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness will regard me a little more kindly if later she looks at her brief and finds that it is a brief on amendment no <e> <s> a and not amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> having said that i think it is time that the opinion of the committee was taken <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that assurance <e> <s> may i make absolutely sure under the magnifying glass that the lacuna no longer exists and reflect upon the matter between now and the next stage <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> quite honestly i wonder whether that is the logical way to proceed <e> <s> i entirely agree with what has been said by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington but would not the minister have to hear the case for the various amendments before he deals with them <e>", "<cs> if the committee approves of our dealing with all these amendments together with everybody being so keen to get a move on and not <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord lord denning stands up and makes a speech on a matter of this kind there is no member of your lordships committee who would not wish to listen to every word he says and in the course of listening rather wonder at the ability of anybody to have such a memory that without even looking down at a note he can give the exact dates of a case and say that it was on a saturday on a monday and on a tuesday <e> <s> i am lost in admiration for the way that was done <e>", "<cs> i am not going to say what your lordships think i am going to say <e> <s> having said that one equally listens with rapt attention when the noble and learned lord says that this is a very narrow point which one must look at extremely carefully <e> <s> after a great deal of reflection he finds that he just jumps down or falls down on one side <e> <s> i see that the noble and learned lord is good enough to indicate his assent to that analysis of his state of mind which was so frankly expressed to us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is kind to intervene if he thinks he is helping me or helping the committee but i do not honestly feel that he is <e> <s> i say that first of all because we keep hearing about a code of practice <e> <s> it is easily altered and will come before your lordships house from time to time by the procedure that we know of if ever it is altered <e> <s> secondly the noble lord referred to a caution <e> <s> what does the caution say <e> <s> it says that you need not say anything but anything you do say may be taken down and given in evidence <e> <s> that is all very well <e> <s> those are words which are expressed from time to time <e> <s> they are not very clear in their meaning <e> <s> they certainly are not as simple as somebody being told in ordinary language you need not say anything if you dont want to <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord the minister in his courtesy will give way if we are to have a logical debate and i am sure that he will try to change his tune to one of <e>", "<cs> i am taking the hint and i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter put a very pertinent question and the noble and learned lord lord denning in giving a brief answer may decide that he wishes to elaborate <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would accept it from me that the word obtain as against the words seek to obtain obviously predetermines a result <e> <s> if he thinks that i am incorrect in my use of language let me tell him that i am in good company since this after a lot of consideration is a recommendation of the law society by way of amendment <e> <s> i think that having told the noble lord that he would wish to take it with some seriousness and give consideration to it <e> <s> if the noble lord will do that then i am perfectly happy to withdraw <e>", "<cs> and i am happy in those circumstances to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may follow immediately on the peroration of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i shall do so with much greater power if he is kind enough to listen to what i have to say <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord the minister becomes passionate i know that i must be right because only the fact that he is in some difficulty would lead such a calm personality into such passionate utterances <e>", "<cs> i am talking about the metropolitan area which we all know is the one quite obviously where there is unfortunately a concentration of crime <e> <s> i am talking about the concentration <e> <s> it would not be much for the courts of the metropolis to deal with i know the noble lord the minister was trying to defend areas where there is a pattern of crime and i was trying to tell him that i thought that that was not a very judicious or a very diplomatic course <e> <s> but obviously we are talking in terms throughout the kingdom of something that would be a very small burden indeed upon the magistrates courts <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is going now from passion to rhetoric from rhetoric to drama and from drama to a misrepresentation of what i said although i know innocent i repeat although i know innocent <e> <s> the noble lord the minister can waggle his head <e> <s> i said although i know innocent and i have made it perfectly clear that i have nothing but admiration as have all my noble friends for the police force and their various officers <e> <s> i have nothing against the superintendents <e> <s> i did not suggest that they would break the law <e> <s> i said that from a practical point of view we all know that it is scarcely likely that being asked to extend for twelve hours they would refuse <e> <s> that is a perfectly human polite remark to make and it must not be distorted <e>", "<cs> that is very helpful <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord knows although i should like to make it clear that these are amendments recommended by the law society <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord feels that they are worthy of his consideration and that they may be accepted <e>", "<cs> i think that the latter course suggested by the minister is the sensible one <e>", "<cs> i promise the committee to be very short in regard to this and i especially did not speak on clause stand part because i thought it much more sensible and i know the noble lord the minister will allow me to deal with the essential points of clauses <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all the members of the committee will be relieved to hear that the fire is being reserved until the next occasion and will not go off at the present moment <e> <s> having said that may i add a sentence <e> <s> i know that the government always feel that in their pursuit of these matters and especially of what they call law and order although there is no difference between us on the necessity to keep law and order they are following public opinion <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson referred to a recent article in <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> the only point is i get so nervous when the noble lord the minister does something exceptional <e> <s> the moment the message came over that he was going to accept it it put me into a great nervous tension <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness would agree that if the application would automatically be granted there would be no harm in conceding the amendment <e> <s> however in view of the fact that she appears to have taken a line at the moment that the amendment is not necessary i wonder whether i can ask her to review again what i have said based on information and briefing given to me by the law society <e> <s> i hope that she will at least look at the matter again so that we may avoid possibly having to deal with it next time <e>", "<cs> i asked the noble baroness whether she was prepared to consider what had been said which she may not have realised beforehand in view of the fact that i was representing the views of the law society <e> <s> if she will kindly intimate that consideration will be given to my remarks i shall take a certain course <e>", "<cs> it is kindly accepted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say most modestly that we are equally sure that ours is the right one <e> <s> there is no point in repeating all the arguments <e> <s> they have been advanced before they are on the record and i think at this stage therefore the sensible thing for me to do is to ask for leave to withdraw <e> <s> the noble lord the minister knows our views perfectly well <e>", "<cs> may i make life easier for all of us and repeat that this is a point that has been raised earlier in the debate <e> <s> the government have made their position clear <e> <s> we have made our position clear <e> <s> i think the sensible thing is to beg leave to withdraw having recorded my remarks <e>", "<cs> that was the answer <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble and learned lord would agree that in those circumstances there would not be delay <e> <s> but i have an idea i think that this is illustrative of the whole of our proceedings at the present moment that minds even as brilliant as that of the noble and learned lord are not as clear at this time of the morning as at other times <e> <s> that applies possibly to all of us and is somewhat a criticism of our debating matters of this kind and trying to legislate at this hour of the morning <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord at other times of the day does not do that <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that possibly i should say one sentence <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will appreciate that we on these benches are very anxious about this provision <e> <s> we wonder whether the target is quite what <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that neither the noble and learned lord nor any lord present will think me discourteous for not having been in my place when the noble and learned lord commenced his explanation of this amendment <e> <s> it was brought forward rather suddenly <e> <s> i had been told that the proper time for taking it was half-past seven <e> <s> having heard even half of the explanation by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am perfectly content with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble and learned lord has noticed that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is not in his seat <e>", "<cs> my lords the extraordinary thing is not that the case was <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be forgiven for exercising an old hobbyhorse in the course of this bill i ventured very humbly and there were those who agreed with me to wish that magistrates courts disappeared from family jurisdiction and that there were in fact only family courts united in their wisdom and dealing purely and simply with family matters <e> <s> but if magistrates courts are to remain and they have jurisdiction in matrimonial cases it is only right that they should have the power so lucidly explained by the noble and learned lord in this commons amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will remember that there was some anxiety when the county courts act was consolidated that the consolidation took place just at the time when we were discussing the provisions of this bill which gave some extended jurisdiction to the county courts in matrimonial matters and in view of this we wondered whether the time was apt for the consolidation <e> <s> it appears that these amendments will now carry through into the act the changes made in that jurisdiction and we will therefore have a fairly tidy situation for the practitioners which some of us thought did not exist before <e>", "<cs> my lords there are not many uninitiated members of your lordships house in regard to any matters but just in case somebody happens to have crept in who is uninitiated in these matters it is perhaps pertinent to say that section to which the noble and learned lord referred is a very <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is appropriate to utter only a few sentences <e> <s> this is a valuable bill <e> <s> when it came to this house many of us had very definite views about the way in which certain clauses should be drafted and about the policy behind them <e> <s> we were treated as always with the utmost courtesy by the noble and learned lord when he differed from us and with a kindly smile when we agreed with him <e> <s> this bill is now a better bill as a result of what happened in this house and now as a result of what happened in another place <e> <s> i hope that when it very shortly becomes an act upon our statute book it will bring some amount of relief in that type of case which has the sympathy of so many of us and where if the law is not a kindly law so much distress and pain can be caused <e> <s> i hope that this bill will avoid much of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for having anticipated part of my question which therefore need not be repeated <e> <s> but is the noble lord the minister aware of the anxiety that has been expressed in this house about the fact that some of these cults can register as charities under the existing law and are therefore being subsidised out of taxpayers money <e> <s> is the minister considering this question in consultation with his right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> is it the governments intention to bring forward amending legislation so far as the charities act is concerned to cover matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall be forgiven if i return for one moment to the worrying aspect of charitable status <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will recollect that he was kind enough to indicate that his right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general was looking into certain cases <e> <s> would he consider consulting as i suggested before his right honourable friend the home secretary as well as the attorney-general with a view to securing some clarification or alteration of the law which entitles these people to charitable status under the heading of the advancement of religion <e> <s> ought we not to have a look at the law in order to see whether it is not just a question of the admissibility of certain charities but whether the whole category should be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords does one have to be and i say this with deep respect a statistician or a superintendent of police let alone a chief constable to know in human terms that if society does not want you and you have no useful task to perform in it you are turned into an enemy of society <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister saying in the light of these ordinary human facts that do not need research that the government have nothing to offer in regard to a lost generation that all of us every one of us is responsible for in <e>", "<cs> it is with fear and trembling that i follow the noble and learned lord not for the first time in regard to this bill <e> <s> on many occasions i have had the opportunity as have my noble friends of saying how much we agree with him but there comes a time when if we think that he errs in spite of his great wisdom it is our duty to say so <e>", "<cs> it appears that the matter of principle is agreed to by the two noble and very distinguished learned lords who have spoken <e> <s> i add the word distinguished because i find that they agree with my amendment <e> <s> i did not use that adjective on the last occasion <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning knows that i regard him as does everybody else as being entitled on all occasions to that description <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord will forgive me if i adopt the phrase of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and say that i think there is some confusion of thought here <e> <s> we are not of course dealing in any way with the case of the prosecution <e> <s> we are dealing here with the summary of what is said in mitigation after conviction and in that regard according to our procedures it is not our practice for prosecuting counsel to plead for a certain sentence or to answer any plea in mitigation that may have been made unless there is an error of fact which he corrects in order to enable the judge to know precisely what are the true facts <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for answering my question because he has answered it in the way in which i anticipated <e> <s> there can be a very distinct relevance as regards the <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord was known at the bar and always will be as the advocate who would never give up and who always had an argument to address to the court which was worth listening to <e> <s> his last argument was worth listening to but i am sure he will forgive me if i say that it in no way affects the principle of what i was saying <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord would agree with any practising lawyer who has any experience of these matters that the example which i gave is a common one and not an unusual one <e>", "<cs> i think that in the circumstances it would be a proper course for me to take in regard to amendment no <e> <s> a to say that i too on behalf of my noble friends think that the suggestion of the noble and learned lord ought to be taken advantage of

all that has been said i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> again in the light of what has been said it is not appropriate i believe to have a debate at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will as usual be indebted to the noble and learned lord lord scarman not only for the amendment that he has moved but for the magnificently clear and eloquent way in which he has presented it <e> <s> having said that i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will allow me to review some of the points which he made and i should like to express some anxiety in regard to

summarise the objections in the following way <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could agree with the noble and learned lord who has put his arguments against this succinctly and with charm as he always does <e> <s> but it goes far deeper than that <e> <s> i turn immediately to what was stated by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> the clause itself provides perfectly clearly that the crown court rules may make provision for requiring any party to proceedings before the court to disclose to the other party or parties any expert evidence which he proposes to adduce <e> <s> the wording of the clause is not such as to give notice of the nature of any expert evidence it is likely to call <e> <s> i would have had much more sympathy with such wording as would the law society <e> <s> under this rule the party has to show its experts report and that obviously is something that is fundamental to the objection that i put <e>", "<cs> for the purpose of the record i wonder whether the noble lord the minister could indicate what bill of any government has had the pleasure of hearing the noble lord the minister in charge of it state on so many occasions that he has every intention of opposing the question whether clauses in the bill as originally drawn by the government shall in fact stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords on a lighter note than that heavy one would the noble earl who is doing so well

"<cs> my lords i have only a very brief comment to make <e> <s> it is not in opposition to this amendment but purely to call the attention of the house to the fact that the extension to years makes

i thought it only right to emphasise that point at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords ones recollection goes back to the sturdy debates that took place in your lordships house on the very matter of ensuring that there was sufficient quota of eec material including obviously material emanating from the united kingdom <e> <s> ones recollections are of endeavours made by the noble lord lord hill of

lordships were interested namely that the government will inform the authority of the importance which they attach to the quota provision and to the promises that are made and that the authority will act with proper sternness in cases which show that unreasonably the licensee has not kept his promises <e> <s> i shall keep talking if i may for a moment or two because i believe that that might help

to keep the noble lord the minister usefully employed for a few moments <e> <s> my understanding is that this is not quite clear <e> <s> i think that all your lordships would wish to have the matter clarified <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do disagree with and may i use the word with and not the word to as appeared on the marshalled list because i think that is a typographical error the commons amendment no <e> <s> and i propose the following amendment in lieu thereof namely the insertion of a new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in his concluding remarks the noble lord the minister said that we had to catch a train in regard to this matter and had better catch it <e> <s> i can only say that he has arrived on the station very late and he has had to jump on the train almost as it <e>", "<cs> my lords as one would have expected of the noble lord the minister the undertaking has been faithfully fulfilled and obviously i am very gratified to see this amendment now before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed an elaboration of speech by saying tonight as distinct from last night that we are very happy too with this amendment which is really technical <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish to do anything else but express gratitude for the distance that the government have gone in regard to this matter which troubled many of us and as the noble lord the minister was kind enough to say which also troubled me on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> we were so anxious that the spirit of this bill should be kept and that because of lack of means or because of the feeling that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am hoping that your lordships will not be confused by the reply of the noble lord the minister to this amendment <e> <s> i hope too that your lordships will have in mind that we are considering merely amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have the authority of the noble lord lord gifford to say that on this occasion certainly he will not be moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that means there is no need for any of us to consider whether there is any limitation to be placed upon a superior officer when authorising a road check in these circumstances <e> <s> that superior officer has to consider merely whether there is likely to be a breach of the peace <e> <s> he has not to consider whether or not there is danger to life or limb or serious risk of damage to property <e>", "<cs> my lords the light in this bill and in your lordships house is certainly less cloudy than it was before the noble lord moved his amendment which i happily accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one point to make possibly because i hope for a different attitude from the noble lord the minister courteous though it always is in relation to the various amendments <e> <s> when this amendment was moved on the last occasion when many of us wondered why it was necessary to have a designated exit and the other exit there was a very lengthy argument from the front bench opposite as to why we were completely wrong and confused in our argument and how perfect the situation would be if the bill remained unamended in this respect <e> <s> all of us favour the transgressor who is converted to another view but may we at least hope that when we put sensible arguments they will receive sensible replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is unnecessary to make a long speech after the noble lord lord renton has spoken <e> <s> without any doubt at all both this clause and as he mentioned clause to which i was going to refer when we came to it are so abstruse that it makes it completely nonsensical if i may use that language to legislate in this form <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton may be right or wrong in his interpretation and i too have followed him into schedule i can only say that if he be wrong there will be many lawyers who will he wrong with him <e> <s> it is absolutely vital that we get this provision right in clear and simple language <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house because the noble lord the minister is being so constructive may i merely point out to him and i hope that my noble friend lord renton will agree with this that the complication is not only in the way in which this has been presented <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that before one has to decide whether or not a clause ceases to have effect one has to find the definition of excluded material which is new to this bill see whether it applies to an old act be it a local or a public act and then do exactly the same in regard to special procedure material <e> <s> that is a complicated exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships may agree that we are confronted by a rather unusual situation and one where we ought to be a little careful <e> <s> it was the considered view of the government as argued at committee stage that the words in the bill merely made it obligatory upon the police officer to have grounds for suspecting and these are the words that we are dealing with and that it was not necessary and indeed was objectionable to have the <e>", "<cs> the minister can do so anyway my lords it is his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down can he say where we stand on the advice given to the government <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder whose views i always respect said as did the noble lord lord renton that these words mean nothing <e> <s> the government have obviously been advised that these words mean something otherwise they would not take the trouble to put an amendment before the house to have these words removed <e> <s> the minister was absolutely frank with the house <e> <s> he said that these words cast a duty upon the officer which he wants to remove the duty of having to give some kind of grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be good enough to clarify subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously an extension a widening of what was previously in the bill <e> <s> one does not necessarily want to oppose it on that account <e> <s> however in view of the fact that this means that the police are being given further powers as it were to refuse information or documents copy documents and so on will the noble lord the minister give to the house an assurance that these matters will be regulated in the code of conduct in order that the police may not unreasonably rely upon these widened powers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed an important matter and all of us will be glad to have had the benefit of the advice of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> possibly it is fitting at this moment that a solicitor stands before your lordships in order to give another point of view <e> <s> in the bill as it stands this is what we are doing <e> <s> i ask your lordships not to think the whole time of a crime similar to that to which the noble and learned lord referred us involving millions of pounds worth of gold or whatever it may be and obviously being a classic crime of the highest order <e> <s> here under the bill as it stands we are considering a serious arrestable offence <e> <s> we had trouble with the definition of serious arrestable offence and the noble lord the minister found that he could not give way in regard to the major criticisms that we then made of it <e> <s> one of the definitions of a serious arrestable offence is an offence which in the view of the police officer concerned causes a serious financial loss to someone <e> <s> as we explained the serious financial loss could be to the widow who has been robbed of her mite it could be the pettiest theft but it would still be a serious arrestable offence <e> <s> it would be something that offended against the conscience of everyone of your lordships but obviously when it came before the court it would not be a case of the category to which the noble and learned lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me as he always does with such courtesy to make the position abundantly clear <e> <s> i speak with the full authority of the law society which i consulted very fully yesterday <e> <s> they cannot be in favour of amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i am authorised to say that and i have said it very clearly and deliberately but that does not mean that they are not in complete sympathy with the spirit of this amendment namely that there should be the right to consult a solicitor as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord the minister is considering a possible correction i will ask him to consider another <e> <s> he just stated that these applications take place in open court <e> <s> i believe he will find that the applications although <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always said that in my judgment the minister is a great loss to my profession <e> <s> indeed he speaks with all the qualification almost of a trained lawyer <e> <s> the minister has explained why he used the words open court and may i say that these applications take place very speedily because they are not in open court <e> <s> therefore the papers come before a couple of magistrates who might be sitting and it is a fairly simple matter for them to deal with the hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am endeavouring with due modesty to take the very courteous speech of the noble baroness on board <e> <s> i am most grateful to her for what she says and i am most grateful for the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house indeed the country at large will be very grateful to the noble baroness for her pertinacity in moving this amendment on this occasion altered as it is from the amendment that she moved at committee stage because of what the noble lord the minister very correctly said on that occasion about the inclusion of soft drugs <e> <s> she can certainly count upon the support of my noble friends if i may speak for them as i am authorised to do on this occasion in her desire to see that every conceivable step is taken to stop the filthiest trade that is ever practised in any country in the world which this is <e> <s> if we succeed in doing that or at least in stemming it we are not only catching people who deserve to be caught and brought under the criminal law but we are most likely saving the lives of many young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will permit me to raise a point of order which can be decided by those much more experienced than i <e> <s> the debate was conducted on a grouping which included all these amendments <e> <s> the debate has been concluded and concluded in a most satisfactory way with every point being dealt with <e> <s> even if the minister did not agree with some of the things said he said so and they are under consideration <e> <s> i do feel that we ought to get a move on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is as precipitate as he always is but on this occasion not absolutely correct <e> <s> we are dealing here with a very important clause about information being given either to a member of the family or to a friend that a person is in a police station <e> <s> on the last occasion the noble lord said that possibly the words without delay were difficult words to include in the bill <e> <s> although originally they were in the bill because it might mean that a civil claim arose against the police if there was one minute of delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will have been very pleased to hear the speech that the noble and learned lord made on a drafting amendment <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall obviously consider what has been said but for the moment i sit down <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so gratified by the promise of what is going to happen to amendment no <e> <s> a that i feel the less i say the better <e> <s> i therefore propose to read with great pleasure as always what has been said by the noble and learned lord and wait with eager anticipation to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of a most generous profession <e> <s> i am happy to agree with the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords with alacrity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> what i was going to say was that the series of amendments from our point of view deals with a most important point <e> <s> it is that parts and of the bill which as your lordships know deal with detention and the questioning and treatment of persons by the police should not be effective until after the tape-recording system is in vogue throughout the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches feel that we must be consistent <e> <s> we said before on an amendment that we regarded as very important amendment no <e> <s> and all that followed that both the hour and the state of the house make it quite wrong to debate important issues <e> <s> i know that it is nobodys fault but we did in fact lose a great deal of time that nobody anticipated losing this afternoon when the various amendments which i am sure the alliance party felt were most important were being discussed <e> <s> and then of course we lost some time on the statement <e> <s> i feel that i must be consistent and say that we do not intend to participate in a debate on this important subject at this hour and with this attenuated house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the noble lord the minister to give way <e> <s> if i had merely said and my noble friends had agreed with me that we should not pursue the matter in view of the lateness of the hour i should not have been content with my submission at all <e> <s> it is not a question of the lateness of the hour we are prepared to stay until goodness knows what time <e> <s> it is a question of the state of the house on an important matter of this kind and on an important bill <e> <s> it is absolutely wrong for an attenuated house like this to be deciding matters of such great import on a bill which is so important <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness could assist us by way of contrast and tell us how many of our people having diplomatic status have claimed immunity abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness when looking into the complexities of the matter of life peerage <e> <s> bear in mind that life peeresses have an unfair advantage over life peers in that it is well-known that they live very much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a most exciting spectacle in regard to any amendment to hear a lord of appeal in ordinary who has the respect of the whole of our profession and of this house state <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the admission improperly obtained that i was endeavouring to get <e> <s> i have got it in evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords to say that i am disappointed as a result of my brevity is an understatement <e> <s> i make but two comments and again i make them very rapidly <e> <s> the first is that your lordships will appreciate that these provisions of the bill come into effect before there is any question of universal tape-recording of interviews <e> <s> your lordships will also realise that i gave the strict alternative very clearly i hope that all that the police would have to do is to repeat the confession which they have said they have obtained in front of a solicitor when he arrived after the delay and if that was repeated and the accused admitted that that was his confession then of course it would be admissible <e> <s> what other safeguards can the noble and learned lord want <e> <s> i feel that your lordships opinion on this vital matter certainly to my profession should be put to the vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will allow me to raise a point of order <e> <s> i do it as he will know most respectfully but he is at this moment the guardian of the order of the house <e> <s> i would refer him to our <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will allow me to quote the words which i wrote down i hope accurately as to the guidance we were all given by the government front bench <e> <s> that guidance was that to proceed with amendment no <e> <s> would be thoroughly clumsy and not necessarily inconsistent <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton said that it was not inconsistent at all and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said that it was not consistent at all <e>", "<cs> not inconsistent <e> <s> the advice we have been given is that apart from the thorough clumsiness it would not necessarily be inconsistent which means that there is a doubt about the inconsistency <e> <s> i should have thought that in those circumstances indeed this would be my hope in order that we have a clear discussion amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it clear that we do not object to these amendments at all <e> <s> the only reason that i have risen is that we have amendments which follow <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of amendment no <e> <s> which relates to line whereas these amendments delete to the end of line <e> <s> our amendments have as their object giving the police complaints authority further powers than they are given under the bill the very thing that the minister thinks is most likely to happen <e> <s> for the sake of clarification what i intend to do is not to move amendment no <e> <s> when is is reached but to agree to this amendment which deletes to line and then to move amendment no <e> <s> if i may <e> <s> i thought that would make it clear to the minister and to your lordships and it is my sole reason for rising <e>", "<cs> the whole purpose of this amendment is to follow a line of thinking which is common to lawyers laymen the police judges and everyone when considering this bill namely that there must be public confidence in the police and in their conduct <e> <s> we who have supported the police and who will continue to do so in the proper exercise of their powers have always felt as i know all your lordships do that there must be proper safeguards in regard to complaints made against the police where they are appropriate <e> <s> they must be properly and independently judged <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest possible respect and within one minute by way of my own target do i answer the noble lord the minister <e> <s> there is nothing that the public will accept and i say this frankly and in no mistaken language i hope other than an investigation of their complaints by an <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of such cases is minimal and if we are going to legislate on the basis of the real exceptions to a general rule we shall never produce any positive legislation at all to deal with the scarman recommendation which was so strong <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord scarman knows as much as anybody does about the nature of complaints against the police <e> <s> he investigated these matters before he reported <e> <s> his recommendation was simple and clear and it is in accordance with the resolution i now put before the house and upon which i ask the houses opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is such a shame that the government are resisting every single opportunity to do what the noble and learned lord lord scarman recommended and which one would have thought was so obvious from the point of view of public relations with the police that is to say not just to set up a procedure of supervision but to provide that laymen or people certainly not in the police force deal with complaints even minor ones <e>", "<cs> what a gift for the holiday the noble lord the minister has given me <e> <s> i should never accuse him of hostility that is a quality that he is quite unable to extract from himself <e> <s> what i do find in that brief is a feeling that this is not a happy phrase <e> <s> if the shadow home secretary in another place pleaded on behalf of the poor victim then that is something that i obviously respect it is something that all of us would do <e> <s> but in my judgment it has nothing to do with some of the points that i was trying to make before <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will appreciate the clarity with which that explanation was given of this amendment and i think will also appreciate the consideration which the minister has throughout given to those of us who objected among other things to that phrase the area where patterns of crime are existent <e> <s> the minister was as usual redoubtable in his arguments in favour of that definition at one stage but i am so glad that he has seen the light <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to deal with the contributions made by the three noble lords who have just spoken one of whom deserves the title of noble and learned lord <e> <s> with the greatest respect it is not accurate to say that the principle of this matter was decided at a previous stage <e> <s> if it had been this amendment would not be before your lordships <e>

the moment on the application of a constable <e> <s> i make no disrespectful reference to the rank but it is a constable who has to go before a justice of the peace <e> <s> there is no reference in the bill to the fact that a justice of the peace is to be accompanied by his clerk <e> <s> one can imagine that an urgent application would be made to a justice of the peace without his clerk being present <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to be equally brief as i trust i was when i moved this amendment important though i think it is <e> <s> we are dealing very much with matters that affect the liberty of the subject and his rights before the law <e> <s> your lordships have to decide being eclectic in these matters one has to be one cannot put the whole of the code into this bill what are the important provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so without trying to dramatise my observations on this amendment this is a typical case where your <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord the minister will forgive me <e> <s> that is a wholly false impression which i am sure that he did not want to create <e> <s> my whole point concerned the effect on the accused <e> <s> it was not a question of doubting the sincerity honesty or integrity of the officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i was not clear <e> <s> i meant to say that i was moving amendments no <e> <s> to and also amendments no <e> <s> and <e> <s> if i did not make that clear i apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords let me make myself abundantly clear <e> <s> i wish to move amendment no <e> <s> nothing in the world will prevent me from doing so except your lordships anger <e> <s> when moving amendment no <e> <s> i intend to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>

purpose of brevity that i would also be speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and although i accept immediately that i will not be moving those amendments <e> <s> however the house will have the great opportunity of hearing somebody far more capable than i move those amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not expect that there would be such complete agreement with that last remark <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is a powerful debater and i would be the first to pay that tribute <e> <s> however the fact remains and this is why we are so concerned with this amendment that although we are dealing with detention without charge even if an accused person or a detained person has no questions directed to him on a journey he is still being detained and his liberty is still being taken from him <e> <s> his liberty and his rights are in your lordships hands and it is for that reason that i ask your lordships to support these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble and learned lord for my over-anxiety to raise a point with him <e> <s> this arises on what the noble and learned lord said about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i can quite

done it without listening to the debate or the arguments that were advanced by both sides and that is not his usual exercise of the great judicial expression which he has shown to date <e>", "<cs> my lords if i showed my discomfort in that rather unpleasant situation i did not mean to do so <e> <s> the noble and learned lord interrupted me in the middle of a sentence <e> <s> i was going to explain

which this country is unfortunately faced we must have at least temporarily the exclusion of certain rights even if unfortunately we hurt the innocent <e> <s> that is the reason why parliament passed a temporary terrorism act as a result of which all kinds of liberties have to be given up if people are charged with acts of terrorism but not yet convicted <e> <s> the noble and learned lord knows

proceedings <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister will forgive me if very briefly i answer his one word no by saying that he might care in his courtesy to give consideration to the point that i raised on clause stand part otherwise of course the matter will have to be dealt with by an amendment at the report stage to cover the position <e>", "<cs> i only asked the noble lord the minister to consider the position in regard to fixed penalties and the prosecuting service and the lapse by the police in administering a fixed notice provision when it was deemed by the prosecuting service that that was the proper thing to do <e> <s> i merely asked the noble lord to consider it and possibly write to me on the matter because it might save tabling an amendment at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble and learned lord knows me well enough to know that i should not have risen in the middle of a sentence unless i thought that my intervention might be helpful <e> <s> i have an idea i may be wrong that the noble and learned lord thought we were dealing with amendment no <e> <s> which deals with cautioning whereas in fact we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e>

enter a <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful as are my noble friends and i am sure those associated with this amendment for the way in which the noble lord the minister has dealt with it and has given certain assurances <e> <s> i know that before i ask for leave in the circumstances to take a certain course the noble lord will forgive me if i quote only for the purpose of the record one sentence in the philips report the royal commission on criminal procedure at page <e>", "<cs> as one who loves his side of the profession as much as the noble and learned lord loves his i think it would be expedient if i remained silent <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee will be obliged to my noble friend lord irving of dartford for having explained this amendment which i do not think was clear to many of us when we saw the original wording <e> <s> now that we know his thoughts having been expediently silent in regard to the last discussion i wonder whether i may however voice my feelings which at

quickly i should have thought that the shoplifting case was the very example that i wanted to take instead of making it an exception <e> <s> one knows that there are many cases of stores bringing

service and the duty of the prosecuting service in certain respects even though the proceedings were not brought by or even known to at their initiation the prosecutors service <e> <s> i do not understand how the prosecutors office can possibly do this without their having knowledge of proceedings <e> <s> one does not imagine that these proceedings will be so multifarious that he would have to examine them in such detail and that they would occupy very much of the time of the prosecutors office <e> <s> if the nature of the prosecution is immediately brought to his attention i should have thought that in very many cases he would see by the very nature of the charges that there is no need for him to interfere and no need for him to consider whether matters of public policy are involved

consideration <e> <s> that having been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for endeavouring to help me and to the noble

very direct and pointed intervention <e>", "<cs> i can answer that very simply <e> <s> the answer is the following <e> <s> the amendment would make it mandatory for the director to report to the attorney and for the attorney on receiving this report to have it laid before parliament <e> <s> the whole burden of my amendment is that that should be mandatory <e> <s> of course if we did not put anything in the bill there would be nothing to stop the director doing this or the attorney-general laying something before parliament but there would be nothing telling him that he should do so <e>

grateful to noble lords for the emphasis which was placed in this little debate on the fact that the amendment talks about general guidelines <e>", "<cs> i issue an open invitation in i hope the clearest possible way and without asking for any copper-bottomed undertaking <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> i invite the minister to say that he accepts the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> if at a later stage in the bill an amendment could be brought forward which would except those very small cases that might arise where public policy was involved i would not test the opinion of the committee at this stage <e> <s> if the minister is not prepared to give that undertaking or that acceptance of the amendment subject to that one proviso then i must ask for the committees view <e>", "<cs> i could not have answered the noble lord lord renton with half the eloquence and clarity that the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson has used <e> <s> i merely with humility adopt his words <e> <s> but i

us have decided and quite rightly so that this is a completely non-political <e>", "<cs> i do regard it as necessary if i may say so to dot the is and cross the ts in regard to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord simon was not as fair as he usually is because i brought it to the attention of the committee with a smile that this question of foreboding as to future ministers while praising the present ones was an old tradition of parliament and indeed was invoked whenever one was asking for something to be done which the present minister said was bound to happen but which was not contained in an act of parliament in a mandatory form <e> <s> but obviously i accept his words coming from the source that they do with due respect <e>", "<cs> i promise not to weary the committee but i was just about to advance what i regarded as being the finest point in my speech when the noble lord lord campbell of alloway asked whether he could intervene <e> <s> i sat down and

by the noble baroness is completely covered i should like to say that as i heard the noble lord the minister but i may be wrong he did refer to the desirability of police premises not being occupied by the prosecuting authority <e> <s> however the noble baroness i thought very pointedly also mentioned <e>", "<cs> i should like to add only a few comments if i may disclosing an interest in the fact that i am a solicitor and therefore have the happy privilege of instructing counsel <e> <s> i associate myself with everything that has been said and i rise only to add this point <e> <s> one of the main troubles which has afflicted our criminal courts has been that both prosecuting and defence counsel on some occasions and i accentuate the word some have elongated trials beyond anything that is reasonable by virtue of their lack of experience and i attribute no other motive to those unnecessary prolongations of proceedings <e> <s> it is therefore vitally necessary and indeed it is an economy in regard to the running of the prosecuting service and the administration of our courts that competent and experienced counsel are encouraged and not discouraged to take on this work <e> <s> i therefore hope for that reason alone but there are others that the noble lord the minister and those who are in charge of these matters will consider most carefully what has been said by the noble lord lord hutchinson and by my noble friend lord elystan-morgan <e>", "<cs> i regret having to disappoint my noble friend in rising to deal with some of the remarks that she has made as i am a member

all of us tremble at it <e> <s> i wonder whether i may respectfully analyse what he has just said <e> <s> i should like first to make my own previous remarks quite clear <e> <s> there is of course a power available to magistrates to order costs in cases which are triable either way or triable on indictment and to make that order out of central funds <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has most correctly said we are not dealing with that type of case <e> <s> what we are dealing with is the summary case <e> <s> i am able to tell your lordships that i am no grandee at all <e> <s> i spent the first years of my professional life if i may confide in the committee being called the attorney-general for lambeth not a very grand place but one that i loved and the place of my birth <e> <s> i recall cases in the magistrates courts that appeared much too difficult for me it happened quite often when i had the assistance of the noble lord lord hutchinson <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry if there is some confusion but i want to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> which is a separate point <e> <s> i therefore beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> may the light burn even brighter as a result of two amendments being subjected to the noble and learned lords further consideration <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> woe betide counsel who receive two briefs upon precisely the same matter <e>

lighter note does not the healthy appearance of your lordships house this afternoon indicate as indeed do your lordships that anyone trying to obtain euthanasia for this house will have an uphill task

any argument about comparability although i should have thought there was a great degree of comparability <e> <s> the fact that members of a department make an investigation means that they report and it is for the committee of the law society to make up its mind <e>", "<cs> i would hope that all lay and junior members would speak in the same terms and with the same authority as the noble lord lord monkswell <e> <s> having said that i again invite the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to say whether he is prepared to consider the matter in the light of the views that have been put forward <e> <s> if he can give that indication i shall take a certain course <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord courteously repeated what he thought to be the heart of his argument <e> <s> if i may attack that heart with some affection i do so in the following way <e> <s> if it were a fact that the investigating committee investigated and then reported somewhere then i can well understand that one says that you are adding a fifth wheel to the four wheels of the carriage and you are making their work unnecessary <e> <s> you are making it in fact nugatory <e> <s> that is not the position <e> <s> they both investigate and adjudicate because the investigation leads to a decision by that committee as to whether or not there is a <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if very briefly i raise a point leaving the noble and learned lord with some confidence do i say this to deal with the points raised by the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor whether it is the governments intention to bring forward at a later stage of the bill an amendment which would deal with the incorporation of solicitors we have just heard about the incorporation of licensed conveyancers upon the basis let me make it absolutely clear that that incorporated body should be controlled by individual solicitors only and that of course there should be unlimited liability <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord permit me to intervene <e> <s> did he correctly use the words that the government felt that it should be done namely that building societies and banks should be allowed to carry out conveyancing services <e> <s> he may be misunderstood if the language is not clear if i may respectfully say so <e>", "<cs> i think that we are dealing with a matter which causes a great deal of difficulty to the public and a great deal of injustice to many would-be consumers <e> <s> i can well understand why the noble lord the minister felt that he had to answer this amendment in the form that he did because of what the cork committee after a lot of investigation found <e> <s> in other words one can see why it is difficult in view of their recommendation to pass an amendment which will put into this bill the requirement for payment into separate accounts and matters of that kind <e> <s> however the committee would not want to leave the subject in quite this way as though there was no remedy that the government can think of and that this committee can think of and that nothing is to be done <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it assists the noble lord lord donaldson to say that i assume he is asking for the protection of the committee by way of absolute privilege in regard to what he has said about the vendor of the house that he is purchasing <e> <s> having said that and only to get the position absolutely clear if you pay as is usual a deposit to a stakeholder the property in that deposit does not pass at all <e> <s> but if as many people do you have paid the deposit to somebody as an agent for the vendor or to the vendor himself then the property in that deposit does pass <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty but i hope that the committee will bear with me <e> <s> the difficulty arises out of the fact that without any doubt it is the will of all sections in the chamber that this bill the general principles of which we agree to shall emerge from your lordships house in the best possible state <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the bill has not in our view been very carefully or well drafted with the result that there are many points with regard to clauses of the bill with which the lawyers are unhappy <e> <s> a very distinguished colleague of mine who belongs to one of our leading firms and who individually has been through this bill as an expert has raised many of those points and indeed he has communicated them not only to me but also to the noble lord the minister and to the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> to ignore them at the committee stage would be quite wrong to expect the noble lord the minister to reply to them as we reach clause stand part on every one of these clauses would in my view be a most discourteous and unjust position to take up <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i am afraid that the minister did not exhibit his usual graciousness in answer to what i thought was a rather courteous invitation which excused him as well from any need to reply at this stage <e> <s> it is not an answer from a minister who understands what i was saying to speak merely in terms of this being an administration order and that the courts will know that under clause they can make an administration order <e> <s> the very point i was making and which was made to me by a very distinguished lawyer and communicated to the minister as well as to me and the noble lord lord benson was that the court will not know as the noble <e>", "<cs> i promise your lordships committee that this time i shall make a shorter observation <e> <s> clause leaves open the point as to whether the court can hear an application made by a creditor without the company being represented <e> <s> clause does not provide that where a creditor presents a petition he shall forthwith give notice to the company although it must clearly be wrong for a petition presented by a creditor to be heard without the company being given an opportunity to be represented at the hearing <e> <s> one would have thought that that should he covered by the company insolvency rules <e> <s> can the minister say whether that will be done <e>", "<cs> all that i ask the noble lord in the first instance is that he should in his courtesy respond to these points either saying that there is no substance to them which he may say though i hope that he will not because i believe that there is substance in all these comments or where he can do so saying that the government are bringing forward their own amendments in which case i shall know where i stand at the report stage <e>", "<cs> may i make one short point <e> <s> since the presentation of a petition for an administration order prevents a creditor from taking steps to enforce payment of his debts one would think that at the very least a notice of such a petition should have to be filed with the registrar of companies <e> <s> it should be made should it not the duty of the person presenting a petition to file on the same day a notice with the registrar <e> <s> can the government consider this <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> the noble lord the minister did not follow my point <e> <s> it was not that all the creditors should be notified <e> <s> i talked about the notice of the petition being given to the registrar of companies so that anybody searching against the company would see it there <e>", "<cs> i have an idea that the noble and learned lord lord denning will have great sympathy with the four points that i am now going to make in regard to whether this clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i always find that when i invite the noble and learned lords support it seems to have some type of advantageous effect <e> <s> i hope that i shall not be disappointed on this occasion if he cares to address the committee on what i believe are four essential points <e>", "<cs> i apologise because this time i have five points all of them important to make in relation to the drafting of this clause <e> <s> these are points that all members of your lordships committee will appreciate not just those versed in the technical aspects of these matters which are very complex <e>", "<cs> my observations on this clause i hope will show the members of the committee how useful these points are and how necessary it is for the government to consider them <e> <s> we have been looking at clause and i wonder how many of us realise that as i believe to be the case under clause the only sales which the court can authorise have to be sales for cash <e> <s> the authority for that proposition is a very recent one <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> i wish to refer to clause and i regret to say that there will be observations on other clauses between clauses and <e>", "<cs> i can be very brief in regard to my comment on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e> <s> this clause does not appear to require any publicity to be given to changes in the identity of the administrator under clause and clause <e> <s> obviously that matter should be looked at <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee because my observations on clause will be somewhat numerous and lengthy but i cannot help it because they are all important points <e> <s> the first question one has to ask is can there be confirmation from the department of trade and industry that the view is taken that section of the interpretation act will permit the court to make more than one extension of time under the opening words of clause <e> <s> i have raised a similar point before on clause stand part <e> <s> the terms of clauses <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to rise for only one more minute because with great respect the minister cannot get away with those last comments <e> <s> he has now caused me to raise one simple point which i did not raise before and which i was going to raise in writing <e> <s> if one is talking about careful draftsmanship and careful thought i invite your lordships to look at clause <e>", "<cs> i am so grateful to the noble earl lord selkirk and so glad that i asked him whether he would go first in his comments because i have been taking up so much of the time of the committee <e> <s> i was about to develop precisely the same point in a slightly different way if your lordships will permit it <e> <s> the word supervise means that you have control but there are no supervisory powers for the committee set out in this bill <e> <s> you cannot supervise without control and obviously it is a wrong use of the word <e>", "<cs> or if the noble lord the minister intends to give the committee some supervisory powers does he agree that they must of course be set out in the bill so that we know what we are dealing with <e>", "<cs> may i comment briefly on clause <e> <s> the first comment is that it should be made clear that schedule paragraph authorises an administrator to bring proceedings against previous directors or management for breach of duty <e> <s> secondly not a major point but an important one for correct draftsmanship will the minister say why clause and use the terms revised and revisions and not the term modifications which is the term defined in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> this is a very important clause and i am afraid that again there are apparent defects in it and certainly there is a case to answer in regard to those defects <e> <s> in practice this will be an important clause because it governs the rights of shareholders and creditors to object to what is being done in the course of administration <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the scope of the clause because it seems on the present wording that a member or a creditor can complain first about the overall scheme represented by the proposals as a whole or some aspect of the proposals secondly about some particular transaction which the administrator has effected or will effect in pursuance of the proposals or thirdly if it seems and i underline the words it seems a transaction which the administrator has effected or will effect before his proposals are presented to creditors is unfairly prejudicial <e> <s> if that is correct then clause should make that clear <e>", "<cs> i believe that i owe a personal explanation to the very courteous members of your lordships committee who have commented on my interventions on clause stand part <e> <s> may i assure them both that i regard the method i have used as being most unsatisfactory <e> <s> i wish that i did not have to use such a method <e> <s> in amplification of my noble friends comments and without attempting to abscribe blame to anybody i would say that the profession which the noble and learned lord lord broxbourne graces had precisely the same opportunity as from the th and th december and immediately preceding the christmas recess to go through this extremely important lengthy and complex bill <e>", "<cs> with some discomfiture i again appear before your lordships committee as i have observations to make on clause <e> <s> the nub of the clause if i may turn to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and address him directly on this matter in subsection <e> <s> that it is considered is defective in two respects <e>", "<cs> i have one short point to raise on clause <e> <s> it appears that paragraph <e>", "<cs> i have three short points on clause <e> <s> the first relates to the words <e>", "<cs> i have four very brief points which i ask the minister to consider if he would <e> <s> first if one looks at paragraph it appears that the power to take proceedings is rendered redundant by paragraph <e> <s> my second point is this <e> <s> should not paragraph be expanded to give a clear power to transfer all or part of the companys undertaking and property in exchange for securities <e> <s> the noble lord may remember that this is the point that i raised before to deal with hiving-down and other types of reorganisation <e> <s> thirdly should not the power read to borrow and raise money and should not the paragraph make it clear how far an administrator and an administrative receiver has power to create security ranking prior to existing charges <e> <s> lastly will the minister consider whether the paragraphs are really set out in a logical order <e> <s> for example paragraph which reads <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can either now or hereafter tell us what is the need or purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> i have an idea that the noble earl lord selkirk will similarly have some sympathy with the words i shall now express <e> <s> it is not thought appropriate that an administrative receiver should be subjected to the supervision of a supervisory committee <e> <s> as we have said before the word supervise connotes some degree of control <e> <s> a person is not usually called a supervisor if he is powerless to give directions to those whom he oversees as to the manner in which they perform their tasks <e> <s> this is surely the position in this case <e> <s> the administrative receivers primary duties are of course owed to the person who appoints him and he is bound first to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assist on this small point which nevertheless is a question of principle <e> <s> it must be right that nobody wants to know the residence but does want to know the normal address of the creditor <e> <s> perhaps i can assist the noble and learned lord the minister to accept this amendment by asking him a simple question <e> <s> where the inland revenue is a creditor can he please tell me what its occupation is <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to clause <e>", "<cs> the only observation i wish to make is that some of the comments i made on clause stand part apply also to this clause <e>", "<cs> i ask the committee to refer to clause where there are used the bald words <e>", "<cs> one also questions whether this clause should apply only to an insolvent liquidation <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord will look at that matter too <e>", "<cs> i am always amused and indeed instructed when the noble lord lord broxbourne poses a question to the committee especially when he does it with a smile <e> <s> i never thought that the bishops would have had a contribution to make to the insolvency bill but i imagine that if we were honoured by the presence of a bishop tonight he might have said that while he had not acquired the knowledge that the deity existed nevertheless he had reached that belief <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a short observation and i should like to make it also as regards clause in order to save having to rise again when we reach that clause <e> <s> i ask the government this question <e> <s> would it not be helpful if clause and clause were to make some reference to the amount of secured debt and the dates on which the relevant securities were given <e> <s> the noble lord the minister may care to have a look at clause in that context and compare the obligations under both clauses <e> <s> it obviously would be most useful if that information could be given <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to say this at this hour but we have reached a very important clause which vitally alters the law apart from having a misleading heading to which i shall refer in a moment which reads power to disclaim onerous property <e> <s> three major changes in the law are made by this clause <e> <s> the first is that leave of the court will no longer be required <e> <s> the position of a liquidator in this respect will therefore be the same as that of a trustee in bankruptcy <e> <s> that is very important <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for his courtesy <e> <s> i hope he has realised that i was not in any way querying the provision here <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry i do apologise <e> <s> under clause there is only a small point but it is <e> <s> i think an important one as to whether an order under this clause vesting property <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lord is taking more time objecting to my speaking than i should have taken in making the point that i wanted to make and i cannot make it upon any other clause <e> <s> obviously i am in the hands of the committee <e> <s> i will take two seconds to make my point which i think is a useful one that the minister might want to have before him <e> <s> but i am in the hands of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the point that i want to make is this <e> <s> if you have an order under this clause vesting property particularly an order under subsection should it be chargeable with stamp duty <e> <s> if one felt that it should not be chargeable with stamp duty then an appropriate amendment could be made to the stamp act in this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to make three short points on clause stand part <e> <s> in relation to clause would it not have been fairer to have provided that interest on all debts for periods after a company goes into liquidation should in the first instance be at the rate specified in section of the judgments act and that only to the extent of any remaining surplus would a debt which carried interest at a higher rate have such higher interest paid <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord do me a great favour and not introduce any clients to my firm <e>", "<cs> as a matter of courtesy i should like to put the record right in the <e>", "<cs> i shall not cross the noble and learned lord by estimating the number of votes that might be obtained either way <e> <s> i much prefer to adopt the dignified course that he made available to me <e> <s> on the understanding which i think can readily be seen from a perusal of the report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with a matter of great seriousness which affects the whole question of the freedom of the press and the freedom of the public to have access to what transpires in our courts <e> <s> it is a matter of pride which members of the legal profession are so often prone to utter with justification that we <e>", "<cs> in regard to the wording of the amendment of course it follows very strictly the wording of the accompanying memorandum <e> <s> but i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has said and i look forward with great anticipation to seeing the way the amendment ought to have been drawn when i see his own amendment at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not all county court judges are like the noble and learned lord lord simon i wish they were <e> <s> but having said that in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said that he feels this matter can be dealt with administratively i think it would be quite wrong for me to pursue this amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am always prepared to accept advice from wherever it comes even if the advice be somewhat unexpected <e> <s> but having said that i am afraid i am going to ask the committee to express an opinion <e> <s> i want to say why before i ask it to do so <e>", "<cs> it almost does <e> <s> i am pressing the noble and learned lord with what i hope is not too much persistence <e> <s> i said in my opening remarks he will appreciate that i said it on purpose that this was not considered to be a private internal matter of the law society it was a matter of public importance <e> <s> i referred to an act of parliament which dealt with the computerisation of these records which was deemed to be a matter of public importance <e> <s> i am asking him merely for one thing and of course i am going to withdraw on what he said <e> <s> i am asking and i repeat it that the usual helpful co-operation between his department and the law society produce something by helpful co-operation <e> <s> i am not asking anybody to draft something i am asking somebody to co-operate in the drafting <e> <s> that usual co-operation would then mean that there could come forward an amendment which could peacefully go through at report stage instead of my again being met with possible technical <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house possibly the nation will be grateful to the noble lord lord renton for bringing before us this afternoon the question of civil defence a matter upon which there has been much debate much discussion and considerable misunderstanding <e> <s> let me say at the outset that any government any responsible opposition who do not take to themselves the need to protect their citizens and to do so reasonably and sensibly are not worthy of the name of either the government of this country or the opposition in this country <e> <s> i say that especially in regard to the first two elements of this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i had appreciated that point as the noble lord would have expected me to i spoke of an era of rate capping <e> <s> i was not speaking in terms of this expenditure being counted for rate-capping purposes <e> <s> i am talking about the whole atmosphere in which this expenditure has to be envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not talking about their size i am talking about whether or not they will be democratically controlled by local authorities as they are at the moment <e> <s> i shall give way immediately if the noble lord the minister will announce to the house and the nation that fire brigades will now be controlled throughout the kingdom and that it is the planning of his government by democratically-elected representatives <e> <s> i give way to enable the minister to make that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister makes his interventions with such courtesy that sometimes the subtlety of them is not appreciated by the house <e> <s> the subtlety of that intervention is that the fire brigades will of course be indirectly controlled by people who are democratically elected but not democratically elected to look after them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that observation will mean that war at last will be abolished from the earth <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister courteously informed the house that he might not be available for the rest of the debate <e> <s> may i i hope with equal courtesy say that i have a long-standing appointment at seven oclock which means that i shall have to leave the house at that time

allowed me to intervene <e> <s> the point that i was trying to make was this <e> <s> if it be a fact as i believe it to be and as others more knowledgeable than i am believe it to be that a nuclear holocaust means quite literally the extermination of nations of peoples then the sooner the truth be known and uttered by responsible statesmen the more chance we have of a sensible world seeing that

boyd-carpenter has been saying <e>", "<cs> the committee will have heard the observations of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> if i may say so i think he may agree with me that what he has said strongly underlines the point that was made at the last sitting of this committee on the bill namely that where you are dealing with disclaimers you must give the person against whom the disclaimer operates provided he does so within a speedy time the right to dispute the right to disclaim <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will be good enough in replying to the amendment so well moved by the noble lord lord meston to say whether or not third parties who act in good faith and therefore have rights in respect of this transaction are going to be protected <e>",

is the public who will see the effect of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down may i ask him in all frankness whether he is himself pleased with the title of

of this amendment <e> <s> therefore i do not intend to make a long speech at report stage <e> <s> what i notice is that the noble baroness lady faithfull has taken the trouble to set this amendment

do not take advantage of this moment to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad i took the course i did because it enables me to say that naturally i shall have to take the advice of the law society which expressed support for this amendment not only on what the noble and learned lord has said but on the two contributions which were made very validly if i may say so by the noble lord lord renton and the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> in the meantime i think i ought really to ask the leave of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must come to the defence of my noble friend <e> <s> it is not a question of autonomy it is a question of a local authority having a public duty to conduct certain prosecutions <e> <s> noble lords know perfectly well the nature of those prosecutions they relate to the protection of public health and matters of that kind <e> <s> the fear that ratepayers may have to pay money especially in these times of constraint indeed costs are being awarded all over the place against local authorities in respect of the prosecutions that they bring is obviously a matter of great concern to local authorities <e> <s> indeed that fear could defeat the very autonomy of which the noble lord has been speaking because local authorities may be deterred from carrying out their duties and from making decisions which they ought to make literally because of the consequential expense of so doing <e> <s> as i understand it that was the purpose of my noble friends amendment and if i may say so with deep respect it is not answered by the point that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway who always makes very valid points made on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of those remarks for which i am most grateful i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once more i am most grateful <e> <s> i only have to tell the house that i am so amused at the way in which the noble and learned lord uses his great power of advocacy <e> <s> he said that if the amendment had not been moved in the friendly way that it was he would have said and then said it <e> <s> therefore the whole advantage of moving an amendment in a friendly way appears to have been lost <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in the shortest speech that i make to your lordships today say from these benches that we support this amendment <e> <s> at the same time i ought to expresss because i promised that i would do so the apology of my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones for his absence from the rest of the proceedings <e> <s> he has an important public function to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords by arrangement with the noble lord lord morris he had his say and i am grateful to him for it <e> <s> i endorse what he says and i speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak twice the noble and learned lord speaks without prejudice <e> <s> i have never heard such a prejudicial remark <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may briefly express the appreciation of these benches for the gracious way in which the noble lord described our activities on the last occasion in regard to this amendment and for the action he has taken <e> <s> in similar courtesy perhaps i may tell him that we find this amendment acceptable but i want to tell him also that between now and third reading we shall be considering the question of whether or not the leave of the court should have to be obtained before fresh proceedings are started after a discontinuance <e> <s> having given notice of that we are certainly not going to oppose the amendment tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords this is without any doubt a pleasant occasion in that it enables many of us to pay some tributes <e> <s> i entirely agree with the tributes that have been paid so generously by the noble lord lord maude <e> <s> however we owe him a debt of gratitude too we owe it also to the noble baroness lady faithfull and to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> the faithfull-maude-renton bills are indeed the parents of the present legislation <e> <s> it is pleasant to continue because in our wisdom we referred both bills with some parts of which some of us were dissatisfied to the select committee <e> <s> we are indebted to that committee for the work that it did and to the noble and learned lord lord brightman for his chairmanship of that committee <e> <s> lastly we turn to the noble viscount whose skill has already been described in apt terms by the noble lord lord maude <e> <s> i cannot improve on that description <e> <s> i too am an admirer of his subtlety and i use that term in the nicest possible sense <e> <s> it is the noble viscount who has piloted this bill through <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> my lords at the second reading of this bill dealing with the private lives of two human beings the house exercised its usual diligence and care in considering matters of this kind <e> <s> many of us felt that there were special considerations that deserved our sympathy in this case <e> <s> i rise on this occasion only to repeat something that i ventured to say on second reading on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> it was that we <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister has said the provisions of this act were carefully debated in your lordships house last year <e> <s> we realised then as we realise now that there are possibly three fundamental principles which we have to consider and we have to see where the balance of advantage lies in regard to those principles <e>", "<cs> my lords before the government chief whip sits down and before the noble lord lord elton respectively sits down may i be permitted to make the position of the official opposition quite clear <e> <s> we recognise the correctness of what the government chief whip has just said <e> <s> we would add to it having had this intimation of a division which i still hope will not be called and i ask my noble friend to listen to my words if he would that as i understand it the government were good enough to honour their pledge by seeing that the debate on this order took place this afternoon <e> <s> it is by sheer coincidence that the other place has not yet reached this on their order paper <e> <s> it would again be contrary to our tradition if we were to vote against the democratically elected house on an order and it is by sheer chance that we do not know what the decision of the elected chamber is <e> <s> for those two reasons the official opposition would not wish to participate in any division <e>", "<cs> my lords while the house will obviously welcome the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in moving the third reading of this bill we also very much regret that the main pilot of it the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is unwell and we obviously wish him better <e> <s> is it a coincidence that the report of the law commission upon which this bill is based is entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords in all parts of your lordships house there has been concern about the status of the prosecuting service and those in charge of it <e> <s> we from these benches have been endeavouring to play our part in securing that status <e> <s> nomenclature is sometimes important as those of your lordships who have been in the army will probably remember <e> <s> in those circumstances obviously we welcome the governments decision to alter the nomeclature and to do it in the way they have done and therefore we support these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to continue my speech but only briefly by saying i am very glad that the noble and learned lord expressed himself as he did <e> <s> i think he put it in the past tense when he said that i had withdrawn this amendment <e> <s> only to adopt the proper procedure of this house i am now about to do so <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could in fairness and in decency adopt any suggestion made so courteously by the noble lord the minister but i cannot <e> <s> if the minister will forgive my saying so he has given reasons for opposing this amendment which are weak when one compares them with the reasons for requiring that the leave of the court has to be obtained <e> <s> i shall explain those latter reasons briefly one by one <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet sat down <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to address your lordships on the motion that the bill do now pass i make two promises first to be brief and secondly not to repeat the very useful observations that have been made by previous speakers <e> <s> the only words that i shall repeat are my own words of gratitude to the noble lord the minister for the outstanding ability which he has shown in the conduct of this bill through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords with his usual consummate charm the noble lord lord henderson of brompton gave me encouragement by saying before i had the privilege of addressing your lordships that your lordships should discount anything that i said <e> <s> i must pay tribute to his fairness because he said exactly the same of the noble lord the minister who is to follow me <e> <s> i admire your lordships for having stayed in the chamber in order to hear either of us speak having received that mandatory instruction to discount anything we had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord as one would expect of him has made a perfectly fair point <e> <s> what does happen with proportional representation whether it be with national governments or local government is that one gets an inconclusive result <e> <s> in many ways that is as bad as having an overwhelming majority <e> <s> that has been the experience with national governments and local government <e> <s> if you put before an electorate and certainly if you put before the chief officers of local authorities the option of having a workable majority or an inconclusive election result when a firm policy cannot be carried out and when there is alteration from one meeting to another depending on the number of councillors who attend you will receive the reply that an inconclusive majority is the worst of all results <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather difficult to answer an intervention of that kind which if i may say so is just the sort of political remark one would except in the very council chamber to which the noble lord lord harris objected <e>", "<cs> my lords the pleasure that i feel accompanied i know by the pleasure of all your lordships at seeing the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor back again on the woolsack obviously restored to his inimitable strength and capability is unfortunately joined on this occasion with the rather qualified welcome which i have to give to this bill <e> <s> i wonder whether your lordships may bear with me if i go through a few technicalities in order to try to bring out the points that are worrying me and others and when i say others i am talking not only about the members of my profession but also those who are concerned with the rights of members of a family other than the legal wife <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is absolutely right <e> <s> i did not feel that i was very valiant at the time but it is kind of him to pay tribute <e>", "<cs> my lords if i did stand valiantly alone and i believe that i did except as i said for the somewhat kind words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to which i have referred in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for saying that <e> <s> the report goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only to make my point clear <e> <s> the urgency of this bill would have been apparent had there been a great number of wives who might have been unprotected <e> <s> that is not the case because of the numbers who are joint owners of property under modern procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the minister recollect a debate which took place on this very subject initiated by her noble friend on th october last year when my noble friend lord stoddart made an interesting and amusing speech and the noble baroness the minister made an interesting and serious speech <e> <s> was it not then raised as a matter of importance that there had been many more post office workers accidents when we had an extension of summer time and did the noble baroness not then inform the house most usefully that there would be more fuel consumed as a result of that extension her information coming from the central electricity generating board <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl the minister sits down will he forgive an intervention from one who is and who has been for many years a member of the national theatre board <e> <s> does the noble earl the minister think it consistent with his usual dignity and fairness to make a reference in public to the terms and conditions of the service of sir peter hall and a criticism of designers thereby implying extravagance when in private every communication received by the national theatre board from the minister and from the arts council has praised their economic way of running their theatre and not one word of criticism along the lines that he suggests has ever been made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl continues may i thank him for his courtesy in what he has just said <e> <s> i merely point out for the record that of course what i informed him was that at the present moment there are only four designers three of them i think being freelance <e> <s> they are employed for only a few weeks at a time <e> <s> there has never been more than and there are three theatres <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate and a very important one initiated on an unstarred question put down by noble friend lord listowel to whom gratitude has already been expressed <e> <s> i in turn in trying to wind up this debate from the opposition benches wish to associate myself with that expression of gratitude <e> <s> if in winding up i were to take a lot of your lordships time i believe that that might lead to the emigration of certain of your lordships as against the immigration that we are looking at this evening <e> <s> i do not propose to do that but i must make the following comment and i do so in all sincerity <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a question of each case in justice being looked at on its merits <e> <s> is this not a case where most unfortunately the parole board was not informed by the police nor was it stated in the papers before the board that this threat had been uttered to this poor woman <e> <s> ought not very careful attention to be paid to the fullness of the information which is placed before the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords is it in order in this ancient home of deprived citizens in this context to say that franchise is the very air which our british parliamentary democracy breathes <e> <s> therefore when a bill of this kind comes before parliament it deserves to be looked at with the greatest of respect but also with the greatest of attention <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that intervention because she enables me to repeat the words that i used <e> <s> i specially used very broad terms <e> <s> i said those on official duties <e> <s> i did not say those who are on duties employed by her majestys government on official business <e> <s> i intentionally said official duties and i have no doubt that at the conmittee stage one can define what official duties may be <e>", "<cs> my lords again if i may say so to my noble friend whose views i obviously respect as will the house this is a question of defining those who should have the privilege of a vote and this can be dealt with possibly at subsequent stages of the bill <e> <s> the main point that i made was this to put under a very broad umbrella all those who happened to be resident abroad for whatever reason they have left our shores seems to be a very wrong thing to do especially when all of us know that some of our citizens have <e>", "<cs> my lords it would indeed be a difficult thing to decide who of our citizens evaded tax and who did not <e>", "<cs> my lords it may very well do so <e> <s> but if you had a category of those who are resident abroad for reasons of business for reasons which are useful to this country and the category that i spoke of and that we all speak of with great respect the forces the diplomatic corps you can go on beyond that quite obviously to those who are on official duties whatever they may be you can obviously define them and you can decide by reason of their decision to reside abroad whether or not others come within those categories <e> <s> i know of no language at all in a statute which would be able to decide who of our citizens resident in this country had paid all the taxes they should or should not <e> <s> if i may continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am flattered by the number of interventions all of which are courteous and helpful <e> <s> i hope i shall be forgiven if because of them i go on for a little longer than i had intended to do out of consideration for your lordships <e> <s> i merely answer the intervention of the noble lord in this way <e> <s> i have at no time suggested that those who fortunately or otherwise do not pay taxes in this country should be excluded from the right to vote if they happen to be living abroad <e> <s> it happens to apply to everyone who has decided not to be resident in this country <e> <s> as i understand the situation they will not be liable to taxation in this country provided the revenue is satisfied that they are in fact now resident abroad <e> <s> i was merely saying that it seems a rather unfortunate state of affairs if within provisions which may have the greatest of justification in certain circumstances we include among those who are entitled to elect a government who decide upon our taxation those who have deliberately left this country in order to avoid taxation <e> <s> that is a very different point if i may say so from that which the noble lord was quite properly making <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is extremely courteous in describing my friends and associates abroad <e> <s> i should like to make it perfectly clear <e> <s> as i hoped i made it clear in my speech that i have nothing but admiration for those resident abroad because of ill-health i did not earlier mention that category but do so now or those who serve this country in industry commerce and in every other way <e> <s> there are the other people and those who unfortunately have to have knowledge of all our british subjects abroad know that they are a fairly sizeable category <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that his very worthy colleague had a hand in his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord lord denning will forgive me if i am wrong in the remarks that i am now going to make but i make them having read the clause and having listened with my usual respect to what he said <e> <s> as i understand it this clause in no way gives the law society the power to award compensation <e> <s> in no way can it award damages <e> <s> i can well remember that this was discussed on an amendment which was previously before us and we decided i think wisely that it was not for this tribunal to award damages or compensation <e> <s> that was a matter obviously for the civil courts <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact and one i suppose that mystifies the lay community that lawyers can get up and make extremely clear speeches with varying definitions of what the average british subject would describe as fairly clear english <e> <s> this is i think such a case <e> <s> this new section as i understand it was meant it was its whole purpose to supply a short sharp remedy so that the layman the client could go with a complaint to the law society in regard to shoddy work to use shorthand english and the law society could then make a direction telling the solicitor to do something <e> <s> that direction is mentioned in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked that question before i sat down and so i remain standing to answer it <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord most unusually has wrongly interpreted the section the nature of the complaint and the direction that would be given <e> <s> it would be open to argument at all events that where the council did not take into account and i repeat as they should have done arguments that might have been advanced as to the nature of the work and how it should be done the action of the solicitor and so on it would be possible to ask for leave to go to the court for a judicial review i imagine <e> <s> all that this says is that the short sharp procedure shall be a short sharp procedure and that if the solicitor the member of the law society does not obey the direction he has full power to make representations before the direction is given it will be a matter that any person can report to the tribunal and will be a disciplinary matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask only one respectful question of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> if this has the effect of being an order of the high court is it not then appealable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can usefully add anything except to repeat that this is not a power which is given to the law society to suspend a solicitor to say that he has acted in a gravely serious manner <e> <s> that is a matter for the disciplinary committee <e> <s> it is purely a short sharp remedy where applicable that he shall either pay back some costs he should not charge some costs or he should put something right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord for the courteous way in which he has dealt with this amendment <e> <s> but i am sure he will not mind my saying that it has left a difficulty for those of us who are concerned that parliament should do its duty to see that this serious inroad is properly supervised and that it does so in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that the noble and learned lord would give me an opportunity of looking into this reply which of course i have heard for the first time in regard to the point that i made <e> <s> in the circumstances may i have the permission of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very generous invitation from the noble and learned lord that i should not press this amendment <e> <s> if i may say so i regret the advice which the noble and learned lord has confided in us that he had in regard to this matter because i was hoping that this would not be an amendment that was opposed <e> <s> it is one thing to have a series of rules brought in to guide a profession and quite another to find that conduct has occurred which has not been provided for in those rules but which the profession itself would regard as not being in accordance with the standards that it would expect of its members <e> <s> that is a rule that certainly applies to my profession and to others and i had hoped that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that from my point of view and i have listened with great care to the courteous reply of the noble and learned lord a matter of very distinct principle is involved <e> <s> we are setting up a new service <e> <s> it is absolutely vital for the public to know that if they have reason to complain about the behaviour of a member of this new service they do not have to take the decision of an investigating committee as final but in regard to any refusal or neglect if they so wish they are entitled to refer their complaint to the disciplinary committee directly and say please we think that it is an offence that you should look at <e> <s> of course it could find that there is no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor have completely interpreted the purpose of my amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful to both of them <e> <s> it is purely and simply to see that control is vested that is the essential part in the licensed conveyancers in regard to any body that may be formed <e> <s> i am most glad to accept the offer of the noble and learned lord to look at this matter i hope i am not wrong in saying with sympathy in the hope of putting into the bill wording that is better than the wording in my amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister take it that we on these benches wish to make quite clear a position that has not been clarified up to now <e> <s> does he know that the policy of the opposition is that the truth should be told to the people about the terrible consequences of nuclear war <e> <s> if they were told that and knew that the situation was a little more helpful if they were to indulge in civil defence activities elsewhere he might have more volunteers <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to be extremely brief in endeavouring to put the view of my noble friends on this important amendment <e> <s> the case for this amendment was put most succinctly by the noble and learned lord lord denning and if i may say so in somewhat graphic terms but most feelingly by the noble and learned lord lord scarman in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to be even more brief than the noble lord lord foot who moved this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor referred in a previous debate to a division between logic and common sense <e> <s> he came down on the side of common sense because in that amendment he felt that there was a different approach if one looked at the matter from a logical point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad that this matter is being approached in a completely non-controversial non-hostile spirit and that your lordships are in fact considering perfectly quietly the following question should something which has stood the test of time which has not been attacked in any way from the point of view of justice not being done be altered unless there are overwhelming reasons for altering it <e> <s> the question in my submission is as simple as that although it does relate obviously to a most important subject a most important procedure namely the one way as a rule in which the subject has the right to challenge the administrative decisions and other decisions of the executive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is so kind to give way <e> <s> would he explain to the house what these words mean if indeed they have been misunderstood <e> <s> i am looking at subsection b of his amendment which says <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house the noble and learned lord is even more kind to give way a second time but would he take it from me at all events and i say this in all humility that this is not a case of ambiguity <e> <s> many of us have been misled i am sure unintentionally by this wording <e> <s> the wording is quite clear <e> <s> it says in clear terms that the application for leave can only be renewed before the court of appeal if and it accentuates it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord generously wrote to me and said that the spirit of this amendment was one that he could understand and might well consider favourably <e> <s> i hope i am paraphrasing his letter correctly <e> <s> it may not be that an amendment can be brought forward by the government in this house although that would be the attempt but at least the spirit of this might well be met in another place <e> <s> if that be the correct interpretation of what he said and i notice that the noble and learned lord is nodding it would be quite wrong of me to <e>", "<cs> my lords we entirely agree with the necessity and the advantageous nature of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat the comment that i made on the last series of amendments <e> <s> this too is very necessary and very sensible <e>", "<cs> the franks committee my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues is he advocating the disappearance of juries from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord really must not get away with this <e> <s> will he kindly deal with the following question <e> <s> would he not agree that all of us and this is a british tradition even regret the death of our foes <e> <s> we want to know could it have been avoided should it have been avoided <e> <s> and we want to know the truth <e> <s> is that fallible is that wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up this interesting and at times intriguing debate on behalf of the official opposition i should like to repeat the thanks that were accorded at the very beginning of this debate to the noble lord lord wigoder for having put down the motion before the house and for having made as is usual for him a most interesting speech <e> <s> we have gone into the history of this act <e> <s> we heard just now a most amusing description of how parliament dealt with the bill <e> <s> from these benches i could wish that in future we had debates on our bills which were somewhat midway between what happened on that occasion and what happens so often these days <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question which i hope will be more concise and less controversial than those already asked <e> <s> will the film endeavour to tell the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords modesty is always a very acceptable virtue in your lordships house but i think that the noble lord lord morris was too modest when he referred to his contribution at committee stage as being a muddled one <e> <s> it was not but he has made the position abundantly clear today <e> <s> perhaps i may add an observation or two <e> <s> there is a possibility of a problem arising in the future because of the difference between the terms of section as amended and section if it remains unamended <e> <s> however i should not like anyone to think certainly not the noble and learned lord that section was regarded by my profession as anything other than very worthwhile in its aim to protect the public <e> <s> with the noble lord lord morris i wonder whether now that the bill will undoubtedly be travelling on its voyage down the corridor consideration could not be given to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> perhaps i may be permitted to express what i know is the gratitude of the law society for the great courtesy extended by the noble and learned lords department in relation to this amendment as they do generally <e>", "<cs> my lords there are only a few observations that i have to make and frankly i would not have made them had not the noble and learned lord lord denning i know he will forgive me if i say this intervened in the way that he did on certain parts of this bill <e> <s> we are used to the expression that the voice of the turtle has been heard in the land and a

accompanied by the congratulations of the whole house on his new responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say this personally i hope we shall enjoy the same amicable hostility and indeed the same complete personal mutual trust that i had the privilege of enjoying with his predecessor to whom we also wish well in regard to his new position <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a broadcast there but i did not actually hear it <e> <s> in regard to any increase one immediately and sympathetically thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister finally sits down will he forgive me if i repeat a question that i asked him but which he obviously overlooked in his reply <e> <s> i asked him to explain if he could or give some instance of what is meant by the phrase at the top of page of my copy of the statement that the committee <e>", "<cs> one always listens with every conceivable respect to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and to the noble and learned lord lord denning but i venture to suggest that on this occasion the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has taken the committee through his interpretation of the convention and this bill in a perfectly fair way but that there is a completely different way of looking at the matter which does not have the dire effects which he forecast to the committee of breaching the convention and making the bill unenforceable <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee will forgive me if i come back to the argument dealt with by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in his last speech <e> <s> we are adding nothing to the duties of the convention other than to see that there is proper information before all the duties cast by the convention itself are carried out <e> <s> i wonder whether the committee will bear with me and whether the noble and learned lord will exercise his usual patience if i tell him that i have come recently from a case which i believe is very much in point <e> <s> obviously there will be no names mentioned or anything else that could identify those involved although it was a case that was decided eventually by the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> i ventured to disagree with the conclusion of the noble and learned lord concerning the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull although i could not quarrel with what the noble and learned lord then said was the procedure normally adopted by our courts <e> <s> it would have been a gross impertinence for me to have differed from him on such a subject <e>", "<cs> i shall say how content i am with what the noble and learned lord said <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may make one small contribution in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord is considering the whole matter <e> <s> one of the things that worry me is that anybody reading this bill when it becomes an act will on looking at the wording of subsection of clause take it for granted that something has gone wrong with his copy of the print of the act because he will go through it and find there is an article and a but no <e> <s> not having had the benefit of the noble and learned lords explanation before him he will either blame her majestys stationery office which has printed his copy of the bill wrongly or blame parliament for having done something rather foolish in passing a bill which leaves out article of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may rise immediately to make the position of the opposition quite clear <e> <s> on second reading i ventured to say we had to be very careful before the franchise was given in any way to those who had deliberately left our shores in order to avoid taxation and those who had also left our shores in order to avoid coming before our criminal courts <e> <s> it appeared to me and to my noble friends that it would be very wrong to give a vote to people who came within those categories <e> <s> if it were possible to limit in specific terms in this bill and i believe the amendment has succeeded in doing that certainly the amendments we are talking about at this stage to see that the franchise was given without limitation in regard to years to those officials of the institutions of the european community the opposition would listen to such a case with the greatest of sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make my position abundantly clear <e> <s> in my view anyone who goes abroad in order to avoid paying tax in this country does not deserve the franchise <e> <s> i am not casting any moral aspersions nor referring to any judgment of any learned

and deserves the title that i gave him <e> <s> we are most grateful to him for that dissertation on the law and certainly for the conclusion that he reached which <e>", "<cs> i recognise the principle

serious cases the county court judge would obviously refuse relief and hand the papers over to the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> if i may say so and i say this with the utmost deference i can only interpret his remarks as being somewhat derogatory to the standing of county court judges who surely are able to deal with these matters which are not terribly complex in regard to law in exactly the same way as a high court judge <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has acted with his usual courtesy and kindness and i merely ask him if he will kindly see that the letter reaches me at least before report stage so that i can consider my position <e> <s> i ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister take it that the house is very concerned about the creation of bad will in a territory where we should be creating as much good will as we can <e> <s> will he also consider that the title of this act contains the word emergency and that the emergency in question the rent and rates strike finished in <e> <s> lastly will he look at the question of appeal which is not known or publicised in northern ireland and is limited to an informal tribunal which has no statutory force to examine cases of hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will forgive me for returning to the dispatch box <e> <s> will he assure the house that copies of the series of letters which he will now be signing will also be in the library <e> <s> will he take it from the questions that he has been asked that this is a matter upon which ministers who are dealing with it ought to be fully briefed in future because the house regards it as a very important matter indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl the minister accept that it is a little difficult on this side when questions as relevant as that of my noble friend are asked and she is told that it is wide of the question <e> <s> how can an endowment fund which is there and its future be irrelevant to the question of proposals for disposing of the hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for the clear way in which he has explained these regulations to the house <e> <s> i wonder whether i may be permitted to comment upon them first in general terms and then in somewhat more particular terms <e> <s> shades of the debates which took place on the police and criminal evidence act i have no doubt are present in this chamber this afternoon happily i do not speak of the shades of those who participated in that debate because so far as i know they are all alive and well <e> <s> it would be idle of me to pretend that there was unanimity in the house when the new procedures for the reception of complaints against police were debated in your lordships house <e> <s> no one would therefore expect me to talk in terms of an ideal solution having been reached but as parliament has had its say it would be wrong of me to do anything other than to examine the situation as it now is <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances the noble lord will not be interrupting me <e> <s> nevertheless i thank him for his courtesy <e> <s> i thought he was trying to interrupt me and i wanted at once to give way as i always would <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister rises to reply i am conscious of the fact that i threw some points at him without any notice <e> <s> if he finds himself in the slightest degree embarrassed becauses of lack of notice i shall well understand if he wants to write to me so long as obviously the usual procedure applies of the letters being available in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will permit me it may very well be that further reflection must be given to this <e> <s> my point was twofold <e> <s> of course i understand that somebody would have to consider very carefully medical evidence and everything else but if you have a time limit you have to be very certain as to when the time limit starts <e> <s> that was my first point <e> <s> how anyone will know in fact when it first becomes clear to the appropriate authority that the complaint was one to which that paragraph applies to me if i may say so humbly is certainly not clear <e> <s> indeed i do not know how anybody can ever tell whether that was the day or whether it was not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is most courteous but why does he assume in the course of a very lucid but as far as i can see bad argument so far that the committee of inquiry will find so much in this bill that is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord for repeating a statement made in another place but i believe that your lordships will find that it is a very regrettable statement <e> <s> the fact of the matter must be that the government made a mistake in the drawing up of this order <e> <s> it is a very important order because a ballot paper will not be issued to a voter who has taken the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord the minister for what he has said <e> <s> he has gone as far as he possibly can with his limited remit and i quite understand that but i hope that this promise to do everything that is possible will be translated into practice <e> <s> at the moment i do not have a reasonable explanation as to why amending legislation cannot be rushed through so that an error can be corrected <e> <s> at the same time i am perfectly sure that the department can try to see to it that the new medical cards are substituted for the old in as many cases as possible so as to limit the amount of harm that is done <e> <s> it really is incumbent upon the secretary of state i say this with all the emphasis that i can command to do everything however inconvenient it may be to put right this wrong otherwise we shall be seriously interfering with a very important democratic right in an area where we all want to see it properly exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the minister aware that many of us are delighted that mr louis blom-cooper is chairing the tribunal that will inquire into this terrible happening <e> <s> is she aware also that one of the serious problems which children face in these circumstances is the complete shortage of the social workers who should be available to try and look after them <e> <s> finally will she very much have in mind as i hope that the inquiry will the complaint made by the foster parents at the trial of beckford namely that the social workers had removed the child against the wishes of the foster parents <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will permit an intervention from somebody who had the privilege of sitting in county hall for some years under the old london county council and who was the first chairman of the glcs general purposes committee <e> <s> my intervention is prompted by the fact that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is known in your lordships house as he was known in another place for being a great debater of more than or years experience <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord has had one minutes experience of london government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember the written answer that was given by his right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state in another place when he then said that he hoped to be making a further statement before too long and eulogised the idea of community radio as one that would <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister who is always very patient but he has not answered the question i put to him <e> <s> will the experiments which are to take place lead to advertising being permitted even before peacock recommends as to whether the insertion of advertising revenue and the carrying of advertisements on radio stations programmes will affect standards <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and indeed any noble lord is absolutely entitled to ask a question of this kind cannot the effect of replies to such questions and the very raising of them be both misleading and mischievous <e> <s> can it not raise the whole question of the powers and duties of the parole board and the way it carries them out and the conduct of the home secretary in agreeing or otherwise with the recommendations of the parole board <e> <s> would it not be wiser to leave matters in the hands of the parole board and the home secretary bearing in mind that each case is different and each ought to be judged on its own merits <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister and all your lordships accept a protest from me that after i had made perfectly clear that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was entitled to ask the question as indeed would be any noble lord his remarks do not measure up to his usual fairness and accuracy <e>", "<cs> my lords it was extremely courteous of the noble lord lord hams of greenwich to anticipate that i would want to speak before he did <e> <s> i just wanted to make absolutely sure that the liberal party and the sdp were of one mind in this matter and therefore i waited for his speech <e> <s> i find that the alliance is truly an alliance and that they hold the same point of view <e> <s> i can now reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that intervention but all of us know that excepted from all extradition treaties are offences which relate to fiscal matters <e> <s> there are therefore many offences which will not come within the purview of an extradition treaty glad though i am to know that that treaty is going to be signed <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the mistakes of an intervention although the noble lord well knows that i am more than happy always to give way to him or any other noble lord is that sometimes the intervention takes place before the original speaker has a chance of completing the point he was trying to make <e> <s> i was certainly not limiting what i had to say to seven or eight people <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord harris presumably knows these people so well that he was even able to give the number <e> <s> i was not able myself to say how many such people there were in spain or elsewhere <e> <s> i was obviously adding that up in regard to all the ec countries and mentioning spain as an example only because of the media emphasis on spain having been used in the past as a retreat for some of the people to whom i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the strictures always mildy given by the noble baroness about those who said that it was completely unconstitutional for matters of franchise to be dealt with in this house were not applied to me <e> <s> i made it absolutely clear that whereas i thought that it was constitutionally possible and perfectly proper my only comment was that in my view the last word in regard to elections to that body should remain with that body and i used the words deliberately <e>", "<cs> my lords in all deference it is one of the privileges of those who do not have responsibility either for the government or for the opposition to bring forward adventurous and sometimes extremely worthy resolutions and amendments <e> <s> if one has responsibility either in government or in an opposition that hopes to be the government then one obviously has to say that despite the many worthy arguments to support the proposition that those who have the vote should have the right to sit a proposition for which speaking personally i have the greatest sympathy responsibility points to the matter not being incorpo-rated in this bill in this house in this way <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will kindly forgive me <e>

friend the leader of the opposition take a very <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness who has just explained so lucidly and so movingly the contents of this bill described her honourable friend mr neville trotter the member for tynemouth who was responsible for having guided the bill through the commons as having achieved a great deal through his persuasiveness and charm <e> <s> i should like the noble baroness to know that we who know her so well think that the honourable gentlemen has nothing on the noble baroness for either of those qualities <e> <s> therefore i am sure that this bill when passing through your lordships house will have the same happy and speedy passage as it did in the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords while obviously the learned lord chief justice is all knowing is it not a fact that the provisions of the copyright amendment act were not referred to him at the trial of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords there are but three matters following upon this tragic event at bradford which the house i believe would want to concentrate upon <e> <s> the first is certainly speaking on behalf of my noble friends but knowing that i speak on behalf of the whole house that our hearts go out to the bereaved and the injured <e> <s> secondly together with the noble lord the minister to whom we are most grateful for repeating this statement we would want to say that we so much admire the action on this occasion of the police the fire brigade and all those services who joined in to do what they could in this terrible tragedy <e> <s> perhaps i may also be allowed to mention in this context the reports that were definitely conveyed through the media of the nurses off duty who speedily rushed to the hospital and also many members of the public who at some danger to themselves immediately threw themselves into the task of a rescue operation doing all that they could <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before the noble lord sits down only because it is so important i might mention this <e> <s> he said that the guidelines that were affecting football grounds at the moment made it clear that exit doors should be kept open <e> <s> may i remind him of the disconcerting statement made in the course of what he himself read out which the secretary of state has obviously given to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords a further letter <e>", "<cs> oh please <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not do it with arms folded but what i will do is to remind the noble lord the minister though i should have thought that he needed no reminder of the convention of this house which is that you do not read correspondence to the whole of the house without the full permission of the person concerned <e> <s> unfortunately the noble lord the minister started by doing it and suggested that my noble friend might have been inaccurate which is a neutral phrase that i should like to use <e> <s> my noble friend was accordingly driven to reply that there was a further letter in order to show that he was not inaccurate <e> <s> but i would beg both noble lords if i may respectfully say so not to quote correspondence unless there is a direct authority by the person who wrote the letter so to quote <e>", "<cs> this amendment moved with his usual skill and clarity by the noble lord lord renton will not i hope be met with constitutional arguments namely that this is a joining up of services that would be contrary to the whole principle of the bill <e> <s> i should be so displeased if the noble lord were met with that argument a pretty weak one in any event because i have amendments down in my name that go precisely to the same end <e> <s> i should therefore find myself allied with the noble lord lord renton in defeat instead of what i hope will be the case allied in victory <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i wish only to make the position entirely clear <e> <s> there is a grouping of various amendments in my name and that

noble lord lord renton is masterly he will do precisely the same so far as i am concerned because it would help <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add to the general acclaim which i hear from the govenment benches for the noble concession made by the minister <e> <s> perhaps i may point out that these amendments were put down with exactly the same purpose and it would have been within the normal graciousness of the noble lord the minister if he had recognised that and had merely said that the spirit of both sets of amendments was accepted rather than to have said merely because the noble lord lord renton is his very good and noble friend and i envy him that friendship and i hope that i share it that amendment is accepted and the others are redundant because they come from this front bench <e> <s> that does not meet with the usual graciousness for which the noble lord has now become very well known <e>", "<cs> i rise for the last time <e> <s> i accept that the joint arguments of the

for humility on behalf of the noble lord lord plummer and who happily engaged in the service of london have both united on opposite sides of your lordships committee and in the light of their long experience in favour of this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> i accept as will your lordships the sincerity of the statements made by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i think the country would be a little happier in accepting these brave assertions if they did not run contrary to the advice of those engaged in these matters on the practical front as well as on the political front <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister and his government had decided to have behind them the force of an inquiry and a royal commission or whatever it might be before embarking on these reckless exercises the country would listen to such assertions with a great deal more sympathy understanding and confidence <e>", "<cs> would that i could reply in as short terms <e> <s> i think that the noble lord the minister who has replied to me in the way that he has and i am most grateful to him for taking the trouble to do so has ignored the fact that the bill gives the secretary of state as i understand clause the power to control for at least three years the budgets of the new police and fire authorities <e> <s> he is also and your lordships might not have understood that from his reply able to direct the manpower levels the external servicing and the internal management schemes of the new authorities if i have correctly understood clause and we are looking to see how from the point of view of the economics of the country these things are being dealt with especially with the secretary of states powers <e> <s> i thought therefore that when i said why not <e> <s> the noble lord the minister was going to reply why not <e> <s> and that this amendment was accordingly going to be agreed to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord never bores me nor does any member of the committee <e> <s> infrequently he does enlighten me <e> <s> obviously i am going to study very carefully what the noble lord has said but i wonder whether in his kindness he would equally consider the possibility of even publishing these annual reports for parliament during the interim period <e> <s> i do not require his answer now i am merely asking whether he would kindly consider that matter <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while there may have been no commitment to release is it not a fact that the policy announced in october has in fact meant retrospectively that prison sentences are now longer for these people than they otherwise would have been <e> <s> is not such a retrospective decision however much we may deplore the crimes committed contrary to the rules of natural justice <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be permitted one further supplementary question would it not be a little more just and a little more hopeful for the hopeless to indicate that there will be an examination of each case on its merits <e>", "<cs> you normally do <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the prison population in this country risen to a record figure of have not the latest figures of those on remand shown an increase of some per cent <e> <s> and has not the secretary of state announced that he needs to recruit more prison officers <e> <s> does not all this including the answer to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich show a most critical state in our prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords as is typical of him the noble viscount the lord president of the council if i may say so in marked contrast to his right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for the home department in another place introduced this bill in the soft strains of a schubert symphony i say in parenthesis immediately that i chose schubert in order to maintain the alliteration <e> <s> i say in marked contrast because his right honourable and learned friend in another place used instead the strident tones it was a mixture of brass wind and percussion usually associated with a wagnerian overture <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the ability to march and demonstrate is all part of a british tradition <e> <s> would he not accept from me that it enables a lot of people to get rid of a lot of steam in regard to something about which they feel fervently and is therefore a good reason why they should not indulge in any other rather more energetic enterprise which may indeed lead to a breach of public order <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble lord i hope with his full permission <e> <s> i want to say only this <e> <s> he has so much more eloquently than i made the very point which he will see if he has the kindness to

there were more members of your lordships house present devoting some hours of our time because this is the place where justice rules not only in our courts but in our parliament when we legislate and when we revise as we do in this house <e> <s> it is a wonderful example of our traditions that pleas should be listened to on behalf of people who have been convicted in our courts before a judge and jury and whose appeals have been dismissed before the court of criminal appeal as it then was that there is still the right of the citizen to ask people who are public-spirited and all those who have participated in this debate have been public-spirited to come and plead the cause of a review of the situation because they believe that justice was not done <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord

does not lessen that respect although i thought that he was less than his usual self on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly because i am sure the committee does not wish to extend this debate any further <e> <s> the noble lord asked me a question dealing with the legal aspects of the function of the secretary of state <e> <s> i refer him not just to the speech that my noble and learned friend made which i am sure he will read in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the usual courtesy of this house may i thank the noble lord the minister for having repeated the statement made by his right honourable friend in the other place <e> <s> i ask for the forgiveness of the house if because of the grave constitutional and humane considerations that apply to this statement i speak for longer than i normally do in reply to a statement which is made in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister leaves that point whether it be hours or hours is he seriously suggesting that that is a reasonable time for public representatives to take instructions and to make sure that the facts that reach the home office have been checked and that the proper case is made on behalf of these people <e> <s> is this the sort of time limit that the home secretary feels to be just and equitable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness forgive me if i return to the supplementary question that was asked by my noble friend lord cledwyn the leader of the opposition <e> <s> may i emphasise to her and to the house the propriety of that question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i question whether her reply was a correct one bearing in mind that the question relates very clearly to the governments association or disassociation with the policies of the south african government and merely includes the constitution <e> <s> would she therefore be good enough to reply to my noble friends supplementary question <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the noble viscount for the clear way in which he has explained these amendments <e> <s> there is only one controversial issue in regard to this amendment to which i ought to draw the committees attention and it is one that was raised very specifically in another place and by the noble and learned lord lord denning in this house at second reading <e> <s> the concern was that in the bill as it is before your lordships and prior to this amendment and i am referring of course to clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may beg to differ from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is so rarely that anybody in this house has the courage to do so that i had indeed to invigorate myself in getting up and deciding to have that courage <e> <s> i wonder whether this is right <e> <s> we now know that if somebody wishes to have a call intercepted because it is offensive that is dealt with very simply by talking to the exchange and asking that it be done because there is a nuisance or sometimes by calling in the police and getting their guidance about asking the exchange <e> <s> but there are other ways in which with the permission of one or other party calls are regularly and properly intercepted <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon what the noble viscount has just said i understand that one of the learned justices of appeal who sits with the noble and learned lord lord denning once described himself in the wording of another act as a consenting adult in public <e> <s> therefore i echo what the noble viscount has said in regard to not trying to improve on the advocacy of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> it may be too long but one sees where it is going if one follows the wording of the convention <e> <s> this committee would never agree to the following words because after talking about national security i shall deal with economic well-being in a moment the convention goes on to say <e>", "<cs> i shall not continue the debate with the noble lord although i always enjoy having discussions with him whether inside or outside this chamber <e> <s> i think he may find that he is wrong and that there is no right of judicial review in regard to this matter whether administrative or on a point of law <e> <s> if i am wrong and the noble lord proves it to me outside this chamber i will make an apology on an appropriate occasion when we are discussing this bill <e> <s> but the courts of law are out which is why the tribunal is given certain powers <e>", "<cs> i am very sensitive to the remarks that were made by the noble viscount as to the responsibility which he bears and the difficulty in going into more detail than he has done <e> <s> i in no way want to upset that sensitivity because with the responsibility that i hope we always feel from this front bench it would be wrong of me to do so in view of the words that he has used <e>", "<cs> i think the noble viscount has been very gracious in his reply to this debate <e> <s> i hope he will <e>", "<cs> will the noble viscount make me one promise that is that in the same way that he appears to have ignored the noble and learned lord lord denning when he supported me he will give consideration to ignoring him equally when he opposes me <e> <s> against that promise i certainly intend to have a very close look at what the noble viscount has said to consider it very carefully and to see whether something by way of an alternative or whatever it may be should be brought forward at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> but at the present moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount has said this amendment is based upon discussions in another place <e> <s> the amendment is obviously a worthy one and we support it <e>", "<cs> this noble lord is indeed very grateful to the noble viscount for what he has promised to do <e> <s> on the basis of that promise i am more than happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> for the very first time the noble viscount has disappointed me in regard to his reply <e> <s> i want very briefly to say why i regard this matter as being one of principle <e> <s> i believe that those who have <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the profession to which i have the honour to belong i could wish that the noble viscount had been a member of it because he would have been a most distinguished member in view of the gentle advocacy which he has just practised <e> <s> obviously it would be discourteous of me to resist it <e> <s> however will he permit me only so that the matter can be properly investigated because it deserves it to answer the noble and learned lord as he knows i always do most respectfully <e>", "<cs> it was if i may say so off the wrong cuff on this occasion <e> <s> i say that for this reason <e> <s> the noble and learned lord had not noticed that there was also an amendment to which i spoke in regard to clause which reads <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is always most gracious in the way that he accepts any corrections <e> <s> the corrections have been rare during his lifetime although they have been given from time to time by your lordships house <e> <s> having said that and in view of the very gracious words of the noble viscount it would be wrong of me to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i believe he is seized of the fact that this is an important point to which his earlier remarks were not an answer <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the court of appeal has varied the decision which it made a few moments ago and the court of appeal has the power to do that provided that it is at the same sitting <e>", "<cs> for the first time i have had acclaim for something that i have said in the course of the conduct of this stage of the bill and i am delighted <e> <s> however the noble viscount has said that this obviously should be considered <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has said that it is a question of drafting and one ought to give proper consideration to what has been said <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment upon the understanding which i think we all have as to what we want to do in regard to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i not only take notice of them they have registered on my mind with great emphasis <e> <s> i wonder however whether the noble viscount can help me in this regard <e> <s> if he can then i propose to take a certain course which he can anticipate <e> <s> i wonder whether he can give an assurance or if he feels that to be wrong because i have given him no notice of this at least to consider favourably the suggestion that guidelines could be given to the tribunal saying that if they find that there has been an apparent contravention then suitable guidance can be given to the applicant <e> <s> we would not then need necessarily to have it in the statute because i take some of the things that the noble viscount said <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may at once say that there are aspects of this matter which have been outlined by the noble viscount which had not occurred to me at the time i tabled this amendment <e> <s> i should like to consider them and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> may i say <e>", "<cs> may i at once thank the noble viscount for the gracious way in which he accepted part of the argument which i tried to advance in support of this amendment <e> <s> i repeat that it was as a result of reading the <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount knows i have considerable respect for what he has said in his last few phrases <e> <s> the noble viscount speaks from a wealth of experience which was put at the disposal of this country and which has been very much appreciated <e> <s> having said that i still believe there was some substance in what i put forward by way of argument in regard to this amendment <e> <s> i still believe that although one may want to reduce the term of imprisonment from three years to two years then if it were to be as the noble and learned lord lord denning said always to be treated as a serious crime i would have thought that linking it to some form of anticipatory punishment and making that cumulative but not alternative might be the way of seeing to it that proper consideration was given to the nature of the crime before it was considered to be serious <e>", "<cs> i am a proud member of a profession which over the past year or two has been accused of being monopolistically minded and the closest of closed shops that ever was <e> <s> i hope that my speech tonight and the amendment that i have moved prove those accusations to be false <e> <s> having proved how false they are i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> i know the noble and learned lord lord denning will pardon me if i point out that there is a <e>", "<cs> in the course of the noble viscounts courteous and lengthy reply to this amendment i noted the words most of what is heard is not listened to or remembered <e> <s> i assure him that that does not apply to his speech in my case but i feel i ought to see the written word and study it rather than take it for granted that i have listened to and remembered all that <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recall that in introducing this bill the noble lord lord morris noted with admiration the mental agility of various ladies who had six cards in front of them and operated them at the same time as discussing the relative merits of their spouses or members of their families <e> <s> i should like to tell the noble lord that the house has an equal admiration for his mental agility in the way in which he presented this bill to your lordships <e> <s> it is a matter with which this house is familiar because the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls tried to introduce a similar measure <e> <s> i want the noble lord to know that i have carried out enough research to know that this is known as link bingo <e> <s> with regard to link bingo the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls dealt with allowing the various clubs to join together on a regional or national basis in order that the monies could be pooled the present limit i believe being a week although allowing the linking obviously made it impracticable for clubs to be able to attract on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches but purely in a personal capacity since this is a private members bill perhaps i may pay my respects first of all to the honourable member for plymouth miss janet fookes who fought the battle for this bill with some valour in another place and who has a worthy colleague if i may say so in the noble baroness lady vickers who has just with equal valour and clarity moved the second reading of this bill in your lordships house <e> <s> let me make it perfectly clear from the very start that it would be a peculiar person who spoke in favour of kerb crawling and who did not want to abolish that nuisance from the streets of our urban areas where it has become a very great nuisance indeed <e> <s> it would also be a peculiar person who felt that in regard to the offences where the penalties have been increased that was not a very sensible measure having regard again to the criminal activities that have taken place in this very lamentable area of our criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords i only interrupt the noble lord to agree with him <e> <s> it is indeed the suggestion that i myself made <e> <s> i entirely agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope the noble and learned lord will realise that i would never interrupt a speech of his unless i thought i was helping him <e> <s> he may not know that there was an undertaking that clause should not form part of the bill and the noble baroness lady vickers so announced <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister forgive me for intervening only so that we have clarification <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning was i think he will correct me if i am wrong taking it for granted that the only evidence that would be required and indeed the only time a charge would be brought under this clause would be if a policeman were to say that woman who was approached by that man in that motor car was a prostitute and i knew her as such <e> <s> is the minister saying that the ambit of this clause goes far wider than that and that it includes perfectly respectable women who are approached from a car <e> <s> if that is so my example is a pertinent one <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord denning is right and it always has to be a prostitute known as such to the officer then the example i gave is wrong but the minister would also be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> i only want to emphasise that as the government understand the position and as they are advised it is an offence under clause of the bill whatever be the definition of the words for the purpose of prostitution if somebody driving a car by the kerbside approaches a woman whom he thinks is a prostitute but in fact is not or if somebody approaches a prostitute and she is a prostitute or indeed if somebody approaches a woman not knowing whether she is a prostitute but hoping that he can turn her into one <e> <s> all those offences presumably as the minister is saying are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> this is the last time that i shall intervene <e> <s> i shall not argue the point further <e> <s> however i believe that it would be a matter of grave concern to the noble and learned lord lord denning to hear the observations that have been made <e> <s> his speech as i understood it was directed to a different interpretation to that given by the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may rise before the noble baroness sits down <e> <s> i am not competent to speak on behalf of the usual channels and i doubt whether the usual channels are available further to inform us this afternoon <e> <s> however having regard to the important and quite lengthy debate which has taken place on this friday afternoon raising many points which must be looked at carefully in committee i express merely a personal point of view and i should like to hear the views of the noble lord lord wigoder on this it might not be most appropriate to deal with this bill in the dinner hour <e> <s> having said that i must not discuss the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this moment ought to pass without the whole house paying its tribute to the noble baroness lady macleod for piloting a very useful bill for the protection of youngsters in regard to the very dreadful and dangerous habit of glue sniffing and for seeing that those who intentionally make money out of this kind of thing suffer for it and come within the purview of our criminal law <e> <s> the noble baroness is to be congratulated <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> the lord chief justice is of course a noble and learned friend of all of us but he sits as is appropriate on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches may i say at once how much we appreciate the fact that the noble lord lord rodney took over this task from the noble lord lord mancroft <e> <s> we join with him in wishing lord mancroft a speedy and complete recovery and we would say to lord mancroft that he had a very worthy substitute in the way this bill was moved on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that point and perhaps what i am going to say ought to be the subject of correpondence rather than an oral answer now <e> <s> but is the noble baroness able to indicate whether the constraints which the commissioner has mentioned will have some effect upon the announcement she has made concerning the priorities which are being set by the commissioner and other chief police officers in respect of the catching of drug traffickers and the establishment which she also announced which the metropolitan police commissioner and other chief constables have <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> if i may follow as i hope i do the noble lord the minister my understanding is that my noble friend lord carmichael will be speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> af aj ak and ac <e> <s> i shall be speaking to the rest of the amendments until amendment no <e> <s> ah <e> <s> i shall however be asking for the opinion of the house to be taken in regard to the police separately from that in regard to fire and civil defence <e> <s> i believe that the house would wish to take those matters separately although the case for them may be very much the same <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister continues i wonder whether he would help me in the same way as i was trying to help him in having this matter dealt with tidily <e> <s> what i thought was i should love him to agree or disagree that the opinion of the house and therefore the debate ought to be limited first to the police then to fire and then to transport <e> <s> otherwise we shall have speeches on transport on fire and civil defence which will muddy the whole issue <e> <s> to be frank i regard the police as possibly the most important although i do not in any way diminish the importance of civil defence fire and transport <e> <s> however they are separate issues and i therefore do not want them to be muddied by a mixed debate as i said <e> <s> in my speech i tried to talk only about the police and i wonder whether the noble lord the minister may agree that it is proper to do the same in his <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt for the very last time but i am trying to get things clear for the future <e> <s> i want to make it abundantly clear that not over the weekend when i was abroad but certainly not in the course of this morning did i receive any message about the groupings this is after all an amendment to which my name is attached as is the name of the noble lord lord inglewood but if the noble lord the minister had indulged in the often more convenient channels of a personal call to me i should have told him at any time this morning that the police were being taken separately from civil defence and fire and that transport was also being taken separately <e> <s> i regret that we were not in touch <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues i was very careful to say and i am sure that he heard me that i would not quote what the noble viscount lord whitelaw had said without two precautions first of all a courtesy call to his office to say that i would be quoting from this report of what he was supposed to have said and secondly that i obtained information that the transcript of the interview was sent to the noble viscount before publication for any observations that he had to make <e> <s> my report is that he had no such observations <e> <s> since i am only relying upon the accuracy of the report for the quotations of what the noble viscount had to say i do not think that the minister ought to take any more joy out of referring to the fact that somebody or other may be taking certain proceedings against the gentleman who edited or compiled that report <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard that as a most welcome introduction to my closing remarks <e> <s> i wonder whether i may summarise the case in literally a couple of minutes before i ask your lordships to decide <e> <s> first this is not a motion that comes to your lordships house as the noble lord the minister at one time inferred in only one sentence from these benches opposite to the noble lord the minister this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is not unaware of the fact which i shall now recite to him namely that in this bill the passing over to the joint boards is something which the police forces of this country have to swallow <e> <s> it is indigestible enough as it is without the noble lord making it a matter of the gravest possible duodenal ulcer by introducing clause into this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tendency that i have noticed the noble lord the minister has had very often <e> <s> but before he accuses me of using a mixed methaphor perhaps i may tell him that there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would be good enough to clarify the situation in regard to what i believe are the cypriots who are in this country and who did not come here immediately after <e> <s> does he know that many of them were in refugee camps and could not get here before they in fact arrived <e> <s> whatever may be the facts of the particular case that my noble friend has brought to the attention of the minister and the house is the governments policy to be merciful to those people and to bring them within the main government policy in regard to cypriot refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be indebted to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the way in which he has presented this bill to your lordships for second reading and that lordships will pay tribute to the kindliness with which he dealt with some quite sad facts <e> <s> having said that and i am merely speaking personally as one always does on bills of this nature there are various factors which trouble me and which with respect and i hope humility i wish to bring to your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may at once say how much i believe the house will follow him in his remarks and will agree with so much of what he has said <e> <s> i tried in language that was not as clear or as eloquent to say rather the same things <e> <s> the reason for my intervention is that i believe the house is faced with a procedural difficulty and i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can help <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down i believe that many of us would be content not to divide and i have already indicated my neutral position from a personal point of view <e> <s> but i believe that the house would want to know with some certainty that this matter will be looked at by a committee that such a procedure will be followed <e> <s> that is why i asked whether my notice of motion that it be referred to a committee so that the matter could be dealt with in that way was acceptable to the house at this moment rather than leave it as it were in limbo <e> <s> therefore with the permission of the house i beg to move <e>", "<cs> yes indeed i note that for the purpose of prostitution is mentioned under the heading of kerb-crawling at page of the report <e> <s> i also notice that later on in the report they use the words for sexual purposes <e> <s> i am saying that for the purpose of prostitution whether or not recommended in the wording of the criminal law revision committee makes a nonsense of this offence <e>", "<cs> i am not sure about the depth of the water but i have no doubt about what the noble marquess has said <e> <s> i have introduced the words for sexual purposes <e> <s> on the assumption that this young man was not asking the lady in question whom he had not previously seen to discuss the current royal shakespeare production that the approach was for sexual purposes that he was overheard and he approached more than one women or persistently approached the same woman he would be committing an offence <e>", "<cs> i can only reply by saying that there is a nuisance which ought to be dealt with in regard to the kerb crawlers and other people who make a nuisance of themselves for this purpose <e> <s> one imagines that prosecutions would only be brought where a nuisance occurs <e> <s> but i am afraid that where the noble marquess and i differ is that i believe there is a nuisance which ought to be dealt with <e> <s> in those circumstances i have incorporated all the factors such as kerb crawling into my amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree <e>", "<cs> it is not that <e> <s> i think that it will help in the debate if most respectfully i make clear from my point of view the two matters that i think the minister has to answer <e> <s> the first one is that i did not just talk of a conviction <e> <s> i have already dealt with the fact that in another place the answer given by the minister was that one ought to have faith in english courts and the evidence would have to be sound enough for a conviction <e> <s> i dealt with the question of a charge of this kind being brought as it is capable of being brought under the clause without persistence and of the dangers to reputations to married life and to family life if that were so <e> <s> that was the first point <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord moves on he talks about <e>", "<cs> i shall not rudely interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> my only excuse is that the minister in another place promised a very full debate on persistently in this house and did so in specific terms <e> <s> therefore i am obviously entitled as it were to carry on <e> <s> but the noble lord the minister is not dealing with my point <e> <s> my point is that before a summons is issued on a private prosecution an application has to be made to the court <e> <s> if you have to have evidence <e>", "<cs> we have been relied upon in this committee to deal with the question of persistency <e> <s> as i have said to the noble lord the minister when he was speaking in another place made it clear that there should be in this chamber a debate and a full discussion on persistency <e> <s> perhaps i may turn to the noble viscount lord hanworth for a moment and i shall be very brief <e> <s> if only the bill before us contained the words that he may like to see in it namely that it is an offence only if it occurs at certain times of the night or if it happens in a red light area then of course some of my comments may not have been necessary <e> <s> but the bill says no such thing and to say that people who travel at certain times of the night and in certain areas really ought to understand the consequences is with great respect no answer to the wording of this bill which makes no reference to either contingency <e>", "<cs> without the same persuasiveness as my noble friend lord houghton always has when he rises to address the chamber perhaps i may make just two observations <e> <s> i tried to make the same point on second reading i thought that this was the incorrect vehicle for the matters with which we had to deal that a private members bill was not the proper machinery <e> <s> i had in mind very definitely this provision <e>", "<cs> i do not suppose that any of us at this hour wishes to extend the debate beyond the confines of the amendment and the proper protest that has been made by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby and by the noble lord lord monson when moving the amendment <e> <s> i too tried to make out such a protest as humbly as i could but nevertheless as loudly as i could at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness could follow what she has said to deal not with criminal offences but as my noble friend lord bruce of donington was trying to bring out a civil matter namely a civil debt <e> <s> what would be the position where somebody claiming diplomatic immunity failed to pay one of our traders his just due <e> <s> what would be the position <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a question directed to him by my noble friend the noble lord the minister talked in terms of government policy in regard to solicitors and building societies <e> <s> would he say quite firmly that the government will protect the public to see that there is no conflict of interest in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all parts of the house will be united upon three matters <e> <s> the first is on the congratulations to the police forces who have been instrumental in making these discoveries and effecting certain arrests <e> <s> about that there is no doubt and all of us will want to express our gratitude to them <e> <s> the second point upon which i am sure all the house will be united is a further declaration which goes forth very clearly from these benches and all benches in parliament that terrorism and hijacking are not going to be allowed to pay <e> <s> the third matter is that with a full sense of responsibility one does not ask questions which go beyond reasonable probing and which in any way would interfere with the security of our people <e>", "<cs> my lords without making a long speech and without making any comments at question time may i ask the noble baroness what justification in logic there can be for printing comments without printing that upon which the comments are made <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister having regard to the seriousness of the question that was asked by the noble baroness lady masham give a categorical assurance that instructions will be given that in no circumstances are these conditions to be allowed to obtain namely that somebody under the age of who is a prisoner whether on remand or otherwise shall be in the same cell as an older <e>", "<cs> my lords will your lordships forgive me if i return to the dispatch box <e> <s> i do so only because of the seriousness of this question <e> <s> the noble baroness has mentioned on more than one occasion wherever possible and if possible <e> <s> because of the concern shown on all sides of the house is she prepared to take up this matter with the secretary of state with a view to seeing whether there cannot be a prohibition except in the most urgent circumstances in regard to the conditions mentioned in the question asked by the noble baroness <e> <s> will she please speak to her right honourable friend about this and tell him of the great concern shown by this house <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree and i shall try to put this briefly that where the united kingdom signs a convention its word and signature constitute its bond <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister also agree that it is impossible at question time to deal with such general propositions of law as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter attempted to put to your lordships <e> <s> would it not be simpler to say that where the convention is in dispute we will obviously argue our case before the european court of human rights but that as signatories to the convention we respect that court <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister and all your lordships agree that the points raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord renton are much better dealt with by a debate if they wish to have one by arrangment through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> in dealing with this amendment i have only a few brief observations to make <e> <s> first those who are convicted of this crime and who are the heads of one of the wickedest trades that one could ever conceive deserve to be faced with precisely the same punishment as we accord to those who are guilty of murder <e> <s> there may on some occasions be some excuse for murder <e> <s> there is no excuse for those who carry on this trade who are the heads of it and who make millions out of it <e> <s> they traffic in murder for gain <e> <s> whatever else be the arguments they ought to be faced with precisely the same maximum sentence as is accorded to those guilty of murder <e>", "<cs> i am sure the committee will be most grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble and learned lord lord denning for raising a point that has been before your lordships on other occasions and is of great importance namely that these people should not be allowed to get away with their ill-gotten gains <e>", "<cs> i apologise for rising to my feet again <e> <s> my comments will be very short <e> <s> the house and the committee will always respect the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby my noble friend but noble lords will not necessarily follow his views <e> <s> i rise immediately to say this <e> <s> first he is quite right if one looks at this problem comprehensively there are matters of administration of powers over banks of secrecy of banks and so on that have to be considered <e> <s> my anxiety standing here dealing with a private members bill and therefore merely expressing my own opinion <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is in the habit of not listening to what he does not wish to hear <e> <s> therefore he has of course the liberty of not listening to me

the moment <e> <s> i say that advisedly because certain members now present in the house may not have been present last time <e> <s> i should like to deal a little with the history after first saying that it is a privilege to have my words quoted by the noble and learned lord lord denning i have spent most of my legal career quoting him and this is the first time that he has ever quoted me <e>",

or hijacking that countrys airlines will not be permitted to land in the countries which have observed this convention and that if there is to be no landing at our or those countries airports in

covering a wider area and therefore we should not introduce the provision into a narrower area <e> <s> if we went on like that we should never have any reforms at all <e> <s> if it were deemed sensible to set up a commissioner with those powers and duties now under this bill i have no doubt that having done that he would then be available to deal with the larger area so properly suggested

deal with the question i put to him <e> <s> i am afraid i am left in a state of mental limbo <e> <s> i am in that state not only because of what the noble viscount has said but also because of what the noble and learned lord lord denning has said <e> <s> the noble and learned lord knows i put this to him with the utmost respect and diffidence <e> <s> i thought he commenced his speech by saying

follow the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only so that the house can have a full argument <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that first we have never had before the case of any resident who could week after week if he wanted to keep watch for the first time because a resident in a neighbourhood can do this and say i think these people are a

were dealing with kerb crawling <e> <s> that is why i brought out the motor vehicle in my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please give way so that we do not lose this point again in confusion <e> <s> is he really saying that this is the way that an undertaking from a minister is carried out that a debate on whether persistence should be a necessary ingredient should be left to

passage of this bill alone would not cure the problem and that hereafter we should go further into the question of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that a labour government was not in power

his remarks <e> <s> i should have liked to have moved them but i think that what he has said precludes me from doing so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene merely to ask whether the minister

him to assure us that the matter will be considered <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could perhaps finally press the minister without in any way embarrassing him <e> <s> may i first of all rather resent

emergency ought to be covered <e> <s> i can make a suggestion to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> can we be assured that there will be guidelines issued to the police so that when enforcing this clause a constable will on all possible occasions get the concurrence of a more senior police officer before he carries out the provisions of clause it being well understood that if that is not

all quarters of your lordships house <e> <s> the first is to express sympathy for the victims of these disorders whether they be police or whether they be civilians <e> <s> the second is to condemn as i do in a forthright unequivocal manner from this front bench murder violence arson riot and looting <e> <s> the third thing is general support for the police and other services in their unenviable task in facing an unwelcome new chapter in the history of our inner city areas <e>", "<cs> my lords only for the purpose of the record i am sure the noble lord will readily <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly rise to add to the observations of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> in fact i was the one who raised the matter by an amendment when many members of your lordships house were present <e> <s> i regret if the noble and learned lord lord denning was not there but it will be found in the record of the proceedings <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said that in principle he agreed with the idea that the matter would be further considered and that suitable amendments would be made to the bill <e> <s> your lordships house had this matter before it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want further to complicate the minuet <e> <s> all i wanted to do was to add to the tune by saying thank you very much to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i now enter the completely peaceful arena and merely say that i did raise this matter in your lordships house at the instance of the law society <e> <s> the noble and learned lord in his courtesy said what he has repeated to your lordships and i can say this to your lordships and i hope it will completely satisfy the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord renton that in all my discussions with the law society there was not the slightest doubt but that unlimited liability would be the ground upon which registration would be authorised that limited liability at no time would be countenanced <e> <s> your lordships will see that anybody who pretends to be a licensed incorporated body will under these amendments in fact commit a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords as the one who had the privilege of moving this amendment which had the full support of the law society i want to express my personal gratitude as my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones has been kind enough to do on my behalf to the noble and learned lord for the fact that his thoughts and decision obviously counted with another place in seeing that the commons amendment is now before your lordships <e> <s> as my <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow if i may upon a great judge a parliamentarian of great repute sitting as he does as a former minister on the government side and a somewhat courageous back-bencher in the form of the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> i do so because in my view there is no party consideration in what we are now discussing <e> <s> it is a question of the dignity the pride and the tradition of this house <e> <s> as rightly stated by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter we have our great tradition in the role of the revising chamber <e> <s> i go this far speaking completely non-politically <e> <s> the procedure that we are asked to adopt today is an insult to this chamber <e> <s> it is an insult too to people who are meant to practise in insolvency law whether they be lawyers or whether they be accountants <e> <s> both professions welcome many of the principles of the bill <e> <s> but they are being asked to deal with a bill that will not have had a proper amount of attention in your lordships house in relation to a number of amendments <e> <s> there are government amendments to commons amendments filling up many pages <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening before he passes to another point <e> <s> he made the specific statement that there would be no amending bill during the next session <e> <s> can he make it clear that it is not the governments intention to have an amending bill before this bill comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can help me <e> <s> it is very important that we get this right and it is a rather complex matter because of the supplementary list <e> <s> may i respectfully suggest that the house do adjourn for a couple of minutes in order that we can get this procedurally right rather than make an error at this last stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a temperate moderate and human debate on a human problem <e> <s> i think we are all grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for that opportunity as the result of his initiative <e> <s> he uttered a rather pessimistic statement in the course of his interesting and informative speech <e> <s> he said that he realised that there was little hope of his motion being accepted and of the government changing their attitude <e> <s> from this dispatch box i refuse to adopt such a pessimistic view <e> <s> we have a new secretary of state <e> <s> in saying that i in no way cast aspersions on his predecessor <e> <s> we also have an understanding minister dealing with home affairs in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister continues he is now on a matter that i believe exercises the consciences and minds of everyone who has participated in the debate and those listening to it <e> <s> what i was asking for and what i think others who have participated in the debate were asking for is a direct instruction from the home office to immigration officials as to the way in which they would deal with these tests in regard to primary purpose and the merciful way and understanding way in which they were to be asked to deal with them <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister at least say that he will give consideration to that matter and discuss it with his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the noble lord the minister i hope for the last time <e> <s> i have not said that if a case comes to the secretary of state he will not deal with it compassionately <e> <s> that was not my remark <e> <s> i take it for granted that he would <e> <s> i am sure that if it came to the noble lord the minister he would show equal compassion <e> <s> i am dealing with instructions <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall make an appeal to the minister following on what my noble friend lord bruce of donington has just said <e> <s> i do not want to repeat anything that my noble friend has said <e> <s> that would be a waste of the time of the house <e> <s> i want to make a fresh point arising out of what he has

will forgive me if i say that he comes into the first category in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may immediately thank the noble lord the minister for his courtesy in the way in which he referred to amendment a which now appears before the house <e> <s> i shall not use this analogy again i promise for the house will get fed up with it but in his repertoire <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to keep the house at this hour by further argument but i do want to make a plea to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he realises that he is dealing with respresentations made by a very responsible body who have taken a very leading part in the discussions on this bill and who have been indulging in very helpful conversations with the noble lords department which has very often availed itself of the advice tendered by the law society <e>", "<cs> my lords if two lawyers give a different opinion their aim is a common aim and usually a compromise is reached <e> <s> i regret that the noble lord the minister has presumably been advised not to accept a compromise which obviously affects the very intention that he has expressed <e> <s> i hope that the ministers department and i say this with very great respect will not come to regret as the result of a judicial statement at some future time that at twenty-two minutes to eleven at night the minister was not able to accommodate the law society on this amendment <e> <s> i hope that situation does not arise <e> <s> if it does i hope that the noble lords memory will reflect the discussion that has taken place on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seek to withdraw it but i have no alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving amendment no <e> <s> za with the permission of the house i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> zb and zc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord bruce of donington for the way in which he has supported this amendment <e> <s> again i hope that the minister would not have cause to regret the fact that this amendment was not accepted because of of the doubts that will be cast in the future on the interpretation of this section <e> <s> however i have no alternative in all the circumstances bearing in mind the stage we have reached and the ministers response but to ask the leave of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise three points with the noble lord the minister on the important statement that he repeated <e> <s> if i may respectfully say so is not the answer to some of the observations made by the noble lord lord wigoder that the government which have so properly ordered this inquiry have not done so because there were acquittals <e> <s> they have done so because there were accusations of improper methods being used in a vital series of investigations with a jury finding presumably as a matter of fact that those statements had been improperly obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords will the house assume that all of us are most sympathetic with the noble lord the minister who has taken over the responsibility for repeating this statement and answering questions in the absence of the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> and may i say that with his usual frankness he has done all he can to answer the questions <e> <s> having said that because the question i asked is very important would the noble lord look at the wording of the statement which says not only that <e>", "<cs> my lords for the very last time i promise the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said already my noble friend lady ewart-biggs deserves the thanks not only of members of this house who have stayed for this important debate but in my view of the country at large which is indebted to her for having initiated it <e>

so the utmost consideration in regard to this important matter <e> <s> a voice of mercy has been heard in the house at the same time a voice of realism <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble lord the minister will forgive me <e> <s> i shall not interrupt him again i promise unless i have to <e> <s> i was talking in terms about licensing from prisons not licensing from the courts <e> <s> in other words the licensing on parole could in fact be done by a home office order giving that leave to the prison authorities and giving that direction to them <e> <s> that is what i was inquiring about <e>", "<cs> my lords if the experiment is tried will british telecom make sure that it gets the numbers right <e>", "<cs> my lords after thanking the noble lord the minister for a lucid speech in which he included some self-comforting and very selective references to the procedure of your lordships house perhaps i may make a few preliminary comments <e> <s> the first is that i should like to join with the noble lord the minister in saying how glad we are that my noble friend lord mellish with his extensive parliamentary career and very long and distinguished public life will <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount will forgive my interruption which is not to conduct an argument i promise him <e> <s> but merely to explain what i was trying to say <e> <s> in at least one conservative manifesto but possibly two credit has been taken for the reduction in crime as a result of their policy <e> <s> i was merely saying what the present figures are and how false unfortunately that forecast appears to have been <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord prepared for his department to impress upon the police authorities that the public is very concerned at a number of huge fraud cases not least that of lloyds which was recently reported which appear to be taking place without any prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may revert to the original question is it not also fair to say that the monopolies and mergers commission while pointing out anti-competition practices in various instances decided that those practices were not contrary to the public interest <e>

will be reporting <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount kindly speak for himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend if i may call him such lord walston when he says what a pleasant debate this has been <e> <s> it has been pleasant for a number of reasons <e> <s> first because there has been unanimity throughout your lordships house in regard to the courage with which this bill has been brought forward and agreement with its main principles <e> <s> it has been pleasant too because we have been congratulating each other <e> <s> rightly was the noble lord lord glenarthur paid the compliment of having introduced this bill with great clarity and of being the first minister for over years to bring in the bill for this measure by addressing your <e>", "<cs> my lords that makes it even worse from my point of view and makes the name that i tried to put before your lordships even more favourable if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord passes on will he deal with domestic cosmetics <e> <s> that was what those of us who raised the subject were talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may commence my i hope appropriate remarks following upon as is my privilege the notable speech of the right reverend prelate loving they neighbour as thyself dictates that with speakers on the list we should keep to brief and concise speeches <e> <s> i shall endeavour to do so <e> <s> and may i make it clear immediately that i speak for myself from this dispatch box and for myself alone <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am most indebted to the noble lord lord sainsbury who speaks with such authority on these matters <e> <s> i alter my sentence and in fact i make it stronger if i may say so <e> <s> we certainly are not faced by any overwhelming demand from the retailers <e> <s> we are not even faced by a demand at all because they have decided that they cannot make up their minds on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not follow my noble friend in the last remarks that he made but to return to this point and i shall conclude very shortly what is the matter then that the house has to decide <e> <s> this is a better house than any i would submit for a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very gracious to give way but he issued a challenge <e> <s> it is no fundamental part of the constitution of your lordships house or of another place that whips are issued <e> <s> they are issued usually as matter of tradition as i undersand it when matters which are political <e>", "<cs> my lords having a nearer family relationship with moses i must tell the noble lord that his forecast in my view is quite inaccurate <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the fact that this matter will be surveyed by the crown prosecution service when it is established in <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the very serious tasks one of which is the task to which he has referred which will fall to the lot of that service <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that that service is most unhappy about the terms and conditions being offered by the government which may result in a calibre of service which will be unable to carry out a survey of the kind which he would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that we all sympathise with him in his answer to the last question <e> <s> does he not think that at least an appreciable number of the incidents of rape have something to do with the advertisement of violence which all of us deplore <e> <s> is he not grateful as many of us are that the guidelines of the bbc in regard to violence are now being reviewed and is it not about time that that was so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the most reverend primate will forgive me if only so that we who are trying to come to a judgment on this matter may learn from his remarks <e> <s> he said that what was to be done was to protect generally but in a particular case namely where the step-parent and

bill says <e> <s> because it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords first i join with those who congratulated the noble lord lord meston on the way in which he presented his bill to your lordships house <e>

cause <e> <s> indeed i should like to pay tribute also to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran who also attempted to deal with this very troublesome matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before i receive a reproof from the noble and learned lord for not telling your lordships what i think ought to be done he might have ascertained whether or not i proposed to do that in the closing remarks of my speech <e> <s> if he had asked me i would have told him that i was attempting to do so before he intervened <e> <s> however i am grateful to him for now telling me that what i am about to say is what he wanted me to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness may be under a misapprehension but if it is i who am under the misapprehension then i ask her to correct me <e> <s> i understand that sir george baker to whose eminence in this field i willingly testify was considering this matter going to the family division of the high court <e> <s> i stand to be corrected but i do not believe that he was thinking in terms of the family court which does not now exist where we hope there will be an informal procedure which is not quite that of the procedure in the family division <e>

procedure at the present moment when we have the private bill <e> <s> the whole procedure is at large <e> <s> there are no guidelines laid down and when they come to us we consider these bills <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me in sheer fairness if i intervene at this stage <e> <s> he is quoting from one part of the speech <e> <s> he will remember that the court which was suggested then was the magistrates court and i said that in my view it was quite wrong that that court of all courts should be selected it was very often associated with criminal work <e> <s> if he does me the courtesy however boring it may be to read my speech he will find that that was the central point that i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords the order was well laid has been well explained by the noble viscount and deserves to be approved by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware yet of figures showing improvement in regard to violence at football grounds and therefore possibly ascribable to the act <e> <s> furthermore is he concerned with the question of obtaining drink outside the premises of the football grounds and if so are the government contemplating any further legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords however gravely and distastefully all members of your lordships house may regard the offence of rape is the noble and learned lord aware that his answer that each case is to be treated on its merits is consistent with our normal acceptance of justice <e> <s> is he also aware that many of us accept with very great pleasure his assurance that in future the parole board will be given all material information with the greatest care <e>", "<cs> it is upon that point only so that we complete one argument tidily that i venture to address the house again apologising to the noble and learned lord that i was called away rather urgently at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> however i heard the purport of it and i know that he will forgive me if i make some comments on it <e> <s> because i regard it as rather important from this front bench i want to deal with the argument that has been advanced <e> <s> i am not speaking on the passing of the second reading <e> <s> i am on the point that the noble and learned lord lord simon wants to emphasise namely the question of the amendment which was defeated <e> <s> your lordships know already

discipline people upon a vote of this kind will with your lordships usual sense of independence be stoutly resisted <e>", "<cs> i am awfully sorry that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has chosen to speak at this juncture <e> <s> the right reverend prelate delivered as one would expect a most helpful speech that was respectful to the committee <e> <s> it was dealt with with his usual understanding by the minister <e> <s> to have introduced another debate right at the end of what was a very diplomatic exchange was not in my view helpful to the committee <e> <s> many of us could get up and speak about the way in which sunday might be altered altered for policemen transport and shop workers and so on <e> <s> i propose to keep silent and to deal with the matter as it was so gracefully dealt with by the right reverend prelate and by the minister <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether to be helpful i can speak at this stage because i would very much appreciate as i am sure the house

now <e> <s> i know that the committee would regret it if what the noble lord lord sandford has said were to be the case <e> <s> the noble lord has done a service to the committee by pointing out a

have rushed in a manuscript amendment which i hope will fulfil the committees wish <e> <s> my manuscript amendment is that clause shall stand as it is but be amended by the addition of these words

not inconsiderable weight behind the subsequent amendment after withdrawing the present one <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord the minister is obviously right in saying that it is a matter for the charity commissioners are not the charity commissioners in the difficulty that they have to interpret our law of charity <e> <s> is not one of the arms of the law of charity the advancement of religion and is not the word religion unfortunately not very well defined in our law as yet and ought not some thought at all events to be given to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for coming back to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> we are not on the subject of desirability or undesirability <e> <s> as i understand it we are on the subject of status as a charity <e> <s> is not the difficulty here the looseness of the definition to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister feel that in many ways it might be helpful if <e>", "<cs> it is a happy custom of this house that members treat each other with courtesy and refer in very respectful terms to the nature of speeches which have been made <e> <s> it is not in that spirit alone but in one of sincerity too that i follow the noble lord lord broxbourne and admire him as usual for the clarity of his thoughts and the way in which he expresses them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has allowed me to

to whether or not a prosecution is to be brought fairly soon <e> <s> the evidence in this case must be of the simplest kind and i am asking my question from these benches out of consideration for the

"<cs> my lords i am sure we are all indebted to the noble viscount the minister for the felicitious way in which he described the terms of this order <e> <s> there was a schedule paragraph of the act

be defined as light refreshments <e> <s> looking at the order i saw as did the noble viscount the minister biscuits not including cakes <e> <s> he has explained the reason for the difference <e> <s> i

noble lord presents it we always want to listen to it and see what force there is in it the part that was the shambles that he was referring to is the principle of closing on sunday and deregulation <e> <s> we are dealing now with labour provisions <e> <s> could he kindly tell the committee if he wishes us to take his speech as seriously as i am sure he would what was a shambles about the labour provisions in the shops act and specifically what was the shambles in this section <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point which is so important and which the noble earl lord stockton has so rightly brought to our attention will be please deal with this matter <e> <s> everybody has said that the shopworker is the worker who unfortunately is least protected by trade unions <e> <s> therefore is it not proper that we protect those workers by primary legislation because to a large extent there is nobody who can negotiate for them <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the noble lords embarrassment after the very eloquent and telling intervention which brought back old memories <e>", "<cs> before the question is put i wonder whether the noble lord the minister bearing in mind that the report stage is on th february could communicate any concessions that he finds it possible to make before that date so that one knows intelligently how one should put down amendments at report stage and save the time of the house <e>", "<cs> there is no difference between the noble lord the minister and myself on this point <e> <s> i was merely hoping that we could as it were make the wheels move a little easier if the noble lord the minister indicated his intentions <e> <s> then we would know where we stood at report stage <e> <s> that is all i said <e>", "<cs> your lordships will have noticed the anxiety that i have in supporting everything that the noble lord lord renton has said and to do so officially from these benches <e> <s> he has advanced so many reasons so well that i do not intend to make a repetitive speech <e> <s> it is far better to leave it with what the noble lord said <e> <s> i am sure that when we listen to the noble lord lord wolfson whom i am so glad to hear is supporting this amendment we shall find possibly that the hours from seven oclock this evening until half past ten tonight will be known in your lordships house as in search of the thing <e> <s> at last we have found it <e>", "<cs> i too do not wish to be critical of the way in which the noble lord the minister is handling this bill <e> <s> i think we are all very content with it <e> <s> we should simply have loved a little surrender to the voice of reason now and again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord seems to take great delight in putting me in a position of intense embarrassment <e> <s> may i say that he has succeeded <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may put a point of view to your lordships and a plea that there should be an objective look at the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and supported in various parts of the house <e> <s> i believe that the house will have been touched by the speech made by the noble baroness lady ryder whom we hear all too infrequently but whose life for the benefit of this nation in that way i should also associate her gallant husband has been of terrific worth to all of us <e> <s> when she speaks we listen to her with great respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble earl on being so gainfully and usefully employed <e> <s> without any doubt without the opinion of the nation being known but with all of us realising that there are these apprehensions and different points of view we are trying to do what is right <e> <s> nobody in this chamber and i include the noble lord the minister can say anything more than i do not think family life will be interfered with i do not think people will be prevented from going to church if they want to i do not think that neighbourhoods will be interfered with i do not think people will be thrust into employment on sunday who would not want to be and i do not think this change will have an adverse effect on youth <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house would permit me without thinking me discourteous to pose a question to the noble lord <e> <s> if the noble lord found in this amendment not the end of an act at the end of three years but the words that parliament could by affirmative order renew the provisions of the act if parliament so desired would he then be in favour of such a provision <e> <s> because if he was and told us so i am sure that it would strengthen us in having a certain amendment at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise feeling almost a peace-giver to the house <e> <s> i continue i promise your lordships not at any greater length than i have spoken already to add to the argument that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has been kind enough to discuss with me and with the house <e> <s> your lordships heard from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that he was apparently so positively certain of the advantages and the outcomes of this bill that he would not even want to have an order at the end of three years to continue its provision <e> <s> it does not show to me very much faith that his views would equally be the views of parliament because if he had that confidence he would have said something rather different from what he did say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord will forgive me for intervening but as a practising member of the faith he is now describing may i say that the sabbath day is in accordance with the commandments <e> <s> it is on the seventh day and it is on saturday <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave way to the noble lord lord grimond <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house knows that i have a very deep respect for the noble lord lord sandford and for the noble and learned lord lord simon but i would respectfully remind them of an advice that was once given to me by a great advocate <e> <s> he said if ever you mock or you laugh at your opponents in court or if ever you over-exaggerate in your language in condemnation of your opponents case it is a sure sign to the judge that you have a very weak case indeed <e> <s> i did not enjoy and i noticed that the front bench did so the comments that were made about this amendment in a rather mocking tone if i may say so by the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> everybody is entitled to his opinion <e> <s> they may have reacted differently from the way i did <e>", "<cs> my lords if i return to the same sentiment that i was trying to express i use the words largely agnostic at the request of the noble lord and he rightly requests it instead of the quotation that i gave <e> <s> the sentiment is the same <e> <s> a fat lot of good it has done us by being largely agnostic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad that the noble and learned lord is being so moderate in his criticism <e> <s> but he then went on to say that this amendment would produce a situation where local authorities could decide whether or not there should be any shops open in their areas <e> <s> that is what he said and i notice that he does not correct me <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will forgive me that was the worst argument in the debate on this amendment because if he turns to the amendment itself he will see that there are principles laid down upon which a local authority have to make a decision <e> <s> they have to take into consideration various matters before they consent to an application or refuse it <e> <s> if they merely issued a blanket edict that no shops were to open in their area it would not take long on judicial review for that local authority to be castigated at once <e> <s> the noble and learned lord knows that and therefore with respect he should not as a distinguished lawyer have used that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the noble viscount who asked this question a most pleasing sense of humour to suggest that british summer time be commenced at the end of the present month <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once how much i enjoyed the short speech of the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> there is only one way in which anybody when winding up a debate at this hour certainly on this side of the house can achieve any sort of affection from his colleagues and that is if he makes his winding-up speech comparatively short <e> <s> let me admit right away that i too intended to quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so delighted that i gave way to such a thoughtful and excellent speech <e> <s> as your lordships will gather from that definition of the speech i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i could not understand the noble lord lord campbell of <e>", "<cs> my lords may the house have a period of two years moratorium to consider what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords i always want to extend the utmost courtesy to the minister as would the rest of the house but this is report stage <e> <s> does the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i must protest <e> <s> the orderliness of this house at report stage and it is not for me to bring the house to order is that when somebody moves an amendment then replies to the debate and moves the amendment finally and says that he wants to test the opinion of the house the debate then closes <e> <s> for somebody to take advantage of the opportunity even as courteously as the noble lord the minister does to start answering the debate all over again will produce only confusion and turmoil and upset the procedure of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the matter was as simple as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has made it in very lucid language <e> <s> we have been told that this is not just a sunday trading bill it is an extension of hours bill and one in which the opportunity is being taken to bring up to date old regulations under the shops acts relating to terms and conditions of employment <e> <s> we have been told it is a bill where we are envisaging a different situation industrially in from that which obtained in and was looked at even before as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale loves to remind us by a previous gower commission which decided then that the laws were out of date <e> <s> so we have done an awful lot about terms and conditions <e> <s> that is the first answer <e>", "<cs> my lords because if they have not got the power to do so and they are deprived of the power by later legislation not yet before us we are as it were as i have said caught between two fires <e> <s> i hope the opposition when it is trying to protect with the help of others sitting on benches very near to us the right of shopworkers will not be told please just wait until the wages bill <e> <s> it will then be too late <e> <s> i hope we shall not be told not to move amendments because they are irrelevant when we endeavour to give the wages council powers which they otherwise would not have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord the minister is right <e> <s> all that i would add is that we now have only one further stage of the bill at which amendments can be put forward <e> <s> that is the third reading <e> <s> it must therefore be the understanding i would have thought between all parties that the view of the government following upon the passing of the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning will be made known to those who are particularly interested in the question of terms and conditions of service at a very early date so that a decision can properly be taken as to what action should be adopted at third reading on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house there is one option which i do not know whether the house wishes to consider <e> <s> it is whether there should be a meal break in view of the progress that has been made together with the fact that we are considering the effect of an amendment the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord denning that has been passed <e> <s> whether the government front bench would approve of the idea of our continuing so that we finish at a civilised hour for a change is a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope indeed that this can be a short debate because a principle is involved <e> <s> i want to add only a couple of sentences on that principle <e> <s> we have been told that this bill is to set the people free <e> <s> we have been told repeatedly that nobody need trade on sunday unless he wants to <e> <s> we have been told that no customer need enter a shop unless he wishes to do so <e> <s> let the government realise that in regard to shopworkers who were not shopworkers at the date of the act what they are saying is that in many cases they will have to work on sunday if they want to get the job <e> <s> that is something which does not set the people free <e> <s> that does not give the element of consent that we have been told is the principle behind this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may raise a point which arises out of the principle which was just explored but which i believe rather takes me to a slightly different point <e> <s> if the noble lord the minister cannot answer the question that i put to him now i shall quite understand but i should appreciate it if he could write to me with an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for the way in which he dealt with the order now before us <e> <s> i imagine that there are three matters on which your lordships will all be in agreement in whichever seat your lordships happen to sit <e> <s> the first is that terrorism is the complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> i interrupt him only for clarification <e> <s> i saw the figure in that report but equally i saw above it and it may well be a misprint that two such exclusion orders were made in <e> <s> if one looks at the statistics there is a nil and i therefore wonder whether the figure of two is a mistake or the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me probably i could answer for myself in view of the representative capacity that i suppose i have in speaking from the dispatch box <e> <s> i expressed certain criticisms <e> <s> i supported some recommendations of sir cyril <e> <s> therefore the speech of the noble lord and that of my noble friend lord monkswell are not the only speeches in criticism of the act <e> <s> i explained to your lordships in terms that i think were clearly understood the recommendation that i would make to my noble friends if there were a vote on this matter <e> <s> i made my position abundantly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords with some indignation may i say that it is only a sign i hope of the fact that i had read the report that i got up myself and made the point <e> <s> therefore i do not intend to allow the noble lord lord wigoder to take any credit for it at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord the minister without wishing to detain the house will he at least give an assurance that the point will be considered very carefully and that possibly a question can be put down later <e> <s> this is a recommendation by sir cyril who would not have made it lightly and of course the position of those excluded people is rather different from that of those who are refused immigration and who are asked to leave our shores <e> <s> some of them may of course be british subjects who have not resided for three years as is statutorily required <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an idea that i shall not be the only person who wishes to address the house on the motion that this bill do now pass <e> <s> it is the last opportunity in this distinguished house for those of us who have very deep feelings about this bill to express them <e> <s> it is also our last opportunity to make a plea to her majestys government to think again when this bill reaches another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble lord the minister for his courtesy in rescuing me from a technical point <e> <s> possibly technical points are raised only when there is a fear of the argument which is being pursued <e> <s> i was going to say and i now know that i was saying it correctly that a conservative member of parliament mr crouch has told the press and has written a letter to the effect that he went down to a meeting in canterbury attended by people in the audience in order to defend the bill and its provisions <e> <s> he wrote to the press with a frankness that one would expect of him to say that there was not one single member of that audience who supported him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have too much of a regard for the noble and learned lord lord simon and his distinguished past to carry on any debate with him upon this matter and i believe that your lordships may feel the same <e> <s> far from indulging in any criticism of the honourable member i was praising his frankness and merely bringing to your lordships attention what he had said <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking from these benches the noble lord lord harris for introducing this important subject i would say as i believe has been implied in this debate that if the nation at this moment were asked what were the main issues worrying it the reply would come from a very large majority the unacceptable limits now to be endured of unemployment and the unacceptable limits presumably now to be endured of the increase in serious crime <e> <s> if parents were asked to state their main worry these days in regard to their children i should have said the answer would be the temptation of narcotics <e> <s> we are dealing with a matter which is very important for the nation as a whole even though this debate is limited to our capital city <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the main difficulty that the public is not only confused but is in some ways being misled in regard to civil defence measures and those measures which are covered by this very intelligent question such as one would expect from the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords to return for a moment only to one question can the noble lord inform the house whether there is any grant available for the type of service that the noble lord lord renton was referring to namely covering volunteer services in the event of an accident or emergency happening in peacetime <e>", "<cs> my lords for one entrancing moment i thought that i was due to speak on the subject of frontiers without television <e> <s> however i find that the subject matter of our discussion is just as fascinating <e> <s> at this moment i would love to pay a tribute that i believe all sides of this house would want to pay to the noble viscount lord torrington for having chaired a very able committee <e> <s> we thank and congratulate him <e> <s> like him i am sure that we shall listen with great anticipation to the maiden speaker in this debate <e> <s> i may say to the noble viscount lord chilston that we know that when he speaks we will be hearing from someone with great experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl will forgive me if i intervene merely to say and the noble viscount will speak for himself that i did not say that eventually what was suggested in the green paper would commend itself to your lordships house <e> <s> i merely said certainly not now and by all means let us look at this in stages <e>", "<cs> my lords this house is dealing not for the first time with one of the greatest curses of our generation <e> <s> i could not have put in better words a description of what we are dealing with than did the noble lord the minister in his peroration just now <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords i move on to the actual provisions of the bill with the general principles of which i believe there is unanimity in this house <e> <s> if i may and i do it quite humbly i shall merely sound a word of warning not in regard to the very special powers taken in this bill but against them being carelessly used as a precedent <e> <s> i say that for good reason <e> <s> in my judgment this bill properly does not shift the burden of proof in regard to guilt or innocence but once guilt is proved it shifts the onus to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls for pointing out to me that i may not have been entirely clear in the message that i was trying to give to the house <e> <s> this message was that the secretary of state in presenting this bill in another place talked in terms of the possible generalising in our criminal law of the particular penalty and shift of onus which are incorporated in this bill <e> <s> i was saying that i give it the fullest support in this bill for drugs traffickers but i am wary about copying that precedent in other criminal cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> it just shows what my scribble is like i read substantially having scribbled down significantly <e> <s> the word significantly does not occur in the bill <e> <s> i mention this because again it was a point mentioned in the other place by i believe someone on the government benches who said how dreadful it would be if a drug trafficker thinking that he was likely to be caught or wanting to get out of the kingdom as fast as he could told an estate agent to sell his house as quickly as possible for whatever price even if it were below the market value and someone in good faith immediately purchased the house for that figure <e> <s> it appears that in those circumstances confiscation should take place without there being any provision at all for compensation for the innocent third party <e>", "<cs> one hopes not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister if only in order to make my position abundantly clear will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i emphasised the points about the onus in regard to innocence or guilt <e> <s> i said that this did not apply obviously <e> <s> i also said that i was in favour of the provision in this bill for the change of onus on penalties <e> <s> i merely sounded a warning note having regard to his right honourable friends comments in the other place on second reading that this is not to be deemed a precedent <e> <s> we have regarded this as a very exceptional case and rightly so <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that we owe a great debt in this kingdom to the canine inhabitants <e> <s> will the noble viscount the minister tell the house how many of the numbers he so interestingly gave us are in fact specialised in drugs <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl has decided not to press his amendment today and one knows that he is an experienced and very wise person when moving amendments obviously i would not wish to quarrel with that <e> <s> but i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will appreciate that this is a series of amendments which are taken very seriously on various sides of the committee <e> <s> they are certainly amendments that are taken very seriously by the legal profession of which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is himself a worthy and respected representative <e>", "<cs> as we are dealing with a statute i wonder whether we can have the guidance of the noble and learned lord himself in regard to a clause which deals with guidance <e> <s> first what would be the position in law if having received guidance in regard to as the noble and learned lord said matters of administration matters of expenditure and matters of staff the board did not accept that guidance <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord saying that within the words of this statute it is perfectly open to the board not to accept the guidance <e> <s> in which case the words are rather misleading but naturally one would accept what the noble and learned lord has to say and try to deal with the matter at report stage <e> <s> alternatively is the noble and learned lord saying no if on matters that do not deal with the consideration or disposal of applications the secretary of state gives guidance then the board must accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone in your lordships house will want to join in the expression of horror at the spate of cases of the kind raised in this question and we all want to try to help <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord the minister will consider a suggestion which i realise however contains difficulties <e> <s> is not one of the disincentives for a complainant to come forward to the police and to court proceedings the prospect of giving evidence and being cross-examined before the public and the press <e> <s> would the minister consider the suggestion i make it no more than that that when the complainant in an appropriate case is giving evidence the court should be given discretion to clear the court of the press and the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the law commission has been very useful as one would expect it to be in regard to matters affecting property law and land registration <e> <s> indeed between the years and it produced four excellent working papers and now we are considering the second reading of a bill which emanates from a report of the law commission which was printed in the commons in october <e> <s> i mention that because the noble and learned lord has often pointed out to the house so correctly that to get a slot into the programme of legislation for recommendations of the law commission is not an easy matter <e> <s> it has taken some two and a half years for that slot to be achieved and from these benches i should like to congratulate the noble and learned lord on having achieved it even at this date <e> <s> i also believe that your lordships would want to thank the law commission for the useful work that it has done which has produced undoubtedly a very useful bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord not agree that the provisions and indeed the enforceability of the official secrets act constitute a nonsense and make fools of us all except of course for her majestys opposition <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord not agree that his reference to the previous attempt to revise this act while being perfectly correct ought to lead to an official consultation between the leaders of the various parties to see what can be done about agreement in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like only to ask a short question of the noble and learned lord and it is meant to be practical <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord consider having regard to the scandal really of the present position of this act a proper legal consultation with the leaders of the various parties possibly in both houses to see whether an agreed reformation of the act cannot take place <e>", "<cs> it seems a most sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> the same observation applies as applied to the previous amendment <e> <s> this is a very sensible series of amendments <e>", "<cs> i would want to react graciously to anything that the noble lord the minister said in regard to a bill for which as everybody knows there is wholehearted support in every quarter of the committee but i must confess that i do not understand his argument <e> <s> if it is my fault i shall apologise to him <e>", "<cs> as i have said it is the wish of all parts of the committee to be co-operative in regard to this bill <e> <s> the noble lord the minister says that without any commitment as he emphasises he is prepared to consider the submissions that have been made <e> <s> will he take it for granted from me and obviously this became apparent from the discussions that have taken place that if he came forward with an amendment that allowed for the discretion of the court <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> it has been said previously and i think with very good reason that the duty of parliament in this dreadful era of drug trafficking is a heavy one <e> <s> it has a duty to protect the public and to pursue the ringleaders of this iniquitous trade <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> i have never known the noble and learned lord in such a receptive mood <e> <s> he is prepared to accept almost anything in order to get this amendment through and i admire him for that <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord the minister be kind enough to add to his points of consideration the two that i ventured to make about the reasonable grounds for suspicion and the rank of the officer concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend the secretary of state for home affairs in another place it really is my duty to say from these benches that this discloses a most scandalous state of affairs <e> <s> i

taken to see that everything was in order in regard to this application for extradition <e> <s> in saying that i realise that we are all human and human error can occur in the best-regulated circles

him again <e> <s> i asked the minister a very relevant question namely for this house to be informed of the errors in the first set of warrants <e> <s> i told the minister what i had been informed and

and frank answer <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is frank with the house but i absolutely decry the lack of information which has been given to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i have asked the following question what is the nature of the technicalities in the first set of errors which occurred with the warrants <e> <s> for example do they include a misspelling of the defendants name <e>", "<cs> my lords to abbreviate this matter will the noble lord be good enough to have a list of the technicalities complained of in regard to the october warrants presented in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> why not my lords <e>", "<cs> when we were considering an earlier amendment i ventured to say to your lordships that every conceivable assistance ought to be given within the circumference of acceptable legal propositions to catch the big dealers and this chamber and one hopes another place will indeed sanction them <e> <s> that was the background against which i ventured to approach from these benches amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment referred to a voluntary scheme which dealt with banks and financial institutions which were permitted to escape from the normal consequences of breach of contract and confidentiality if they endeavoured to assist the authorities <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord denning has fairly said this is a very different proposition <e> <s> this is mandatory and when looking at something mandatory upon the banks to disclose confidential information i beg the committee to realise what is being done <e>", "<cs> i immediately rise to give my wholehearted support to this amendment and to the extension mentioned by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i have received a letter as i believe the minister has from the retail consortium and it is very worthy of that organisation saying that it wholeheartedly supports the amendment and feels that the ingredient of <e>", "<cs> may i put just a brief question <e> <s>

confiscation order and to serve a term of imprisonment in default <e> <s> one of the matters raised on second reading i remember was that there are many people who would prefer a term of imprisonment and come out with their ill-gotten gains in their millions <e> <s> one wonders therefore whether the confiscation order should not be an order made by the court without any alternative being given to the defendant <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that prevention of unnecessary cruelty to animals by way of experimentation would be the wish of the majority of the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that we in this country have a close association with the members of the ethiopian royal family <e> <s> was not the emperor a guest of this country for some years

lord proceeds to that matter i wonder whether he will forgive me if i point out that the law society certainly others will speak for the bar is most unhappy about the suggestions in this clause in regard to charges <e> <s> will he please make clear one thing if he can <e> <s> is it intended that for the work done which is legally aided work and the work done by solicitors for private clients the taxing masters and registrars will be enabled to assess the costs on precisely the same basis or will different principles apply <e> <s> will this mean that the legally aided solicitor will get less <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to interrupt the noble and learned lord again and i promise that it is the last time <e> <s> has he read an article in the <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords he has already described it <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing this interesting and topical motion the noble baroness lady faithfull delivered what she called a grass-hopping speech <e> <s> indeed she hopped with her usual graciousness from point to point as sometimes if i may be allowed to say so was the case with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in areas not strictly covered by the motion before the house <e> <s> i want to restrict myself in the remarks i have to make on this topical subject to the increase in violent crime what is the size of it what are we to do about it and what if anything can we do in order to assist the victims of violent crime <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will forgive me for intervening but the point i made was a comparison with the percentage of registered drug addicts concerned in ordinary crime which was three times that of the general population whereas in regard to crimes of violence it was less <e> <s> there seems to be something to be deduced from that statistic though i take the noble baronesss point <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will forgive me is there any doubt throughout the united kingdom whatever the state of our citizenship whatever our multiracial content that crime is wrong <e> <s> who has to say this and to whom <e>", "<cs> in your favour <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord lord broxbourne was right when he said that there are arguments for and against any period of limitation or any long stop period that one cares to choose <e> <s> i join with him in thanking the noble lord

this a better bill <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean that we must agree with the noble lords efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend wishes me to use the words less unclarity i shall

overboard the deliberations of four years of a pretty high ranking committee <e> <s> if we are to get this bill through and one hopes that this is not deferred till the third reading then let us try to make up our minds and i suggest that we support that committee on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for that intervention <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord broxbourne will be the first to agree with me when i say that they of all our judges have the best experience of building cases and if this is the view that they have taken then i say so be it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord howie has merely underlined the complexity of the definition <e>", "<cs> my lords i answer the noble lord lord hacking only by saying that the fact that there can be complexity in one act is no good reason for imposing it upon another <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from these back-benches for a reason that the house will know by virtue of the fact that i have disclosed an interest in that

learned friend lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> may i suggest in view of the fact that discussions are to take place that further questions of the nature of the last two are not very helpful <e> <s> could we therefore proceed to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister and the house forgive me for putting this question having entered the chamber a little late <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister as he has recognised already note that there is to be a debate on this very serious matter on friday week <e> <s> will he therefore take it that the fact i am not disputing some of the statements he has made does not mean that we shall not be having a very full debate on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister correctly anticipated that this would be a very welcome amendment in this house as indeed it was in another place <e> <s> one remembers the debates upon this which took place <e> <s> the noble lord has described them very accurately with the appropriate adjectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i only rise in order to pay tribute to my noble friend lord melchett for the part that he played in getting this amendment before the house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this is the appropriate time and place to mention the matter of may and shall in a little more detail <e> <s> if it is not then as usual my words will fall upon

noble lord the minister <e> <s> it was a little unfair of me because i should have given him notice of this question and i was not able to do so <e> <s> i shall be delighted if he takes up the matter

glenarthur as well as to the noble viscount lord davidson for having handled this bill with great charm and great clarity of mind <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister indicate when this legislation is likely to come before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this question a little offensive to the very worthy members of the parole board who carry out their difficult duties with great skill and great feeling but nevertheless with the proper protection of the public in mind <e> <s> is it really a question in any noble lords mind that they do not have in their consideration of a recommendation the very fact that crimes may be recommitted especially crimes of violence <e> <s> have we not proper confidence in the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords when the act came before the house as a bill and met with all-party support did we not have in mind in particular the nasties <e> <s> can the noble viscount the minister indicate to the house whether the act has been implemented to the extent that those nasties are now no longer appearing and are under control <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister very courteously wrote to me to the noble lord lord hooson and to the noble lord lord harris with a very full explanation of the basis for these amendments <e> <s> he gave us time to reflect upon them and we certainly agree with them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once that i appreciate fully the reasons for the amendments that are now before us <e> <s> it would indeed be very invidious if it were possible for a drug trafficker to make off with his proceeds by removing them north of the border and with this bill which we hope will soon become an act not enforceable over the border <e> <s> the only matter that i want to raise from the point of view of tidiness is this <e> <s> the noble and learned lord talked in terms of fresh scottish legislation coming before us <e> <s> we will then presumably have this act with part of the provisions and another act dealing with the whole of the provisions that relate to scotland <e> <s> has the noble and learned lord given any thought to the possibility that in that act the provisions of this bill will be incorporated and will be cancelled in this legislation <e> <s> otherwise we are going to have two acts which relate to scotland and the dichotomy is a little untidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendment now before us is indeed an improvement on the one that i suggested <e> <s> i readily accept it <e> <s> i am most grateful for the most gracious way it has been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords in case any noble lords should think that these technical amendments are coming before the house very late there are two points i should like to make in fairness <e> <s> first those of us who have been particularly interested in this bill have again received explanations before the amendment came before the house today which have proved most helpful <e> <s> secondly it must be borne in mind and i may be referring to this point hereafter that this bill is a real precedent in our legislation in respect of confiscation and dealing with proceeds <e> <s> therefore a heavy burden has fallen upon those who are guiding the minister <e> <s> we appreciate the reason why these technical amendments have possibly come before the house at an unusually late point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make the position of those sitting on these benches absolutely clear <e> <s> from the very start of this legislation and indeed before it we were committed to doing all that we possibly could to assist the government in dealing with this notoriously evil trade <e> <s> were it in connection with any other matter at all i should hesitate before coming to this dispatch box and saying on behalf of my noble friends that we agree to a statutory provision which is absolutely unprecedented in our criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt only to ask the noble lord whether he could make a clear statement for the record that the government understand perfectly well that this is an exceptional power in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> that is all i ask for <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very appropriate amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords these are sensible and useful amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house but it is remarkable to me that

cannot be made by anyone below the rank of superintendent <e> <s> i merely smile and sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for intervening and i do so only because

india does not know or recognise dual nationality and those people therefore lost any chance of their indian nationality <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two lessons that i want to try to learn anew in this winding-up speech <e> <s> the first is that no one who winds up a debate as i have the privilege of doing on this occasion should regard it as necessary to deal with all the arguments that have been advanced far better than he would be able to <e> <s> the second lesson is not to over-dramatise or over-emotionalise as an advocate an issue that has been taken so seriously by your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that i am not disobeying that second lesson when i say that truly this afternoon your lordships are acting as the ultimate court of appeal <e> <s> the appellants are the people within the ethnic minority in hong kong <e> <s> the respondents are the government but not the benches opposite because sympathetic speeches on this motion have been delivered from all parts of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recognise that when the government brought the drug legislation before the house it was on the basis that it was a very exceptional measure to deal with a very exceptional situation <e> <s> will the government exercise the greatest care before taking as precendents the extraordinary powers given under that legislation <e> <s> will they certainly stop short of the powers in that legislation that deal with banks enforced disclosure and protection for banks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the minister for that reply and indeed for his answer to a written question by his noble friend lord gainford which by coincidence appears in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister put this matter in the correct perspective <e> <s> is it not correct that the commissioner of the metropolitan police for whom on all sides of this house there is tremendous respect and an appreciation of the burden he bears has said with all the responsibility of his office that he needs recruits immediately in order to carry out his task <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister saying that the government know better than he does and that merely to supply per cent <e> <s> of what he has asked for this year and indeed if i may correct the noble lord lord harris getting only out of after four years means the government are then saying that they take responsibly the promises of the prime minister and their own loudly-acclaimed policy in regard to law and order <e>", "<cs> my lords i postpone my happiness with the amendment for only a moment <e> <s> i have no comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble lord the minister on his expertise in scots law which appears to equal his expertise in his own native law of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct myself and apologise and ask the noble lord whether he will not mislead the house and will really obtain a scots accent when he addresses us <e>", "<cs> my lords one always listens with the greatest possible respect and this is a phrase always used when one follows the noble and learned lord lord denning and i use it once more to anything that the noble and learned lord says to the house <e> <s> if i really believed that there was a grave inconsistency here and that the courts would have a terribly difficult task to perform which is what the noble and learned lord thought i should certainly want to consider negating this amendment <e> <s> i did not quite follow the noble and learned lord when he said that possibly the best course in spite of the inconsistency that he saw and the impossible task laid before the courts was to leave it to the courts to sort it out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister was right to stress at the end of the passage of this bill through your lordships house what was said in the introductory speeches on the bill namely that the house was dealing with one of the greatest evils with which our society has to deal <e> <s> possibly there has been an example of that only over the past hours or so whether or not that be so i know that all your lordships would wish to extend your sympathy to a bereaved family which is of significant value in public duty and in public work for this country <e>", "<cs> my lords woe to the membership of your lordships house whose duty it is to wind up a debate on an important bill at minutes past four on a friday afternoon and gallant indeed are the courteous few who have stayed to listen to the closing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the long title of the bill which deals with regulation of assemblies and so on would be able to encompass the way in which this legislation would be able to deal with how these matters could be decided <e> <s> i obviously defer to the noble lord whose authority on these matters i respect but at this time of the afternoon i merely wish to leave the matter there he registering his view and i registering mine with the optimistic hope that mine is right <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be singularly inappropriate for me of all people to make that diagnosis <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down may i rectify an omission of which i am guilty <e> <s> i was charged by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones to apologise to your lordships for his absence from the closing speeches because he had important public duties to fulfil outside london <e>", "<cs> i should be very short my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry that the noble lord the minister did not allow me to make an observation before he replied only because i believe the house might have welcomed that observation <e> <s> what i shall say will be very short <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord with his usual courtesy will allow an intervention because this is upsetting the whole rules that govern us in discussion at committee stage <e> <s> we are either discussing amendments that have been moved or by arrangement are to be spoken to or we really find ourselves in complete disarray <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has in no way been moved <e> <s> my noble friend may decide when he comes to amendment no <e> <s> either to move it or not to move it but if we start discussing amendments which by arrangement are not to be discussed and assume that they are going to be moved we really end up in chaos <e> <s> since the noble lord was anxious to avoid chaos before in his submission to the committee i am sure that he will now wish to avoid it in his own case <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion at the committee stage it was rather jovially suggested that i who had to be out of the country at the time on professional business had deliberately arranged it so in order that i might avoid the wrath of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor which was very vocally expressed at certain suggestions that were made by the law society <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the serpentine lido is not the only place where dead ducks are raised <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that when dealing with a certain type of service to which the noble lord lord young of dartington drew attention he used the word embraces <e> <s> would he care to correct the <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the grave concern that there has been in the past that difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place by his right honourable friend <e> <s> it would be singularly ungracious of us too if we did not thank the members of the peacock committee for their industry over the past months <e> <s> perhaps i may be permitted to close my eulogy with those words <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister continues is he able on behalf of the government categorically to say that the mere possession of cash therefore making possible the highest offer must not be the criterion for granting <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recollect as i believe the house will the pressure that has been applied from time to time by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs in regard to the scandalous conditions that have existed at holloway <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble lord lord swansea for his courage and his ability to take advantage of a procedure not often taken advantage of namely to challenge as he is entitled to do by way of asking for the annulment of an order that comes before us <e> <s> too many orders go through our house ones that require affirmative resolution and those that require negative resolution and they go through on the nod <e> <s> it is a correct procedure of our democratic rights that we have listened tonight to a prayer for an annulment of an order relating to firearm fees <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the report of the select committee which was mentioned by my noble friend lord mellish can the minister indicate when the entirely sub-human conditions of sanitation in our prisons will cease <e> <s> is there a target date fixed so far as the home office is concerned so that at least by that date our prisons will deserve the term civilised <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept agreement from this bench that the government lose no opportunity when appropriate to blow their own trumpet <e> <s> before the noble lord makes political points about what the labour government did will he reflect upon the terrific increase in prison occupancy since his own government took over from the labour government <e> <s> is not this huge increase responsible for the conditions that i tried to describe earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that most of us in your lordships house would prefer that innocent motorists are arrested rather than that one guilty motorist should go free if he was driving while the worse for drink <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord lord nugent of guildford accept from someone who over many years has been a director of the national theatre that in fact there is very great financial control <e> <s> would he give appreciation to the fact that two very eminent people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put my remarks in the form of a question <e> <s> would the minister agree and would the noble lord lord nugent listen that the nation has been privileged to have two directors of two great companies namely sir peter hall and trevor nunn as directors of subsidised theatres when the commercial world wanted them very badly and would have paid them very much more <e>", "<cs> my lords while sharing completely the description given by the noble baroness lady sharpies of this being a happy day i have i hope no intention of drawing your lordships attention to the period of time mentioned in this question <e> <s> does not the noble viscount the minister agree that the answers he has given about time relate to the time between an application and acceptance of the application as against the time between application and joining the force which is a very different time indeed <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that in regard to the time between application and acceptance there have been periods as short as weeks and as long as weeks and that applications vary so much that to take an average is terribly misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not rather a cracked answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that that answer in regard to compensation for the applicants is really not good enough <e> <s> is he further aware that many of these applicants are people of very limited means and organisations with very limited funds <e> <s> having misled them into doing all this work or even having decided quite honourably not to continue with community <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i am sure that with his usual courtesy he will allow me to say that he is much too modest in thinking that i have not read his judgment <e> <s> i have it here <e> <s> it was a judgment which dealt with the common law position <e> <s> in my speech i made no mention of the fact that it was not part of the common law

only so that his reply can be complete <e>", "<cs> it is covered in the third line on page <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee which i do not really need but which i think out of courtesy i ought to seek because i have jumped up again in order that the discussion is complete and as all of us are trying to help and make a sensible clause and not as i have said make a sacrifice to bureaucracy and put burdens upon citizens and the police which are inapplicable perhaps i may give another example that readily springs to mind <e> <s> it is that of the salvation army which most likely will hold its procession every sunday but not necessarily in a particular area <e> <s> it may come from another area and the fact that it happens to be a different branch of the salvation army

where it should lie and having regard to the remarks of the noble lord lord renton can the minister say whether any delay in this matter is due not to the european court of justice in any way but to

matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise questions comments and brevity <e> <s> may i first be allowed to dissociate these benches from the remarks of the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble baroness whether it is not a pity that the one house of parliament sitting at this critical time is dealing with a statement out of which only words have come while no policy statement at all has issued from her majestys government <e> <s> if one takes it for granted as we do from all sides of this house that it was right and proper with his customary dignity for the foreign secretary

reason has been shown not to prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches perhaps i may also tender my congratulations to the noble earl and wish him well <e> <s> may i also wish him as long a tenure of office as it takes to get a reply from the charity commission <e> <s> is he aware that quite apart from governmental application to the charity commission for advice humble trustees have to apply to the charity commission under the terms of the act for advice and again there are substantial delays by virtue of shortage of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may at once express <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interrupted in the middle of a non-controversial statement <e> <s> it was to thank the noble earl for his suggestion which we readily adopt on our side <e> <s> indeed i am sure he would agree that for any other procedure to be adopted and for us to attempt to take part iii today would make a mockery of the committee stage <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his suggestion <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we are not misleading ourselves a little about this point <e> <s> first there is no question of any amendment suggesting that it is ordinarily an offence for anyone to disguise his identity <e> <s> what we are dealing with is a condition which may be imposed by the police in certain circumstances where they feel it appropriate <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> it is with great pleasure that we accept the first amendment i believe that the noble earl has moved in this chamber on this bill <e>", "<cs> i always appreciate the contributions made by the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton <e> <s> but i wonder whether against the background that i seek to remind the committee exists in this part of the bill it is right to treat this amendment in the way that they did <e>", "<cs> the noble earl may by all means do so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl would consider a submission i am going to make to him one which does not apply only to this amendment <e> <s> i think many of us realise that in this country there are troublesome organisations in regard to which this legislation is possibly very necessary <e> <s> i think it would not be seemly if he will forgive my saying so to pick out organisations as though they are the ones to which we are mainly directing our attention when they have at least the benefit of great ideals sincerely held <e> <s> many of us are thinking of fascists who have disrupted neighbourhoods and terrorised people and on this side we are thinking of such organisations and demonstrations <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will forgive me but i do not think it is very useful in seeking unanimity in this committee if organisations of the kind he mentioned are singled out as being the trouble-makers to whom our attention is directed <e> <s> he singled out the anti-apartheid movement and the cnd and it did not meet with a very warm response in various parts of the committee <e>", "<cs> it is to be expected that there would be support from these benches for such a liberal amendment if i may put it that way but on reflection one has to decide either that the bills provisions are necessary to deal with assemblies which are a menace or that they are not necessary <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is indebted to the noble lord lord teviot for the careful way in which he has prepared his case in which he obviously and sincerely believes <e> <s> i intend to be very <e>", "<cs> may i make a comment for clarification <e> <s> what the noble earl has said is absolutely right and this is an agreement among all parties interested in this part of the bill <e> <s> he probably has noticed that in schedules and there are references by way of definition which i relate back to part iii <e> <s> i want to confirm for the sake of tidiness that when we reach schedules and and incorporate them into the bill because there is no point in debating them the same conditions apply as clearly apply to part iii <e>", "<cs> i believe that we start with a unanimous thought which is that there is every reason to try to grapple with what is even more than a nuisance to many farmers throughout the country and to many owners of land who are not farmers by the invasion of hippies and people of all sorts who have no right to be on that land who very often inflict the most terrible damage and who make themselves a very great nuisance indeed <e> <s> it is a point about which i should have thought the committee is unanimous <e>", "<cs> i do not want to interrupt the noble lord but he is introducing a novel procedure of moving amendments verbally in a way that i admire and envy <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl has been extremely gracious in his remarks <e> <s> the committee

question of an unpaid parking fine <e> <s> is the foreign office involved in a protest to the ambassador <e> <s> is the department of transport involved in some protest <e> <s> what procedure is adopted in order that the embassies know at a proper level how much we dislike this sort of happening <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister accept that in all parts of your lordships house this incident must be regarded with horror <e> <s> does he also accept that it would be extremely dangerous and wrong to take an unfortunate case of this kind and try to apply to it a general rule in regard to the granting of parole which is always granted and dealt with with the utmost care <e>", "<cs> my lords these arrangements are obviously very fair in all the circumstances and i thank the noble earl for having announced them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl take great comfort from the fact that the noble viscount described his reply as a very good answer <e> <s> will

minister for his courtesy in agreeing to make a statement in response to approaches made to the government yesterday by the official opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may at once express the appreciation of the house for the courtesy of the minister in repeating this statement which was made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> perhaps i may also immediately join him in expressing appreciation of the services the patience and the tolerance exercised by immigration officials and police last week at heathrow when the situation was truly dreadful <e> <s> we dealt with that in this house on friday last and i do not intend to repeat anything that i said then nor if i may be allowed to say so do i wish to withdraw anything that i said then in criticism of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the noble lord lord renton whose contributions we always welcome must not confuse the issue because it makes the conduct of the opposition in such matters somewhat confused in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the point i wanted to make which is that we have made it abundantly clear that regretfully strict <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i still think that there is a simpler way of dealing with this question but this is not the appropriate time <e> <s> that should obviously be by way of a suggested amendment either to the schedule or to later provisions of the bill <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was only forecasting <e>", "<cs> i think the minister himself was almost hesitating as he addressed the committee on this matter <e> <s> usually the waves come over between us fairly clearly <e> <s> however on this occasion i did not detect any strong resolve in his own mind that this amendment should be resisted <e>", "<cs> someone much more learned than i whispered to me as rose because that would only be an offence under an act of and this occurred in <e>", "<cs> i propose to consider what the noble earl has said <e> <s> at the moment i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a brief word to the very strong submission that was made by the noble lord lord hutchinson and others who participated in this debate <e> <s> i hope that my short point will persuade the noble earl that he must take this matter back unless he wishes to face a division <e> <s> the first part of the alleged offence is that the person who presents or directs the performance intends thereby to stir up racial hatred <e> <s> may we take it for granted that any look at this play would immediately acquit the person concerned of the charge that that is what he intended <e> <s> then may we take it for granted that there is a play at the end of which complete and absolute mockery is made of the character who stirs up the racial hatred but that it is such an awful play that three-quarters of the audience walk out at the interval <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl bear with me for a moment <e> <s> we are very short of time in the programming of this bill and the minister has been good enough to say on a number of occasions that he would look again at various amendments that have been put <e> <s> the difficulty is that with the greatest of good will so far as he is concerned looking at it will entail a response either by way of letter or by other means which may not reach those of us who have moved amendments until the closing stages of this bill <e> <s> one knows that certain rules apply to amendments at third reading <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much <e>", "<cs> it does and i am most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl will forgive me for asking this question on this important subsection because it contains an exception to the general rule <e> <s> if it got as far as being seen by the employees of the cable company concerned obviously it had not reached the transmission stage and it was racially offensive to those employees would the exception operate in his view <e> <s> it seems to me that it would <e> <s> again i am throwing this at the noble earl from one dispatch box to another which is not very fair <e> <s> it may very well be that the answer is available but if not i shall be content if he would care to write to me <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interpose with what i promise will be a few brief remarks <e> <s> if it were the general policy of parliament as advocated by the noble lord lord donaldson and very often advocated from these benches as he quite correctly <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for those courteous words <e> <s> he has explained the matter to me and i now understand things much better <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to support amendment no <e> <s> which has been so eloquently moved by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> indeed silence from these benches does not mean that we have not approved of the other amendments which he has moved including amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i want to add something <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl will follow his argument through <e> <s> he says that if you leave out the words disorderly behaviour the existing words do not cover what he has in mind which is a group of youngsters hooligans one may call them who in the early hours of the morning are banging dustbin lids <e> <s> nobody in his senses will defend such conduct <e> <s> we are dealing now with a criminal offence <e> <s> i should have thought that such an offence would be likely to cause a breach of the peace and would give rise to certain rights but i am not even going to argue that <e>", "<cs> my lords the gleam has gone out of my eye and if your lordships find a rather blank expression on my face your lordships will understand why and sympathise <e> <s> i have often heard it said that among the praises that rightly are given to civil servants there is one reservation that one makes and one does it still with gratitude <e> <s> it is that they have a problem for every solution <e> <s> that is the phrase i should like to use on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that very courteous response i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recollect that the words he used and i am paraphrasing perfectly fairly were that he would not disagree that the building was very suitable for use as an hotel or something of that kind <e> <s> does he realise that his department may be acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in the event of an appeal on planning <e> <s> does the noble lord therefore realise what he has said and the seriousness of it from that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission as i can only address the house once unless i am replying to the debate perhaps i may point out that there is the civil remedy of a mandatory injunction <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has been as frank with the house as the house has become accustomed to expect from him and we appreciate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only very briefly to deal with this amendment with but one observation <e> <s> we are dealing with criminal offences which become criminal offences for the first time in our law and we are giving powers to the police if this clause stands in regard to directions and in regard to offences which may result from a failure to deal with those directions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the noble earls reasoning here <e> <s> i should like to reflect on it in greater detail if i may <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no indeed my lords <e> <s> i have too much regard for the noble earl and the nuisance with which we are dealing ever to infer that <e> <s> i was merely saying possibly i should have said it from a standing position and not from a seated one that these matters are already covered and we are taking it for granted that they are agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i admire the noble earl for having made if i may say so an effective speech where i should have found it quite impossible to answer this debate <e> <s> i think he deserves to be congratulated by everyone in the house <e> <s> as i said i took another point of view on criminal law but one can readily understand that an urgent situation is created by those who are being abusive insulting or causing damage <e> <s> let me make it perfectly clear that the bill covers all those urgent matters so that it answers those of us who asked quite properly and reasonably can you imagine a farmer caught in those circumstances being told that he ought to see his solicitor who should be asked to apply for an injunction <e> <s> i remember the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter referring in somewhat caustic terms to the members at least of my profession on the basis that we never work over weekends <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that applies equally to the rest of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have had the privilege of briefing the noble lord on previous occasions i hope that that was not meant as a personal remark <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that explanation for which i am most grateful and on the basis that this will of course appear in the <e>", "<cs> smiling my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords how can one almost nod <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that it is not accepted by this house that undue criticism of parliamentary draftsmen should go <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is about the police use of video recordings <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister indicate what grants are made to the police to enable them to have these video recordings <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that this matter can be taken for one moment out of any political argument <e> <s> will he kindly deal with the question purely on the basis of humanity and practicality <e> <s> is he aware that many employers complain that their present employees find it difficult to be literate <e> <s> is he therefore aware that when he inflicts a number of the questions we have heard of today upon unfortunate people who are unemployed and may very well be lacking in literacy he is in fact perpetrating what is nothing less than a torture <e>", "<cs> i did not say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister if i may say so is doing what i did not do <e> <s> i did not seek to twist any words <e> <s> i am asking the noble lord how he expects thousands of unemployed people who have not had the benefit of the education we have had to answer questions of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not use those words <e>", "<cs> my lords what machinery exists for liaising with the local authorities other than sending out circulars in order that they may be kept up to date with the necessary research and the necessary activity from their own point of view should such an incident occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the reply that he gave to my original supplementary question even though it was not a reply to the question i put <e> <s> will he kindly indicate to the house what organisation exists so that all local authorities join in the information that is available and in planning the necessary activity so far as they are concerned in order to deal with the matters raised in the question of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> does he deem the matter to be of sufficient importance for a proper statement to be made in regard to these matters in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords while no one wishes to forecast legislation which one day may be before us will the noble earl have it firmly fixed in his mind that when we dealt with the penalties and possibilities in regard to drug offences we were dealing with exceptional matters and that they must not always be used as precedents in our criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones i too thought everything was brightness light and general contentment especially when i heard the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter say that he approved today of the behaviour both of the government and of the opposition <e> <s> this is indeed a unique day in the parliamentary history of this generation <e> <s> but i saw very soon a slight cloud a slight darkness almost a reactionary darkness in that cloud over our general enjoyment when he objected to a sentence of years only for the offence of riot <e> <s> i do not claim any monopolistic right on behalf of my noble friends in making that suggestion <e> <s> it was indeed the suggestion of the law commission itself that it should be only years and when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter finds himself even behind the law commission in its thoughts about matters maybe we can return to a spirit of complete contentment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a privilege of most of us to be so wise after the event <e> <s> was it wrong considering the humanity that was behind this decision to allow this man to attend custody <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recollect that he has just spoken about the great number of illiterate people among the long-term unemployed and has expressed regret in regard to it <e> <s> does he also recollect the question that i dared to put to him the other day about the effect of long questionnaires which are almost a torture for the illiterate <e> <s> does he further and lastly recollect that he completely misunderstood my question and got unnecessarily angry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the deep concern about this matter among parliamentarians of very high repute and that among those who have written to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has i am sure for good reason sentenced the house to a long term of imprisonment but i hope that in the remarks that i shall make to your lordships i shall grant you parole <e> <s> to turn to the noble earl lord longford i think the house would agree with me if i were to say that he so often beckons us with that very sincere and much-loved voice down several alleyways of philosophic thought and mercy <e> <s> sometimes it is wise to follow him right the way down the path <e> <s> sometimes it is wise to follow him only part of the way down that path <e> <s> but it is never wise to ignore him completely and i am sure that we are all very much indebted to him today not only for his speech but for introducing to the house this question which has been so very well debated <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that point and i am most grateful to the noble baroness for reminding us of it <e> <s> but as she rightly says they go before the parole board and then have to go before the home secretary <e> <s> i am therefore saying that without any judicial step without any step before judges those people who are about to be increased in number if the psychopathic offenders join with them will be subject to the parole board procedure together with the review and the final decison of the home secretary <e> <s> therefore as i said this whole system must be looked at very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will forgive me if i interrupt <e> <s> i especially did not go into the issues and said so that were before the european court <e> <s> i am obliged to him for saying that a decision has not been made and indeed he would not want to comment on it <e> <s> i shall not ask a question but purely for the record i referred to the facts of the case as showing something dreadfully wrong with our penal system when this matter concerned a young man of <e> <s> i shall not repeat that portion of my speech <e> <s> i am however obliged to the noble lord for what he said about the european court <e>", "<cs> my lords at the conclusion of the speech of the noble lord lord thurlow i noted with respect and some admiration that he quoted a former foreign secretary of this country mr ernest bevin as expressing a wish that is the wish of the idealist ever that we should reach a stage in world affairs where no passsports were necessary and when anyone could travel across boundaries and across countries without let or hindrance <e> <s> i hope that with due longevity we may reach that stage but i doubt it <e> <s> therefore because of the necessity for immigration control especially in this island home of ours crowded as it is i say at the very outset that immigration control has unfortunately to be effected <e> <s> i make no provisos <e> <s> i utter no qualification except for one that it must be effected with justice and without the suspicion of racial bias <e> <s> having said that may i at once make it clear that we on these benches support the motion so ably moved by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> indeed we would have put it down ourselves had he not with great perspicacity and promptitude done so himself <e> <s> i do not want from this dispatch box to throw across the floor accusations of racialism <e> <s> i do not think it would do any good i do not think that very probably it would have any justice in it <e> <s> what i do throw across the floor from this dispatch box is the accusation against a government who have done it before of ineptitude insensitivity and a dangerous lack of diplomacy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl who is always courteous goes on to another point can he give a simple explanation to the house as to why consultations did not take place beforehand <e> <s> there might then have been newspapers in india other than the one he has managed to single out which gave favourable comment <e> <s> are not the governments public relations very bad <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will once more give way i promise not to intervene again <e> <s> is he saying that courtesy to the representatives of these dominions in this country did not dictate any prior notice of what was happening and any opportunity for giving views about these immigration rules <e> <s> is that the standard of courtesy that her majestys government are now extending <e>", "<cs> my lords in the recent report which was given by the noble baronesss right honourable friend much emphasis was placed on a plan for poppy eradication in the dir district of pakistan <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell the house whether or not that plan has been successful and can she also indicate how many liaison officers have been placed in pakistan and south america <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a serious question after a rather facetious one on an important matter <e> <s> if the noble baroness does not have information about this plan which as i said was emphasised in the report on the dir district would she be kind enough to write to me about it <e> <s> however if she does have the information perhaps she can give it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the minister on the precise figures that he has given including the one round of ammunition at the end or the two rounds of ammunition at the end may i ask him what are the main disadvantages that the government see in granting this amnesty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am confident that your lordships will remember the lucid speech made by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in introducing this important bill <e> <s> as he rightly said there are various esoteric elements in it which i still believe will be understood by your lordships <e> <s> it must be so if i have persuaded myself that i understand those esoteric matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord always does his best and usually it is a good best <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will forgive me <e> <s> everything that he says is as usual correct <e> <s> i merely invited him to tell the house whether her majestys government would be prepared to advise a change in that procedure in view of the principle that he has enunciated with such eloquence that legitimate and illegitimate children should be treated in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for so clearly explaining the reasons for the supplementary treaty and draft order now before us <e> <s> as he rightly said there was a scandalous set of conditions following the wave of terrorism when we found that in the united states such a valued ally terrorists guilty of the most heinous crimes were being let off extradition by virtue of a claim that their actions were politically motivated <e> <s> the decision made in the san francisco court which the noble lord referred to was one which created a great deal of anger and <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the fact that most of us want to see more curative treatment in prison is this not an opportunity for dealing with a cause of crime and giving the women occupants of holloway the opportunity of having group therapy <e> <s> is that not something which would be a credit to the prison service <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers answer to my noble friend that there will be more accommodation available for women prisoners in holloway mean that the government are prepared to reconsider this question of group therapy for drug treatment if the number of prisoners at holloway goes up <e> <s> is the matter therefore still under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will find it convenient to have two submissions one after another

which provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to ask his right honourable friend to consider also the point of view that where the public is in danger and safety is at stake it is right to have a penalty possibly like clamping for obstruction and so on <e> <s> however if the government start using methods of that kind for collecting revenue where do we stop <e>",

that he has embarrassed me totally by his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity to ask whether the band is occasionally heard by schools so that the pupils learn to respect the police and like them as they should do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so glad and i believe that your lordships will be as well that the minister took such care in explaining the draft order to us <e> <s> incidentally i wonder whether the noble lord would kindly check whether he is right or whether my note is right <e> <s> i believe he said that the order was laid on th november whereas i have a note before me which says that it was laid on nd december <e> <s> although this matter is not of great moment i think the record at least ought to be correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord on his learned exposition of this order <e> <s> i thought he showed an expertise which many of us greeted with some surprise <e> <s> it was a very deep expertise on a very difficult matter <e>

one of the noble lords whom i mentioned spoke in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords it may very well be a form of proportional representation <e> <s> it certainly is not the form of proportional representation that i understood was being advocated this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords something tells me that i ought to move on to my next point <e>", "<cs> my lords my only comment is that i am deeply grateful that the leader of the opposition and my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones were not present during the pronunciation of some of the parts of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the most dangerous matters here is that mail order advertisements are published offering the most offensive weapons and are actually being directed to young members of a household <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether anything can be done about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the minister will forgive me if i return to the main burden of what i was saying which was related to the question of advertising and not to retail sale <e> <s> are the government aware of the dangers of this situation and is anything being done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wanting to repeat any of the very valid points that have been made can i ask that the investigation that is taking place into this matter includes the desirability of really worthwhile recruitment

agreement on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to consider at least one aspect when he is looking at the speeches that have been so learnedly delivered today <e> <s> i speak as one so ignorant on these matters that it may be that my question is not even a material one <e> <s> however it seems from a practical point of view that if one defines in a statute that the time has got to be precise when certain things occur namely the ovum being fertilised and if fertilisation takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would be courteous enough to agree that he has defended many people in his time and done it very ably but on this occasion he does not appear to me at least effectively to lave defended the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> if we had listened to one single reason as to why this amendment was not acceptable or if one had heard one single difficulty with which the court might be faced it would be different <e> <s> this is a sensible amendment as it seems to me which compresses into simple language and a couple of lines what is spelled out here in my view and i know it is the noble lords view too in quite unnecessary individual heads <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure to follow the noble lord lord meston largely because i agreed with everything that he said <e> <s> i therefore do not intend to repeat his speech which i am sure was warmly received by the house <e> <s> i say with him that the welfare of the child is pre-eminently in our mind as it is in all our recent legislation dealing with children <e> <s> the whole purpose of the bill is the eye that the law now casts which is a very different look from the previous aspects of the law upon the protection that the law can give to the dignity of a child born illegitimately through no fault of its own <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating the minister on the simplicity conciseness and clarity of his own language at the dispatch box will he encourage his colleagues to urge their own departments to word the replies given at question time with equal simplicity conciseness and in plain and straightforward english <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house would want to thank the noble earl for his patience and the secretary of state for the home department for his propriety in having made such a lengthy statement on matters which have caused grave public concern over a period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords following the very pertinent question from the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and so that there is no confusion on this matter is it not a fact that not only is there now no battle over this issue between the ministers department and the department of health and social security but indeed it is the decision of the home office and the home secretary that the wise course is to leave matters where they are under the mental health act <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that no reasonable person would ever define <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking as we all have done the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for yet another charitable act if i may say so in raising the whole question of charities perhaps it is pertinent in a winding-up speech from these benches on a subject in which there is no party dispute at all just to remind ourselves what we are dealing with when we talk about charities <e> <s> our law has deep roots <e> <s> none is deeper than the definitions of charity which date back to the reign of elizabeth i in a very learned

this discretionary right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from these benches to take this opportunity of commending the new procedure and of saying to the house how much more dignified this is than the old procedure that we had when all the facts of these at times rather sad matters had to come before us in open session <e>", "<cs> we are setting i hope an example if that is not said too pompously of how committee stages of bills should be dealt with in that there are short speeches and short replies <e> <s> i propose only to put one short question after thanking the noble earl for what he had to say which i obviously wish to consider <e> <s> he talked in terms of guidance being given <e> <s> can he say when those guidelines are likely to be issued <e> <s> will it be before the bill goes through parliament in all its stages <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble earl realises that there is a reverse side to the coin <e> <s> one may want to amend the bill because the guidelines are not satisfactory <e> <s> one may find that it is not necessary to amend it because the guidelines are satisfactory <e> <s> i hope that he will use his efforts and i am sure the committee will agree with me to ensure that those guidelines are produced as fast as possible and we hope before the bill finishes its passage through this house <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister was kind enough to write to me and explain the reasons for this amendment which i certainly do not oppose <e>", "<cs> the committee will have seen that this clause introduces fees for the first time as i understand it to he charged by fire authorities for their certification work <e> <s> it is expressly provided that the costs of inspections are not included and the committee may think that it is a very modest request that a fee should be charged when a certificate is granted or on an application for a certificate <e> <s> i am quite frankly frightened about the introduction of a charge of this kind even though it appears to come in in a very moderate way and on a very moderate basis <e>", "<cs> i regret that the minister has not made me very happy with his reply and i hope that a similar feeling of some discontent is in noble lords minds too <e> <s> we are not comparing like with like when we compare planning applications with an application for a fire certificate <e> <s> that is my first point <e> <s> my second point is that i readily admitted that the charges here would probably be very moderate indeed since they are only meant to cover the administrative cost of issuing the fire certificate <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl will forgive me if i ask him to describe to the committee with his usual frankness the nature of the charges in regard to that very ancient legislation which he mentioned <e>", "<cs> as i understood the noble earl he was saying that there is a precedent and he quoted <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has been very frank <e> <s> they obviously do not relate to the members of the public such as i was talking about they relate to sports matters and they relate to safety other than in regard to fire

judgment they would not properly earn <e> <s> if it is a fact that the effect of these words is to provide at all times why should not the words be included <e> <s> if the noble earl will explain that to me i shall rapidly consider my position <e>", "<cs> i cannot think that it is a useful expenditure of the committees time for me to continue this discussion <e> <s> i repeat to the noble earl what i said before <e> <s> why not have the provision in if that is what the clause means <e> <s> maybe in his great courtesy he will consider that question between now and report stage because i do not think as i said that i ought to delay the committee any longer on an amendment of this kind <e> <s> i accordingly ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that this will only be done in special circumstances <e> <s> this work is urgent and all that i sought to do was to say that a further extension could be granted <e> <s> the power is there <e> <s> the flexibility is there <e> <s> but there must be exceptional <e>", "<cs> i said i would consider a certain course of action <e> <s> i meant those words to be thoroughly menacing but they have had little effect upon the minister <e> <s> i do not think that i ought to call that menace an invitation to the committee at this stage of the bill to express a view on a matter of this kind <e> <s> i merely turn to the minister with i hope some pathos in my voice to ask him in the same spirit as i asked him last time whether or not he merely explains things by the use of words and they are very simple words and whether it would not be acceptable to the government to have them in if quite obviously in my judgment they do no harm <e> <s> with that plea to the minister i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister was good enough to say that my intentions in moving this amendment were laudable <e> <s> it seems that in moving amendments the more laudable my intentions the more intense his opposition <e> <s> however i ought to consider what the minister has been good enough to say <e> <s> in the meantime i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would never question the good faith of the noble earl <e> <s> i now know him too well ever to do such a thing <e> <s> i am indebted to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> to be called by the best debater in this place the best debater in this place is i suppose a compliment <e>", "<cs> i should obviously take up the points that the noble earl has made today with the fire authority and others who have made representations <e> <s> in order to enable me to do that may i have the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not ask for abundant keenness <e> <s> i ask only for acceptance such is my modesty <e>", "<cs> i shudder at that reply because i should have thought that if the popplewell committee mr justice popplewell himself had known that in regard to designated premises the government thought that in some cases they need not even be inspected once a year he would have been horrified after the matters into which he looked and the recommendations that he saw fit to make

to be a very vital matter of safety in sports grounds <e>", "<cs> on the basis of the good faith that exists between us if the noble lord the minister says that i take it for granted that he intends to look at that matter again <e> <s> in those circumstances it is sheer courtesy that i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certainly happy to look at that point with the same openness of mind that the noble lord the minister has recently shown <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall consider what the noble lord has said and in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> indeed i shall and i ask leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i stand by what i said <e> <s> mr justice popplewell made a very definite recommendation <e> <s> he has at no time withdrawn it <e> <s> so far as i am aware he is still in favour of this being incorporated in the bill <e> <s> if the noble earl can cite me a specific reference to any letter or statement made by mr justice popplewell saying that in his view this recommendation is no longer necessary i shall not take the course which i otherwise shall take <e>", "<cs> the straight question if i may ask it is this <e> <s> is it not correct that the same protection by way of a fire certificate as recommended by mr justice popplewell will not obtain if this bill is passed as at present worded <e>", "<cs> what the noble earl has said is perfectly fair and reasonable <e> <s> all of us are concerned only to see that the right answers are eventually given <e> <s> i sprang that point upon the noble earl <e> <s> he knows me well enough to know that i should never want to spring something on him without giving him a proper opportunity of dealing with it <e> <s>

indies which i think we all greeted with some amount of relief having regard to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recollect that in this house a short while ago and under the stewardship of lord chancellor we passed legislation to see that those who are born out of wedlock should suffer no disadvantage at law <e> <s> if he succumbs to the blandishments of the noble lord lord diamond will he kindly have that aspect in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is great public apprehension about the diversity of policies throughout the various courts in the land on the whole question of sentencing <e> <s> will he bear in mind the point that was made by the noble lord lord hunt about non-violent crimes and the points that have been made about remand <e> <s> in view of the serious situation does he think that there is room for an inquiry to be held jointly between his department and if appropriate the lord chancellors department to see whether there can be some adequate recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will understand why it is that i have not intervened on the matter concerning terms and conditions of service <e> <s> but so that the house knows the position i should like to ask him to give the present prison population and also give the limit to that population which has been set by the authorities as being a civilised limit <e>",

banner for many years in this house for his principles which he holds most sincerely <e> <s> sometimes the banner is tattered as a result of the shots that are fired at it whether through the press or otherwise but he marches bravely on and all of us hope that he will continue to do so in this house for many years <e> <s> it is in that spirit i am sure that we have listened to the debate on his question following upon his own if i may say so very warm and sincere speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that the noble minister with here usual courtesy and consideration would deal with a different aspect from statutory control before she ends her speech namely the suggestion that was mede that there should be an enforced contract to observe guidelines with the voluntary body the press association and the newspaper proprietors <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will want to thank the noble earl for the way in which he has introduced this order which comes before us year by year with as he has rightly said a heavy responsibility upon this house <e> <s> i believe i am quoting his very words he said that parliament should permit powers under this act to continue only if it considers that those powers are necessary <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble earl will admit that we cannot carry on a debate on this subject now <e> <s> however there is little point in introducing an order as the noble earl did so eloquently by saying that parliament has to be satisfied that each power is necessary if parliament cannot debate each power <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my thanks to the noble lord lord donaldson for introducing this vital matter and a word of apology to the house if i have to leave i hope that i will be forgiven immediately after concluding my speech as a result of a long-standing engagement for which i am already late <e>", "<cs> who my lords i do not represent in this house <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord confirm if

patron of that project <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the house to accept that the whole background of my response to this statement from these benches is based upon the great desire which i believe your lordships share that whatever national standards have for one reason or another to drop our great tradition of political and other asylum will not be spoilt <e> <s> i say that also stressing that i hope no one in this house i certainly would not from this dispatch box would ever defend any forgery or fabrication of documents done without good faith and done without good cause <e> <s> i use those words on purpose <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl proceeds with this matter i wonder whether he would forgive my intervention <e> <s> this subject is so vital to the house <e> <s> can he be a little less vague <e> <s> roughly how many forged or fabricated documents were used by the in december and january <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl and the house accept from these benches that we also feel for the difficult task that immigration officers mostly with great courtesy perform <e> <s> however before the debate on the statement finishes will he kindly deal with the point that was raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> does he feel as was mentioned before that refugees from iran and from many of the other troubled spots of the world at this moment can leave their shores without forged documents <e> <s> does he not know that to be a fact <e> <s> also will he accept from me that i have personal reason for gratitude to the secretary of state for the great consideration and mercy he has shown to many iranians whose cases i have put to him and to whose pleas he has responded with the utmost generosity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl and i ask for the houses permission to withdraw the amendment in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> if the house had been listening before the popplewell inquiry was set up and we had been talking in terms of sports stadia and the likelihood of incidents such as he inquired into i can imagine that with the good faith with which the minister has spoken this afternoon we would have been told by a government minister of whatever party do not worry you can rely upon the sense of responsibility of people who are housing thousands in a sports stadium <e> <s> you can rely on the fire authority not just inspecting but making sure that not only would the results of their inspection reach the responsible people but those responsible people would be made to carry out all the safeguards that would prevent a disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the concern of a certain trade union i have accentuated multi-occupied premises <e> <s> i hoped that i had made that point clear <e> <s> but in my amendment i am dealing with those premises which are mentioned in schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house has once again shown by its wisdom that a bill can be altered in a vital respect if only there is the combined wisdom of two benches expressed in this case from my point of view and i am sure with ineptitude and expressed by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with his usual facility of language <e>", "<cs> my lords in the ordinary way i should be delighted to accept what the noble lord lord beaverbrook has said but this is postponing the matter to the third reading <e> <s> i shall have very little opportunity of taking the opinion of the house on that occasion in the way that i should want <e> <s> if i may say so i am surprised that having heard all the arguments and knowing that this was popplewells recommendation the government have not made up their minds with certainty <e> <s> i think that it is parliament and not local authorities which has to make up its minds whether or not to follow mr justice popplewell <e> <s> i would have asked for the opinion of the house to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be unfair to the noble lord the minister i never would be and i am merely asking this question to which he need not reply if he does not wish to do so <e> <s> can the house be assured having heard the discussion on this amendment today that there will be a recommendation from the minister that there should be an annual inspection provision inserted in accordance with this amendment <e> <s> if he cannot tell the house that there will be that recommendation from the minister then i think the house must speak at report stage and follow popplewell <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand there are no amendments to be moved on third reading it would appear to be appropriate now to make remarks in regard to the bill as it is about to leave your lordships house <e> <s> it is a rather meaningful lesson that we are dealing with the passing and the last stages of the bill at a time when parliament and the nation are in mourning over the terrible happenings near zeebrugge because this bill found its origin in another disaster <e> <s> irrespective of which party may be in government it is noticeable that so often we find ourselves legislating because of a disaster <e> <s> it would appear to be so much more the duty of parliament i repeat whatever party happens to be in power to see that there are no disasters because those disasters have been prevented by the care that parliament has shown in passing safety legislation in vital fields <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister like to take this opportunity on behalf of the whole house of paying its tribute to the work of the rspca <e> <s> is not one of the objects of the rspca in order to counter cruelty in some way to obtain legislation not so much on penalties but on allowing the police by law the right to enter through a warrant premises where cruelty to animals is anticipated or suspected <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl for returning to the dispatch box but when parliament allows police to enter premises even the bbc on some occasions in order to inspect documents does it not seem weird that the government are not prepared to consider a warrant when animal cruelty is suspected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those present in your lordships house at the moment will welcome the regulations <e> <s> indeed local authorities outside the house will equally see that the government are supporting the very essential civil defence work that those authorities ought to do <e> <s> we pray that they will never have to use those powers in an emergency regarding civil defence <e> <s> on these benches we think that the regulations come appropriately and we are glad that full per cent <e> <s> grants will be made in the circumstances that the noble lord lord beaverbrook so clearly explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i hope that he will not feel that i am being discourteous <e> <s> can he tell me if not now by letter what provision makes that measure applicable outside scotland <e> <s> he broadly said that that happens to be the position outside scotland <e> <s> will he refer to the regulation measure or provision in some statute where that is clearly laid down <e> <s> i shall understand if he cannot do that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am being a nuisance and i apologise for intervening but these matters are of some importance <e> <s> the minister is being his usual helpful self <e> <s> i asked whether members of staff who are being paid for by a per cent <e> <s> grant by the government in the civil protection department and who are called out on a civil emergency and spend for example three days out of one week dealing with that civil emergency would have their salary for the three days which is not civil defence deducted for the purpose of grant <e> <s> it would seem to be absurd if that were the case <e> <s> that was the question i was asking <e>", "<cs> my lords was the noble earl the minister being as frank as he normally is in his reply to the question asked by my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> did he not on th february utter these word in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will forgive me if i return for one moment to this point <e> <s> i find his reply now extremely refreshing and much more typical of him <e> <s> does this not mean that he would not make the statement now that he made on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords following the very witty intervention of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> would the minister care to ask his noble friend lord massereene and ferrard whether he intends to be a militant propagandist for designating his area crossbow-free <e>", "<cs> my lords while i in no way wish to belittle the essential programme which as the noble lord has said costs the country some million i should like to ask this question <e> <s> in view of the terrific number of offences connected with cars would it not also be worthwhile to see that implements or gadgets are compulsorily fitted to cars to safeguard them <e> <s> secondly is it not sensible to see that there are more police on beats so that crime may be prevented practically rather than merely by advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords while noting the impeccable answer given by the minister on this occasion may i ask him whether his recollection extends back to his answer in regard to county hall and does he remember that his reply then was not so impeccable <e> <s> in regard to this matter will he take a hint from his noble friend and consider that this is an aspect of national importance and therefore a proper issue for the minister to call in as a matter of policy if and when an application is made <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon what the house may be surprised to learn is my noble and learned friends maiden question may i ask the minister this <e> <s> bearing in mind that there is a feeling among all parties that section must be amended and bearing in mind our recent painful experience of that section would it not be worthwhile to consider setting up an all-party committee which may be presided over by either the speaker or the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with a view to seeing whether unanimity can be obtained in getting this section amended at long last <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take it for granted that the governments view in regard to these dreadful cases is one that is shared in all parts of your lordships house <e> <s> will the noble earl also consider whether there is a case for examining the possibility of corroborative evidence being available and in that event the prosecution being able to rely upon that corroborative evidence without subjecting a child to any cross-examination at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have sympathy with the minister who has been dealing with the very materialistic subject of banking in assisting his noble friend and now has to move to a humanitarian subject when moving the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i congratulate him on the clarity with which he denned the objects of the bill but he will not be surprised having regard to the debate that took place on the statement which was repeated in this house when the bills purpose was announced if i tell him in forthright terms that we on this side of the house regard this bill as wanting in mercy and understanding contrary to our best traditions ill thought-out and conceived in an unnecessary panic <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord with his usual courtesy will give way since he mentioned my name in the argument <e> <s> perhaps he did not understand me but would he deal with the point which i make <e> <s> i was concerned with the genuine refugee who could not obtain a proper passport or proper papers <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the cautious carrier would say if there was the slightest degree of doubt i am not taking you <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord who advised so many in the courts over which he presided and when he was an esteemed member of the bar advise the carriers even if they thought that the person was a genuine refugee from persecution who did not have papers the absence of which he could explain to run the risk of a fine of <e> <s> that is the issue in this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds he will remember that i quoted the safeguards that the home office then put forward as being a proper substitute for any right of appeal <e> <s> is he prepared to say to the house that the safeguards that the government then mentioned will still be applicable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me for one moment so that i can follow the point <e> <s> the minister is therefore saying on behalf of the government that the safeguards which have operated safely and well up till now will still be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister listen to the voice of sweet reasonableness <e> <s> in regard to the judgment of the divisional court of the queens bench would he not agree that as the judgment was delivered on nd march and as the matters dealt with especially if i may say so by the learned lord justice watkins are matters of some urgency the home secretary should have formed some opinion before now on just two of the main points <e> <s> the first one is that the divisional court decided that to wait for three or four years before fixing the term that should be served by a prisoner for retribution and deterrence was wrong and that this should be done soon after the sentence if not at the time of sentence and that the home secretary should take regard of the wishes of the judiciary and should not impose his own views when deciding this period <e> <s> does not the noble lord think that those two matters are somewhat simple to decide upon in regard to policy having regard to the clear judgment of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that at every opportunity in this house and in another place members have expressed their opprobrium of acts of victimisation of immigrants to this country including specifically the asian community <e> <s> in view of the exchanges that have taken place today will the minister consider ensuring that the police consult community leaders especially in east london so that reports are made of acts of victimisation <e> <s> will he also ensure that they visit various places in those areas in order to make it quite clear that such complaints will be taken very seriously <e>", "<cs> turkey is not an ec country <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems a very long time since the minister made his introductory speech to this bill a bill described as a hotch-potch ragbag by two of the principal speakers for the alliance <e> <s> one admires the political objectivity which they have shown in such a description <e> <s> i noted that the noble lord lord wigoder said that he intended to keep politics out of this completely <e> <s> i with far more objectivity but without trumpeting it before the house will not indulge in that description at all but will merely say that this bill has merits in some parts of it and demerits in another and it is our hope that the house will turn out a better bill than it now is <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister hear his noble friend lord glenarthur refer to sea trout as opportunistic feeders <e> <s> would he care to adopt that definition as regards the betting industry <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord mottistone whether his contribution to this debate is that we should encourage people to dress up as catholic priests and come over with really well-forged passports and that that is the way to come into this country <e> <s> is that his argument <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly sure that the noble lord lord donaldson would agree with me that there are exceptions which prove the rule and when he generalised in regard to lawyers in this chamber he was looking with some degree of affection i hope at the exception which proved the rule <e>", "<cs> i should always be happy to have the noble lord associated with any amendment of mine <e> <s> it is a strange experience which i enjoy when it happens <e>", "<cs> it is very difficult to answer a charming speech of that kind with anything other than charm <e> <s> however i am not so capable in that respect as the noble earl <e> <s> i wish that i could catch his charm from across the front benches <e>", "<cs> he appears <e> <s> a great many speeches have been made on this amendment of which if i may humbly say this as an ordinary member of this chamber i shall always be proud when i remember this bill <e> <s> if i may say so it was the house of parliament at its best because it was realistically expressing our peoples great traditions <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble viscount lord tonypandy that our people feel that enough is enough with regard to immigration <e> <s> i do not know that that is a happy situation for any civilised country to put up with remembering the old wish of ernest bevin that he would live to see the day when passports were unnecessary and people could go where they wanted <e> <s> we all know that that is a utopia still far removed from our vision <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl is stopping me to say that there is no need for a division i am delighted to give way <e>", "<cs> i wish crises took place in the world in a way which gave the ambassador to the country concerned on the basis that we had an ambassador there and had not withdrawn him because of what was happening in that country time to communicate with the foreign office that the foreign office had time to communicate with the home office that the home office had time to communicate with all the carriers in that country and that those carriers had time to communicate with their junior officials and say we have heard from the united kingdom government <e> <s> you can now let these people go <e> <s> crises do not occur in that way <e> <s> i wish to heaven that they did <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is most unusually mentally confused <e> <s> if it be as a result of my having talked to your lordships for too long i humbly apologise to him <e> <s> his mental confusion is in the following direction first as the noble lord lord mcnair said in a clear intervention he was not necessarily talking about refugees as described in the convention he was talking about people who stand in grave or immediate danger as mentioned in the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i have missed the point in spite of the fact that i may be imposing upon the patience of the committee as the noble lord will do i invite him kindly to make the point that i have not answered <e>", "<cs> those vague words are not worthy of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am wondering upon which side of the house the noble earl will be answering such a question in the future <e> <s> i would assure him that this front bench is a very comfortable one and he would occupy any position on it with distinction and grace <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord who obviously intended to assist both me and the committee by his observations <e> <s> i respectfully differ where it is purely a case of discretion i notice that the noble and learned lord lord denning is nodding his head and i take that to be a mark of approval of my submission <e> <s> i think that it would be a matter of the carrier being unable to question whether the secretary of state had exercised his discretion in the way that the carrier thought he ought <e> <s> if the secretary of state had exercised that discretion in an honest way if i may put it in that way there would be no answer to a county court or high court action for the penalty <e> <s> again i am encouraged by the fact that the noble and learned lord has nodded his head <e> <s> it is something that i used to look for in the court of appeal but found all too infrequently when i was the appellant <e>", "<cs> i have a doubt in my mind as to whether it would not be within the power of the secretary of state where in an act of parliament he has a penalty of to say that he will not exact the whole amount but will ask for only <e> <s> i think that if he has the power to exact a penalty of it would be perfectly proper for him to exact a lesser sum <e> <s> however i am most grateful to the noble lord for pointing out something which deserves consideration between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> i add a protest which is a common one in your lordships house against any retrospective legislation <e> <s> i ask the minister to consider between now and report stage not only whether the notifications should be followed up by exacting a penalty but whether in view of the discussions that have taken place both in another place and in your lordships house it would not be just to say before this legislation reaches the statute book if it ever does that it will take effect as from the royal assent and certainly not from the date which is anticipated namely th march <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the committee remembers having read if noble lords read it the speech with which the secretary of state introduced this bill at second reading in another place <e> <s> i intend to read only the first two sentences of his speech which appears at col of the <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl because i think he has suggested a most sensible amendment that might be put down at report stage <e> <s> i am grateful to him for it and i in no way interpret his words as being a commitment to accept such an amendment <e> <s> but as it so wisely came from his mouth i know that at least it will have his wise consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> does the minister agree that to a large extent his office is responsible for the good name of the police <e> <s> was he therefore interested enough to find out the result of the meetings between the metropolitan police authorities and the chairman of the police complaints authority <e> <s> was an agreed procedure for the future arrived at as a result of those two meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recollect that in the debate on security matters and the overseeing of them the suggestion was made that the security commission possibly strengthened by the appointment of a judge at first instance might indeed take on the supervision of the security service and in its wisdom report to parliament <e> <s> has that suggestion been looked into and if not will it be <e>", "<cs> with what result my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has with his usual courtesy brought to your lordships the recollection of debates that took place in this chamber when i had the pleasure of moving an amendment rather similar to the one which now comes to us from the other place <e> <s> this is an improvement to the bill and <e>", "<cs> my lords here again we are reminded of discussions that took place in this house <e> <s> i recollect with gratitude not only the views that were expressed from my own front bench but the support that we so often received from the noble lord lord brougham and vaux <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity in case i forget on another occasion to thank him for his support <e>", "<cs> my lords very sensible it is too <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another sensible amendment coming to us from another place and i certainly support it from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one example if the minister will forgive me for saying so of bad legislation as a result of too much rush <e> <s> one really wonders whether questions of safety ought to be imperilled merely because a government are anxious to get legislation through in time to satisfy a general election date <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister even at this late hour would make the position clear to the house <e> <s> regulations are made under the powers given to the secretary of state in the act <e> <s> the secretary of state delegates that right as i understand it to what i prefer to call sib <e> <s> if that is so and regulations are made under powers given under an act are they or are they not statutory <e>", "<cs> my lords what an entertaining end to an adventurous and dramatic day in your lordships house <e> <s> a speech always scintillating from the noble lord lord wyatt <e> <s> we rejoice in this house that we have some of the enjoyment that another place had for many years and that we are able at times to read him in the papers in his style which all of us appreciate even if we do not always agree with the content of the article <e> <s>

earl inform the house whether from the reports that he has received so far it looks as though the alcohol provisions which came into recent legislation passed by parliament have helped in keeping down hooliganism at football grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords while the question of civil liberties may arise in regard to questions of this kind perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> can the noble earl assure the house that there is no question of scientology or any allied cause achieving charitable status in this country <e> <s> if that is not the position have the government any plans to alter the charity law in order to make such a position impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords what a succinct and learned observation from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is equivalent to the most lengthy and eloquent speech <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway will forgive me if i say that in extending the ambit of this amendment some confusion has possibly been infused into the debate <e> <s> as i understood it there was a simple amendment which was answered very clearly or not so clearly by the minister namely that the penalty of had not to be exacted in every case and that it was within the power of the secretary of state to exact a penalty of a lesser sum if he so decided <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down for my clarification at all events if not to assist other members of your lordships house i wonder whether he would explain his remark that theoretically the secretary of state could exact a lesser penalty <e> <s> i took note of his words <e> <s> either he has the power to charge a lesser sum under an act of parliament which is a very pragmatic proceeding or he has not <e> <s> i do not understand the use of the word theoretically <e> <s> will he clarify this important matter and say what will happen in the circumstances that i ventured to outline to your lordships namely the case in which somebody has acted flagrantly in carrying somebody and made a huge profit out of it and the case where a carrier employs a not too intelligent official who happens to think that a passport is genuine when it is in fact an obvious forgery <e> <s> does that mean that the secretary of state has to exact precisely the same penalty in both cases or that he does not exact a penalty at all <e> <s> or is the minister saying that there is the power to charge less and to exact a lower penalty and that that is what he terms theoretically <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the attitude of the house may be very much guided by the response of the minister <e> <s> i hope that he will repeat in even stronger terms so that they are clearly on the record that if a carrier is carrying a passenger under a genuine government order be it by way of deportation or whatever in other words carrying him is a matter of compulsion there is no doubt that in a proper case the secretary of state would exercise discretion <e> <s> if i may humbly suggest it if the secretary of state would give that categorical assurance on the record in even clearer terms than those uttered at committee stage many of us may be assisted <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am interrupting the noble lords train of thought which is always a very interesting one i shall sit down and ask for his leave to interrupt him at another stage <e> <s> is he really saying to the house and if so will the minister kindly deal with the matter that where submissions have been made in mitigation by a carrier and the secretary of state sends a short reply to the effect that they have been considered but the penalty is being exacted a county court judge can then go into the matter all over again even though correspondence had been shown to the judge to the effect that submissions had been made to the secretary of state who had considered them and then decided against them <e> <s> is the noble lord seriously saying to the house as a matter of law that when the secretary of state then sues for the penalty the county court judge the high court judge on appeal or the court of appeal can look again at the matters in respect of which he had properly exercised his discretion but exercised it against the carrier <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will pardon the interruption i promise him it will be for the last time what he is saying is most serious because it will be in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down and only because of the importance of the point may i say with deep deference that he has said exactly what i was trying to say <e> <s> in other words once you get to the county court if the secretary of state proves that there has been a breach of this bill then the county court judge or the high court judge has no alternative whatever but to say the secretary of state said and it is <e> <s> he cannot hear the defendant <e>", "<cs> may i just finish my sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was not trying to silence my argument <e> <s> it is the last thing in the world that i would ever expect of him <e> <s> i was saying it is the whole purport of my address to your lordships that the necessity for an appeal tribunal is to be able to go to somebody and say look i submitted this to the secretary of state or new evidence has come to light and i want you to find that it is wrong to exact a penalty of from me you may think it should be only or nothing at all <e> <s> he has no right and the noble and learned lord has confirmed it to do that in the county court <e>", "<cs> i do <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am considerate enough not to make a further speech i stand a chance of receiving more support from your lordships than if i do <e> <s> i merely intend to say that i believe that this is a matter of such importance that the opinion of the house should be tested <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the expression of regret from the noble earl <e> <s> i too regret his reply but realise that there would be no point in this instance in testing the opinion of the house <e> <s> i therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill passes through your lordships house and with the speed to which we shall be accustomed over the next few days finds it way on

cheats and secondly the carrier who makes a fortune or endeavours to do so out of the misery of others <e> <s> we join the government in wanting to make provision in legislation to defeat both those sets of people <e>", "<cs> my lords seldom in the long and glorious history of this house has there been such a session of legislative devastation <e> <s> from these benches we certainly wish to

one of the major issues we face as a nation that of law and order with the seriousness which it undoubtedly deserves even if in the content of that speech he dealt in our view inadequately with the size of the problem and the steps that need to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not usually quote the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with approval but may i too congratulate the minister on the excellent way in which he answered his first question <e> <s> would he please promise not to do as well in future <e> <s> whatever else may be delayed in the passport office will the noble lord agree to instruct his staff there to be as dilatory as possible in issuing european community passports in the place of our good old united kingdom passsport <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure your lordships

to allow consideration of the matters to which the noble lord lord wigoder referred such as the matter of the representatives of the irish bar appearing before him which i know he would with his usual courtesy wish to happen but also because of certain political considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords i was denied the pleasure of listening to the opening speech of the noble earl and also to subsequent

government of the conservative party in consecutive terms and then start referring to what other government have or have not done in the past <e> <s> one cannot have it both ways <e> <s> it is much more sensible that this house seriously considers this as a national crisis and a national issue and that we pool our brains to try to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl misunderstood me <e>", "<cs> my lords i too rise to thank the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for allowing us to debate a most important report and a matter of grave consequence to the nation <e>

national affairs would they consider holding a national holiday in celebration on st april <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to this interesting debate on semantics by differing if i may respectfully do so from the two noble lords who have just spoken <e> <s> on the one hand i should have thought that the word facts betokens matters which are established <e> <s> they are facts <e> <s> on the other hand the word evidence merely means that somebody has testified to something <e> <s> it may be found to be fact or it may be found not to be fact <e> <s> the word evidence therefore is different from facts <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i prefer to be the black sheep of europe and to maintain our tradition of being the white sheep of the liberty of the subject <e>", "<cs> i thought it was the usual learned comment of the noble and learned lord but it was made to somebody else and not to me <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to prolong what i believe to be a debate which should now close <e> <s> however i wonder whether the minister has realised into which troubled water he is trying to guide the committee <e> <s> is he saying that those who join with us in europe shall have one system of extradition <e> <s> if another country approaches us in respect of an extradition treaty and says that it is just as good as our fellow nations in europe does the minister realise the task he has given to his right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign affairs if the decision is you are not as good as france you are not as good as west germany you are not as good as spain you are not as good as portugal you are not as good as greece <e> <s> i think that the minister is moving the committee into difficult reefs and that is something which i should not like to see happen and upon further reflection i believe that he may not like that <e>", "<cs> we could go on for a very long time making speeches in order to clarify one or two words <e> <s> the noble earl has said that he

to catch the mood on all sides of the committee <e> <s> i say that with some emphasis <e> <s> he has not in any way yielded by agreeing to withdraw the clause <e> <s> the only comment that he has made which is of the slightest use i say this with all politeness is that he will consider an amendment to deal with representations being made to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble earl will forgive me if i immediately dash to the dispatch box and say that that was not my point <e> <s> my point was that if it is offensive to europe to say that we still want the <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble earl on behalf of the official opposition that when he spoke on those two amendments and thought there was no controversy at all we had nothing to say in regard to those arguments or those amendments <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for referring me to what happened in committee in another place of which let me tell him at once i was unaware <e> <s> he is very kind and i can see the sense of what he is saying <e> <s> i would only say to him without taking up any more time of the committee that the word admissible does in fact infer certainly to the layman that it is to be admitted and i entirely agree that the literal translation or meaning of the word is that it is able to be admitted <e> <s> the word shall also gives a mandatory tinge to it <e> <s> in spite of what the noble earl was kind enough to tell me about what happened in another place i can see no objection to the use of the word may in these circumstances <e> <s> i certainly do not on a matter of this kind intend to delay the committee and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> some of us may be rather disappointed with the latter part of the speech of the noble earl encouraged as we were by the beginning when he said i am paraphrasing his words that he could understand the reason for the amendment <e> <s> i thought that he was implying that he had some sympathy with it <e> <s> the only reason given by the minister for rejecting this amendment is that he thinks it is already provided for <e> <s> i can only tell him with deep respect that the following principle is at stake <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that intervention <e> <s> while this might occur to him if he were the trial judge i am sure it would i am not quite so certain that some other <e>", "<cs> my lords i should only like to add to what the noble and learned lord has said by agreeing that this is a useful consolidation and paying a tribute to apart from the law commission because i now suitably can as i am no longer a member of the committee the arduous work done by the committee of both houses dealing with the consolidation of bills <e>

one word in support of the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> i think that he possibly wrongly interpreted what the minister said <e> <s> if he did so i am sure that he will welcome my observation if he did not i apologise for wasting the time of the committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl does that and it is very gracious of him i should like to make clear from my point of view the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington obviously will add to it if he sees fit that all the minister is offering this is not what the noble lord lord campbell of alloway understood or if he did so understand i did not understand his speech is that the court may in its discretion take into account the absence or presence of this facility to cross-examine <e> <s> if the court thought it was all right to admit it even though no such right had been given it would be competent for the court to do it <e> <s> this amendment states that provision ought to be made <e> <s> that is the great difference between the two points of view <e>", "<cs> i find it awfully difficult to remain silent i believe that is the common view of the committee <e> <s> i think that on a matter of this kind where one has the dual duty of safeguarding an accused and at the same time helping a child many of us want humbly to listen to the debate and then come to a conclusion <e> <s> if an opposition or a government in this place of all places were to have firmly fixed views before hearing the debate the whole procedures of the committee on a matter of this kind would be abortive in my view <e> <s> that is the position of the opposition <e> <s> i hope it is the same position on the government benches <e>", "<cs> i think we are all trying very hard to carry out the duties to which i tried humbly to refer before <e> <s> it is difficult <e> <s> i am trying to envisage the practicalities of this amendment and i mention a point which i believe has not been mentioned so far <e> <s> one can imagine that in a few cases the parties whoever they may be may indeed agree to a person in whom both parties if it is just the two the prosecution and the defence have confidence asking and obtaining answers to certain questions <e> <s> i cannot envisage anyone on behalf of the defence doing this without the questions being agreed beforehand <e>", "<cs> may i at once dissociate myself from my junior counsel <e>", "<cs> how right i think it was at the very beginning when i answered from the front bench the courteous challenge of the minister as to where the opposition stood on some provisions of the bill <e> <s> the one thing that i should have regretted very much for the dignity of the committee is if now that we have indulged in this debate which has been painful for many people and certainly very mind-searching the division bell had rung and people had wandered in who had not heard one single speech and cast their votes in one lobby or another in a matter which affects the lives of so many of our children and others in the country <e> <s> it has been a good debate <e> <s> i should have thought those who talked about having to consider the matter further were correct <e>", "<cs> it falls to my lot to try to draw the strands together of this very vital debate on behalf of the official opposition and i hope on behalf of our friends who sit on the alliance benches <e>", "<cs> i am corrected by the noble earl who refers me to the fact that he was dealing here with criminal justice <e> <s> i am referring to the judges of australia who sit both in civil and criminal jurisdictions <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> no it was not a drunken driver it was a negligent driver <e> <s> the man was of completely good character <e> <s> he had driven in a negligent fashion and unfortunately people

mercy had not occurred to him then when he reflected that the person who was before him was of completely good character <e> <s> he had driven negligently <e> <s> he might have gone into a lamp post and the matter then would have been dealt with by a fine <e> <s> he unfortunately went into a human being or two human beings and the result was disastrous <e> <s> does that mean that the noble and learned lord was not right <e> <s> he sentenced the man to prison <e> <s> he sentenced him to nine months in prison <e> <s> i believe that the noble and learned lord was right in that judgment <e> <s> he is nodding his head and possibly on reflection he now thinks he was <e> <s> thank heavens he did not have this amendment passed in law when he administered the sentence that he did <e>", "<cs> with his usual courtesy the noble earl has sat down to enable me to intervene <e> <s> i made it perfectly clear in my speech however ineffectual that speech might be that clause was in fact an improvement by far on this amendment and i hoped that that was the compromise that the noble earl was about to accept <e> <s> what i say quite definitely is that the government have not yet explained and no doubt the noble earl will now do so why they changed their mind about clause <e>", "<cs> could the noble earl summarise it <e>", "<cs> i have given way many times as the committee will have seen <e> <s> i

chamber <e> <s> there is a decision of parliament <e> <s> in my view to deal with a matter of this kind by way of an amendment to the criminal justice bill is quite offensive to the common sense of the committee <e> <s> that is why i so profoundly agreed with my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones when he said that we on this side i had hoped that it was the universal view of the committee should reject these proposals in totality and that indeed they should not be dignified by any further debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept a suggestion <e> <s> after years use the british passport may not look as respectable as it should <e>", "<cs> i wish that the committee were discussing amendments nos <e> <s> a and together <e> <s> i am firmly of the view that they should have been grouped together <e> <s> we should then have had a very worthwhile debate with something meaningful in any vote that was taken <e> <s> to distinguish between amendments nos <e> <s> a and by way of separate debates seems to me to lead to an inconclusive result <e>", "<cs> i remember so well mr justice avery having a shot at taking the part of god and i remember one case for which he was quite famous <e> <s> he was a hard judge and was known to be such but he dealt with a wave of crime in his own way <e> <s> on one occasion he sentenced a man who had been before the courts on many occasions and who was years old to years imprisonment <e> <s> the man said from the dock but my lord i wont live that long <e> <s> to which the learned judge replied do your best my man <e> <s> so if we make a determinate sentence and there is no life sentence quite obviously some judges moved by the severity of the crime and the circumstances of it may impose a very long term <e> <s> but i do appreciate that that would be subject to appeal <e>", "<cs> before he sits down will the noble earl also undertake to consider and i only say consider the question of including in this bill a provision which allows the crime of unlawful killing to cover both murder and manslaughter as it now exists <e>", "<cs> before this debate is concluded i should like to make a couple of observations which i hope will be of use <e> <s> the first one is that people inside prisons regard us we are supposed to be the voice of authority as being the people who are responsible for the conditions in which they are expected to live <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will permit me to interrupt only because one is anxious to get something constructive out of the amendment which deserves to be treated seriously <e> <s> in old premises one cannot in the foreseeable future get the standard one wants <e> <s> what i believe all sides of the committee are asking for is this <e> <s> it may be that in some cases we shall not reach what the noble baroness lady ryder whom we were also delighted to hear this evening called a target <e> <s> we must have a target <e> <s> it may be a target which we shall not be able to reach for five years or in some cases or years <e> <s> what we want is the target and we want it to be a civilised target which is agreed by the home office as being the eventual aim with every reasonable excuse understood as to why that aim cannot be reached in a few years time <e> <s> it may take much longer <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister has considered the discussions which have been taking place in another place on this very matter <e> <s> naturally all of us will be with him in endeavouring to control the possession of firearms <e> <s> all of us remember the disaster <e> <s> it is unfortunate that disasters have to occur before parliament decides to act <e> <s> some of us remember discussions at question time that have taken place since i became a member of this chamber on the question of further provisions to control the possession of firearms and penalties if those regulations are broken <e>", "<cs> since i have been asked a question i must answer it <e> <s> the standard of my golf is such that i find i do just as well with one club as with many <e> <s> however to take this matter more seriously there are regulations proposed by the home office in my view very proper regulations which govern the possession of knives and other instruments which can be used offensively <e> <s> i feel that what has happened unfortunately at hungerford and could happen elsewhere deserves at least the attention of the authorities with a view to seeing whether or not be it at a club or through restriction of numbers we have gone quite far enough in our restriction of firearms <e> <s> that was all that i was asking the secretary of state together with the minister to consider <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about the reference to the chief whip who i am sorry to see is not in his place <e> <s> it is obviously proper for a chief whip to try to expedite business <e> <s> however i think that the committee will want to bear in mind the serious provisions with which we are dealing in the bill <e> <s> if the committee has to sit for one extra day in order that its deliberations shall be as full and as sensible as they should be i believe that noble lords will not think that to be a gross burden upon the shoulders of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> between now and report stage or possibly at report stage can the noble earl indicate that it is the definite intention of the government to carry through the recommendations of the carlisle committee if approved by parliament in speedy amending legislation <e> <s> again that may help us because we are all anxious to carry through sensible reform but i hope that we shall be able to do so speedily <e> <s> if it cannot be done speedily by the amending bill we shall have to consider doing it in this bill <e>", "<cs> i only want to throw one thought into the discussion if i may <e> <s> it may not be known to all members of your lordships committee that the phrase special reasons does not mean what the layman may think it means <e> <s> special reasons have been limited to special reasons relating to the offence and not special reasons relating to the offender <e> <s> if therefore you have a minimum sentence of three years and a family is going to be made destitute because a person who has offended relies upon driving for his livelihood and i am not here to plead for extreme leniency for people who by reckless driving have caused death one ought to remember that the court would not be able to take into account the factor i have just mentioned or anything relating to special reasons that apply to the offender as such <e>", "<cs> i too thought that there was a glint in the eye of the minister but it must have been that he had decided at that stage to reward the committee with a speech in which he said that everything in the amendment moved by my noble and learned friend was understandable and good but that unfortunately there was a reason why it could not be inserted in this bill <e> <s> possibly the glint was an indication that the minister thought that with those words he would satisfy the committee <e> <s> perhaps i may say that in those circumstances i do not think that the glint was at all justified <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will allow me to make one observation <e> <s> although we support the amendment moved so well by the noble lord lord morton of shuna it seems to some of us that it is a little clumsy to have criminal provisions that one does not mean to be criminal provisions at all <e> <s> it is not the way that parliament normally legislates <e>", "<cs> would the noble and learned lord again consider since we have had a long discussion now about the type of matters which should be covered by compensation whether instead of trying to do a very difficult thing namely to include all these matters within this bill it would be wiser to have a general provision that by order the type of matters that can be covered by the board in giving compensation should be placed before parliament <e>", "<cs> it is a sad thing if the committee has to reflect that over the past few years we have been chipping away at our system of justice and at many principles that we have held dear because of a situation which all of us find deplorable namely the increasing crime rate <e> <s> the increasing crime rate one hopes will disappear <e> <s> what remains will be the decisions of your lordships committee as to how we have dealt with solemn principles of justice <e> <s> we have been chipping away at the onus of proof <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take into account that sometimes the ringing of bells at seaside places will in itself constitute a security <e> <s> and will the minister reflect upon this point <e> <s> the question of security at party conferences is one that all of us recognise as being essential especially after the tragic events in brighton of which all members of your lordships house have some very vivid and sad memories <e> <s> is it not a fact though that this is a question of protecting national figures of whatever party it may be at a conference of a national party <e> <s> is it not therefore right that a central fund should bear the responsibility for these costs whatever political denomination that conference happens to have <e>", "<cs> i think the committee is indebted to the noble baroness lady faithful for having introduced the subject by way of this amendment even if it is a probing amendment <e> <s> we are equally indebted to the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood for the way in which she has supported it <e>", "<cs> the minister can rest assured that he has the support of those who sit on these benches for the amendment that he has just moved <e> <s> it was very reassuring to hear him say in such emphatic language that for the reasons he gave this is not a revival of any part of the sus law <e> <s> apart from expressing our general support for this measure the only other reason for my rising to speak is in order to make a plea to the minister for clarification <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is always helpful but all he is doing is making another speech in the middle of mine <e> <s> i thought he was intervening in order to deal with a point that i raised <e> <s> i feel that it would not be very tidy if we now had another speech on another subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone was helping <e> <s> he can now see how effective that help has been <e>", "<cs> i should be more than content with that because it is a typically courteous reply <e> <s> but will the noble earl take on board the point that we are now asked to pass the amendment <e> <s> i ask the committee to forget the question of the english of the first exception and that it ought to be in positive terms and not in negative terms <e> <s> we are excepting a pocket knife which locks when open <e> <s> in other words if you are in possession of a pocket knife which locks when open regardless of the length of the blade you are not committing an offence <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl has said and in view of the very helpful suggestion if i may say so that was made by the noble and learned lord lord havers we can quite happily pass this amendment it being clearly understood what we are intending to pass and that being clearly stated if necessary in another amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the memories of your lordships may go back some of them nostalgically and some not so nostalgically to the deliberations of the house on the data protection bill <e> <s> this is the first time so far as i recollect that the provisions have been brought back here in such a positive form in that after due consideration the exemptions of the rights of data subjects are being considered in four fields which your lordships may have felt appropriate after the very clear explanation given by the noble earl of the provisions of these orders for which we are all indebted to him <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> good <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened with admiration and appreciation to the way in which this order has been moved by the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack <e> <s> he has given us a very clear view of the state of affairs in our various courts and of the need to speed up in the interests of justice trials in courts of first instance and appeals in the two divisions of the court of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords although i cast no criticism on anybody at this stage perhaps i may tell the minister that the first time we on these benches saw this suggested grouping was literally about minutes ago <e> <s> will he therefore take it for granted that in allowing the motion to pass we must reserve our right to look at the proposed grouping to see whether it is suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl remember as he should do the debates that took place in this house on the earlier bill and the amendments that were moved by the opposition and from the bishops benches <e> <s> is he encouraged by his recollection of those events not to make remarks such as he has just made and to bring forward sensible legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who hopes that he has a young and agile mind perhaps i may be permitted to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for drawing attention to the extremely original thought of mine that sometimes a fact can be shown by evidence not to be a fact <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that for once the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is wrong even if for once he agrees with the noble lord lord denham <e> <s> as i understand the situation my noble friend was called upon to rise in order to deal with the whole of the matters which began with the paving <e>", "<cs> my lords it is correctly said that lawyers perhaps try to take the monopoly of wisdom and discussion in your lordships house when matters of this kind are being discussed <e> <s> it is wrong for the house to think that that is so <e> <s> the issues here are important for every one of our citizens <e> <s> it would be an insult to suggest that your lordships could not readily grasp the issues involved <e> <s> they are very simple <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to underline any adjectives that are complimentary of the noble earl <e> <s> i do not quite follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in admiring what has happened by way of amendment as a result of the discussion but that is a side issue <e> <s> we all admire the way in which the noble earl has dealt with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would also like to refer to the procedure which was adopted so helpfully by the noble earl following upon our proceedings in committee <e> <s> he was good enough to write to all those who participated in the debate and was kind enough to suggest the very wording of this amendment <e> <s> we are deeply grateful to him for having done so <e> <s> that allowed us to put forward an amendment which has met with the agreement of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the fact that something was drawn in a somewhat mysterious ambiguous and devious way in ought to give us a far better parliament than the one which operated at that time an opportunity of correcting the language <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a famous english institution which has as a motto as i recollect i mean well <e> <s> i would wish that that motto be applied to the noble lord lord elton this afternoon <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that the purpose that he has is a worthy one namely the speeding up of justice the saving of money to the treasury and also economising on the legal aid fund <e> <s> but before one speeds up justice one has to be sure that justice itself is going to be granted <e> <s> looking at matters first of all objectively and then from the point of view of the defendant may i quickly summarise the reasons why we on these benches would oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he kindly remind me of any sentence that i uttered which made this a party issue <e> <s> does he remember that the noble baroness lady phillips rose in the course of this debate and very resolutely as is her way opposed everything that i had said <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened with great attention and care to what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> what he said followed a speech from the noble and learned lord lord ackner to which we also gave great attention <e> <s> as i understand it that speech ended with a suggestion with some urgency behind it that the law commission should immediately examine the very difficult field to which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor referred and to which the noble and learned lord lord ackner and others referred in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords that course is open to the mover of the amendment at this stage as i am advised by moving the amendment with the omission of the last three lines should he so wish <e> <s> i mention that not as a recommendation but as an indication of what i am advised is the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the opposition let me say at once that we support this amendment as the noble lord lord donaldson indicated <e> <s> possibly the power of our support may be measured by the brevity of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it is distressing that at this hour and in a not too crowded house a matter of such importance is being discussed <e> <s> because of the lateness of the hour all i shall say is that i have listened attentively to the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> from these benches i wish to support what he has said and i re-echo the words that he used in regard to the anxiety of members of the law society as to the position in which they are continually being put as a result of these matters the hardship that it entails and the injustice very often that is entailed too <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to make two points and that quickly <e> <s> the first point i would make is that i would disagree with the noble lord lord harris fundamentally if the view were taken as a result of his speech that parliament either in this house or in the other place has ever taken a lenient view of drunken driving <e> <s> in my judgment whenever there has been a discussion in your lordships house or elsewhere people have risen from all sides of the house to condemn it to point out its dangers and to say that people who do it are criminal <e>", "<cs> my lords relatively happy is the right term and i readily thank the noble earl for his courtesy in the way he has dealt with this amendment which was originally moved as he rightly said by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> we look forward to the possibility of the governments amendment being available by third reading but if that is not so the undertaking is perfectly satisfactory and i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> i beg leave to withdrawn the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i always pay tribute to the manner in which the noble lord answers questions if not always to the content of the answers <e> <s> is he prepared to indicate strongly to the director general that unless the guidelines are obeyed the government will consider legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that members of both houses of parliament representing as they do in the lower house the people of this country and in this house the wisdom of this country <e>", "<cs> could make a contribution that is invaluable and that in any event ought to be their right as public representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and i shall not weary the house by jumping up again until i reply to this debate i should like to say that he has completely misunderstood me <e> <s> i merely referred to the notice that he now gets under the bill <e> <s> i was not vilifying any amendment which had previously been made when i said that the notice at the moment is a bland notice <e> <s> the noble lord is right to think that there is a right of reply but before one replies to something one has to know what one is answering <e>", "<cs> my lords i at once express my appreciation to the noble and learned lord for the distance that he has travelled towards those who moved the amendment <e> <s> i was possibly too optimistic when i thought he would travel the whole distance and say that as the spirit of the amendment is one that commends itself to him the amendment could be accepted obviously with the proviso that wording which he deemed to be wiser and more apt would find its way into the bill as it travelled its normal passage <e>", "<cs> my lords then i shall try if i may only for the clarification of my mind if no one elses to spell out what i understand the undertaking to be <e> <s> incidentally i express my gratitude to all the noble and learned lords who spoke even the one who spoke against me <e> <s> i give him the title of learned because his utterances seem that way even though i could not accept them as such <e> <s> as i understand it the undertaking is that it is realised that the whole basis of the notice to the respondent to that notice the accused person if i may call him that has to spell out the case against him both in fact and in law <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily accept the spirit in which that undertaking and the explanation of it were given and ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder and i say this with all due humility whether we are not making unnecessary problems for a very just solution <e> <s> your lordships seem to be in general agreement that in the ordinary run of cases reasons should be given before we rob a fellow citizen or even a stranger in our land of his freedom and as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich was saying a moment ago quite correctly possibly subject him to some two years imprisonment before he even gets his trial <e> <s> we all know that that kind of condition exists in some places <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect i wonder whether the noble and learned lord is right <e> <s> even if he is right and i am wrong obviously it should not be difficult to cover the security point without throwing out what is a very necessary amendment <e> <s> the greater evil in my submission is not the security risk it is that we shall be leaving the secretary of state in a position where he need give no reason at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i observe that amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped together <e> <s> therefore a short speech may be opportune to deal with the general matters raised by the noble lord lord hutchinson and also with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am disappointed with the observations of the noble earl and i do not believe that i shall be alone in this chamber in my disappointment <e> <s> this is an opportunity for the prevention of crime and therefore in my judgment it comes well within the purview of criminal legislation <e> <s> i had hoped that if one was able to define an offensive weapon to make it an offence under the bill one could define an imitation of an offensive weapon in precisely the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not some recent notable events in regard to international drug trafficking which have resulted directly from the international co-operation of which the noble earl has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate about a subject which possibly can be summed up by the law society maxim there is no justice without legal aid i hope in a short winding up speech to be able to imitate the temerity and the deference of the noble and learned lord lord ackner in what i thought was a most notable speech <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble and learned lord would with his usual kindness indicate whether or not it was the intention to go out for tender in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords it is pleasant even at a late hour and when ones words are not going into very many ears to pay two compliments <e> <s> the first compliment i should like to pay with every sincerity is to the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> i want to thank him for his continuing courtesy to me as his opposite number on these benches <e> <s> i also want to pay tribute to a minister whose industry was quite indefatigable who learnt a lot at firsthand about the prisoners and the prisons under his administration and who tried within the limitations imposed upon him by the government to do his best <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will help the noble earl lord longford who on wednesday is putting before the house a very useful motion on the press and how they should behave <e> <s> if the noble earl opposite will attend in his new capacity and participate in that debate i am sure the noble earl will be most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl whom we all congratulate on his new appointment agree that when in his former capacity he dealt with the drinking legislation applying to football grounds closed circuit television proved very beneficial <e> <s> in that latter connection will he confirm that some units have been supplied throughout the country and that the police are at present engaged in carrying out further technological investigation into improved closed circuit television <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank my noble friend lord longford on your lordships behalf for introducing this debate on very interesting matters <e> <s> he is to be thanked if only because he brought into the debate the worthy maiden speech of the noble lord lord deedes which we also much enjoyed <e> <s> if i may say so he was also responsible for the speech of my noble friend lord ardwick which we enjoyed very much indeed too <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the words used were within the law <e> <s> obviously if the law were to be imposed here by parliament i speak in the context of the official secrets act and it had the effect of limiting the freedom of the press in any statutory form i believe that we would be doing wrong <e> <s> but we must ensure that the curbs which are very often voluntarily accepted in industries be they the tobacco industry or other industries are imposed upon sections of the media such as the press <e> <s> if i may say so the press has at the same time got a complaint <e> <s> the complaint is not that it is being made a mockery of in regard to certain freedoms but that the courts are now being made a mockery of <e> <s> i say that with sadness <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl continues i hope that he will deal with the suggestions as to how the four recommendations of the royal commission could be observed <e> <s> will he make clear the fact that the principles to which he has referred in the booklet refer only to past decisions and not to a code for journalists <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is always very courteous and i intervene only to make my position quite clear <e> <s> i did not in any part of my speech suggest that there should be a statutory protection of privacy <e> <s> i was again talking about the code of conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first instance perhaps i may congratulate the noble earl on his new ministry and say that it is a great joy to see him return to the dispatch box to which in the past he lent great distinction <e> <s> i should like to ask him this question arising out of the discussion that we have just had <e> <s> in spite of his answer is he aware that there is a general feeling that there is still too much of a bureaucratic attitude shown by immigration officers and even their medical advisers <e> <s> at the start of what i am sure will be a very distinctive ministry at the home office will <e>", "<cs> a mist has descended on the committee and it has hidden the sunshine that the noble baroness and my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones brought into it <e> <s> the sunshine was that in spite of the fact that this is an enabling bill at second reading the count of regulations made under it was i believe over <e> <s> however if we leave this as an enabling bill without giving the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor present and future certain clear duties and i do not baulk at the words we shall be missing an opportunity which will not return and we shall be walking into risks in the future which i do not believe any one noble lord would wish to contemplate <e>", "<cs> i regret that the noble and learned lord has again stopped short in his reading of this amendment <e> <s> i say that with the deepest possible respect <e> <s> he stopped short of words which are very material and which i was about to read to the committee <e> <s> the words are not the provision of legal advice for people who otherwise would not be able to afford it <e> <s> he is under a duty to secure the provision of a scheme <e> <s> that is the first thing not a duty to provide legal advice <e> <s> then come the words which defeat the arguments of both noble and learned lords though at least the noble and learned lord lord denning said he had the utmost sympathy with the object behind this amendment <e> <s> i was very glad to hear it and for that sympathy i am duly grateful <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble and learned lord will forgive me and will not think this an impertinent intervention <e> <s> the amendment says as defined below <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will look at the definition clause he will see that clause says <e>", "<cs> i have some difficulty with the very kind words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> he paid tribute to the experience and what has been done for the nation <e> <s> i am sure that the law society which has heard that expression of appreciation from him before and was very grateful for it will be grateful for it now <e> <s> i only hope that that experience and that appreciation will be remembered over the years <e> <s> it is experience accumulated over years <e> <s> i feel therefore if i may say so respectfully to the noble and learned lord that to have a fixture if i may put it that way of at least three which is not very many but which will give that experience over the years would be guidance for his successors he needs no guidance himself <e> <s> otherwise i would have been completely content with the noble and learned lords assurance that he would be looking at a figure similar to three or possibly more dependent on how he finds his experience with the rest of the board <e> <s> i should be content with that verbal assurance <e>", "<cs> there are so many important amendments and matters of principle coming before this committee that i do not believe that i should take up time at this stage in testing the feeling of the committee or taking the matter further <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment with liberty to apply at further stages of the bill if i see fit <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are all grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for what he said and especially for his assurance that in each and every case we shall be looking to see whether the negative or the positive procedure will be appropriate <e> <s> in addition we shall be looking at things on their merits <e> <s> in view of the kind assurance from the noble and learned lord that there will be an amendment at report stage which will deal with this matter in the way that he said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the words of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i say this for the first time in the course of the committee proceedings and i say it to my great regret will be received with great sorrow throughout the country certainly so far as those who are connected with advice centres and citizens advice bureaux are concerned <e> <s> they reflect and i am choosing my words advisedly a lack of appreciation of what happens on the ground <e> <s> what happens on the ground is that the citizen goes to the citizens advice bureau or the legal advice centre <e> <s> this is done almost every single day throughout the country and in all appropriate cases there is complete liaison with local solicitors they work in close co-operation <e> <s> one without the other would impose upon the legal aid fund an absolutely insuperable financial burden <e> <s> the advice centres and the citizens advice bureaux are looking to parliament at this moment to see that the white paper words that i used and quoted are not wasted or meaningless words <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord and readily agree to what he has suggested <e> <s> i hope i am not over-burdening the noble and learned lords department but it would be of considerable assistance if one had an intimation before report stage that the amendment as it stands is acceptable or of any suggested amendment <e> <s> if it is acceptable then it could be tabled at report stage so that this point is covered <e> <s> subject to those remarks i readily accept what the noble and learned lord has said and i regard it as very helpful <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord for much of what he has said <e> <s> i should like to have the opportunity of consulting and to study what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> at this stage i would ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is always so courteous to others that i should like to reciprocate that courtesy and i shall certainly do so <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must at least answer in view of the nature of the objections that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the noble lord lord renton raised <e> <s> i was going to say but the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said it rather better than i could that emphasis has been placed upon the fact that membership of the board does not mean representation of the interests of the people concerned <e> <s> one hopes as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said that this will operate as a unit for the general benefit of mankind if i may put it that way <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is amazed at that remark and finds it a matter for some jollification but i assure him that that really is the attitude of my profession <e> <s> i am sure that he can speak for his profession <e> <s> i say that with some seriousness because quite obviously what may be deemed to be very favourable to the profession would be seen by it to be too favourable if another aspect is being ignored and is being sacrificed by virtue of the benefit which is being offered <e> <s> that may be a matter that quite obviously should be discussed and be the subject of consultation whether it be favourable or unfavourable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that from time to time we have questions asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter which appear to have as their aim the chipping away of the reputation of the parole system <e> <s> if that is so does the noble earl agree that it is rather damaging to take a minority of cases and then try to construct a general application which is harmful to the reputation of the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that the concern he has expressed is widespread throughout the nation and is appreciated in all quarters of the house <e> <s> is he further aware that my only concern was that examples in a few cases should not lead the government or anyone else to think that the parole board is not carrying out a very difficult task very well indeed accompanying mercy with justice <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i should have referred to legal aid and advice <e> <s> these second third and fourth exceptions which i read out the conveyance consequent upon a property order the will consequent upon a property order or on the severing of a joint tenancy these mainly relate to the breakdown of a relationship <e> <s> there will be some cases where these steps can be taken under a full legal aid certificate for ancillary proceedings <e> <s> in other cases a certificate may be <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may rise before both the noble lords sit down <e>", "<cs> i believe it is only fair to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that i should try to answer those points before he addresses the committee <e> <s> i should love to leave this to the affirmative resolution procedure but the committee will appreciate that there is no opportunity to amend when regulations come forward under that procedure <e> <s> it is possible to list a whole host of things which cannot be amended either they are thrown out or they are approved <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not testing the patience and courtesy of the committee in rising again <e> <s> i do so merely to try to correct a misapprehension <e> <s> i am not bound nobody is bound by the groupings that appear on a piece of paper except that by tradition we try to observe them <e> <s> i have only just seen them <e> <s> no doubt that is my fault but i expressly said at the opening of my remarks that i was also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> as always the noble and learned lord has been both courteous and lucid but i know that he will forgive me if i say with deep respect that i do not think that he has been convincing <e> <s> i say this to the committee for this reason we are walking into dangerous parliamentary chapters in the history of legislation when we keep on saying do not expect this in primary legislation <e> <s> we are thinking the thing over <e> <s> we want to be flexible <e> <s> minds might change <e> <s> do it all by regulation <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down let me say that of course i accept that the government will in courtesy listen to any submission made orally to a civil servant any letter that may be read to a minister or indeed any speech made in this house <e> <s> but parliament is not supreme in these matters <e> <s> it is at the discretion of the government whether or not they take account of speeches made in a debate and parliament is supposed to be the body that legislates <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may follow the noble and learned lord into the pathways that he if i may say so correctly entered <e> <s> this a matter for my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones to deal with since it is his amendment <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord is putting to the committee that one should look at the effect on the bill as a whole of whether one has an affirmative or a negative resolution i would respectfully have said that that <e>", "<cs> with drawn face and with perspiration literally running from my forehead and in some state of absolute confusion and ill health i answer the tirade of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> he quoted hamlet <e> <s> i thought that i was listening to a very vocal ghost as he was talking because i cannot recognise either the state of health in which i was supposed to be or the things that i was supposed to have said on a previous bill <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> a later provision in the bill refers to the law society and the bar council being consulted on matters of remuneration <e> <s> everyone is trying to make me ill today <e> <s> if i were not in a state of good health i suppose i should not be able to resist this <e>", "<cs> if i may say with respect to the noble and learned lord i believe that he has failed to understand for very good reason the purpose of this amendment and what really happens on the ground <e> <s> i assure the noble and learned lord that it would be an odd eccentric who wandered into a law centre being possessed of funds in order to obtain advice <e> <s> it may happen but it is in the minority of cases <e> <s> the average person who turns up at the law centre is usually poor very often lacking in education and fearful of walking into a solicitors office and fearful of facing a means test <e> <s> if there were to be some sort of means test that the law centre had to advertise and administer then one can take it for granted on the experience of law centres i am told this by many who run them now and as i used to do it in days gone by i can well understand that that is the experience that if those people thought they would have questions addressed to them through some sort of means test they would keep away <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation of his views in regard to this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether he could assist me in this way <e> <s> in view of the fact that this was last looked at in november and we are now over four years in advance of that could he at least say that it is the intention of his department to review these matters annually <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there be a promise of an increase in remuneration annually but i am asking whether it is the intention of his department to review the remuneration annually <e>", "<cs> i have done my duty at the behest of the law society and obviously the law society will consider what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i in turn shall consider what they have to say to me <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise only to ensure that the discussion is complete if i may put it that way <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning cited cases where quite obviously there was no remedy at all to the other party once the legal aid certificate had been granted and even before <e> <s> as i understand it there will be a provision under this bill or some regulation under which a party against whom a legal aid certificate has been granted will have the right to go to the board and give reason as to why that certificate should not be granted <e> <s> that is a very real safeguard against the case without merit <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister claim to have any knowledge of human affairs when he announces to the nation that it is the likely conduct of somebody who is about to die to walk out and try to find an expensive house <e>", "<cs> my lords in dealing with matters that are not covered by nuclear war or the threat of it is the noble earl satisfied that sufficient resources are being placed at the disposal of local authorities so that they can deal with the type of emergency that the noble lord lord renton was speaking of <e>", "<cs> it meets the difficulty in this way <e> <s> if the class action were brought and the state funded it the same results as pertain in the present action would not have to be a burden on the legal aid fund in that one would not be choosing the person who was the poorest and who would make no contribution <e> <s> in a class action one would be seeing to it that the whole of the damages awarded if the case were successful would be paid and the costs therefore of all of the parties would be attributable to the gross sum of the damages <e> <s> if one takes the single case which is what the master of the rolls was bringing to parliaments attention one does not do that <e> <s> the single plaintiff is awarded a single sum by way of damages and it is against the whole of that award of damages that the cost would be chargeable <e> <s> in the class action the whole of the class would bring the action the whole of the damages would be awarded on that basis and the charge would be on a very large sum indeed <e>", "<cs> if the last sentence which the noble and learned lord uttered were to be correct and i could see the force of it i should not be wearying the committee with a reply but i am afraid that i cannot accept what he has said <e> <s> going backwards over the noble and learned lords remarks i wish to say with all humility as i do not in any way pretend even to be an expert upon english law and procedure let alone upon american law and procedure that at the present moment i do happen to have precisely the problem with the class action that the noble and learned lord mentioned <e> <s> one can always withdraw from a class action in the united states i am advised by agreement with the defendants if one is a plaintiff or otherwise by leave of the court <e> <s> i throw that point out for what it is worth because it entails no disadvantage at all <e> <s> precisely the same situation might well apply in our courts except of course that one can always serve notice of discontinuance of proceedings with the resultant effect on costs which is not necessarily applicable in the united states <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble and learned lord with deep respect <e> <s> i know that he always listens to all members of the committee with great courtesy <e> <s> i promise him that i shall deal with that very point i had not reached it yet <e> <s> he will find when i reach that point that i come in a not entirely white sheet <e> <s> i shall admit that <e>", "<cs> thank goodness there are differences <e> <s> i am sure that america has advantages over us in some respects and that we have advantages over america in others <e> <s> however i am dealing with english law and procedure <e> <s> the committee should not be put off the trail by a reference to contingency fees which do not apply as the noble and learned lord well knows <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord makes an intervention which is extremely useful and which is meant to be helpful <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> that argument is unanswerable <e> <s> however i do not come before the committee in a white sheet on this point <e> <s> obviously the question of the charge must follow the logic of the case for the amendment <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that if had done a thorough job with those who are very concerned within the profession that the amendment should be passed i would have added a provision as i meant to do in the argument which i am advancing to the committee that when such legal aid is granted the legally assisted person in whose name the class action is being conducted should not he subject to the legal aid charge in respect of costs incurred by him for the class action <e> <s> that was part of my brief and i disclose that brief to the committee <e> <s> i concede at once that the noble lords who pointed that out to me with great courtesy are absolutely right <e>", "<cs> i have received a reminder which removes all the spots from the white gown that i am supposed to wear when i appear before the committee <e> <s> i am reminded that my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i take the liberty of reading it even though it has not been reached <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> if there is a nil contribution i agree that it does not automatically refer to the charge <e> <s> in regard to that i say to the committee only that i was reminded of amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> it deals with the question of the contribution not the charge <e> <s> as i said before i admit that in my brief as it should have been there would be reference to the charge not being applicable to a case where the board admitted under its discretion a class or representative action to come within the suggested amendment <e> <s> i ask for the principle to be looked at on that basis <e> <s> if the principle <e>", "<cs> i referred to regulation <e> <s> that regulation stipulates that the contribution payable out of income is to be paid over a period of not more than months <e> <s> why alter that <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment my worst fears have been realised <e> <s> i say that with a sense of complete seriousness <e> <s> paraphrasing the noble and learned lord i hope he thinks fairly he concluded his remarks by saying that he did not see any sense at all in a stipulation which limited the period to months <e> <s> perhaps he will be good enough to explain why in the government saw fit to pass such a regulation limiting the period to months <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord will tell the committee not only why that was done but also what instances have occurred since then which made the provision a completely wrong provision in his view <e>", "<cs> i intervene only for one moment as my own profession has also been mentioned <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord lord griffiths said was absolutely correct <e> <s> the committee must forgive me for repeating a phrase that i used before but if one looks at what is happening on the ground i would say to the noble and learned lord lord denning whose altruism i shall always respect that the situation became very different once legal aid was created <e>", "<cs> i accept that at once <e> <s> unless there is any misunderstanding let me make it perfectly clear that i was not saying that idealism had died in the profession <e> <s> of course it has not and of course there are many volunteers at legal aid centres advice centres law centres and other such places <e> <s> however if we are tackling the real problem i make the point that either one is saying that legal aid is a charity and people who take it on are doing so charitably or one pays a fair remuneration for the work which is what this amendment is trying to establish <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord will realise that as the bill now stands there need not be any regulations for an appeal to lie in any case at all <e> <s> therefore with great respect what he has said does not apply <e> <s> if there are regulations which shall be made they will permit an appeal and lay down the procedure and there could be an exception to the rule in the kind of case about which the noble and learned lord speaks <e> <s> however at the moment there is no obligation to have any regulations at all providing for an appeal <e>", "<cs> as do all members of the committee i wish the noble and learned lord an extremely long tenure in his office and an extremely long and healthy life <e> <s> however the fact that at this moment he says that he intends to make certain regulations is surely not a way of dealing with legislation when we all know that the regulations ought to be made <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord wishes me to withdraw the amendment i appeal to him to say that he will at least consider adding words which make it mandatory he cannot lose anything if he intends to do so that such regulations will be made to provide for an appeal even though not applying to every case <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord says that he will consider that point i shall take a certain course <e>", "<cs> if nothing is added and nothing is subtracted presumably no harm is done <e> <s> in view of what the noble and learned lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that the noble and learned lord might go even further <e> <s> however we have to be grateful for whatever comes forward from the rich table so honourably decorated by him <e> <s> with that undertaking i suppose that we on this side of the committee must rest content <e> <s> given that assurance and the promise that the matter will be looked at again before the next stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware that sometimes leakages occur not from civil servants but from ministers <e> <s> is he therefore prepared to put the same barrier in the way of ministers who continually leak information as that imposed on civil servants <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord lord irvine of lairg and i put down amendments nos <e> <s> d and e <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has

"<cs> my lords is one of the matters which will appeal to the noble earl as worthy of consideration the views of other unions to which exactly the same grades now belong <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been made abundantly clear by my noble and learned friend and the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has paid tribute to it that no one in this house as far as i know would ever want to cast aspersions on the integrity of the attorney-general or the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> that is not in issue <e>", "<cs> my lords in this interesting and very useful debate your lordships

announced by the chief whip <e> <s> it would not be charitable if i for one took advantage of that and i do not intend to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen may well he right and i

expertise from a dictionary may be a sign of some fallibility in the dictionary and not of the draftsman <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble and learned lord will accept this as a respectful remark but i am disappointed as are my noble friends with his reply <e> <s> this an important way indeed a vital way of ensuring the standards of those services which are being contracted out <e> <s>

not think me in the slightest degree rude if i limit the adjective to the word polite <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to emphasise one aspect possibly lost sight of during what the house may feel has been an argument on words <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord hailsham to whom we always listen with delight sometimes also with approval said that he could not see the difference between the words fair and reasonable <e> <s> much of the time of the house was taken in listening with enjoyment to that part of his speech on semantics <e> <s> i would most respectfully say to the noble and learned lord that although i thought his speech was fair in that not one remark was aimed below the solar plexus i did not think it was reasonable <e> <s> therefore from my remarks he may possibly detect that there is a slight difference between the meaning of those words <e>", "<cs> my lords so be it <e> <s> i should have thought that there was also some slight differentiation in this context <e> <s> however i hope that the house will not be misled into thinking about words and will return to thinking about principles <e> <s> it is in that connection that i said that i wanted to emphasise something <e> <s> the one result that the house would not want to see as a consequence of the bills passage is two classes of lawyers first the good and experienced ones who receive the type of fee mentioned in subsection a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i apologise to him for my seeming lack of courtesy in not referring to the fact that it was he who moved the amendment at committee stage <e> <s> i had forgotten that <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to any observations while i am still on my feet that the noble and learned lord lord ackner may care to make

for this reason <e> <s> the wording of paragraph d seems to me to mean that the lord chancellor when fixing remuneration will consider the number and general level of competence of barristers and solicitors who are undertaking the work for legal aid <e> <s> that is a very different matter from the amendment which i had the privilege of moving copying as i have now made it clear with an apology

courtesy in answering my argument <e> <s> i hope that he will forgive me for saying that i am not in the slightest degree convinced by it <e> <s> it would be a perfect argument if we were starting a legal aid scheme in <e> <s> it would then be right that one would look ahead see the number of people who are competent to do the work and then fix a fee for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and i promise not to ask for the leave of the house again in regard to this matter will the noble and learned lord show some little flexibility in this matter <e> <s> i say that most respectfully <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord ackner and i have endeavoured to say what we mean by the amendment and why we consider that the existing words do not carry out the purpose of the amendment in looking to the future <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will say that if there is doubt about the words he will make the matter clear within the spirit of our amendment and also look at the argument which the present words do not address i personally would be satisfied and we can reconsider the matter at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords in the expectation of that open mind <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the last words of the noble and learned lord echoed through the chamber and certainly struck my ears <e> <s> however i assure

open mind and if i may say so with respect very seriously indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will forgive me i talked in terms of dignity in regard to an application for judicial review <e> <s> i know that he will understand that i was not thinking of the court acting as an arbitrator which quite obviously is a most dignified role <e> <s> i was thinking of an argument as to whether the lord chancellor of this country has adopted the procedures that he should have followed in taking certain decisions under an act of parliament <e> <s> if that is dignity i do not know what dignity means <e>", "<cs> my lords only for the sake of clarity and not out of any intelligence of ingenuity i happen to have taken advice <e> <s> so that we know at least how our proceedings ought to be dealt with perhaps i may say that the convention appears to be that after the minister has spoken in answer for the government the mover of any amendment thereupon speaks <e>

that it was more than <e> <s> we decided or some of us decided that that was possibly not the best way of dealing with primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem arises where legislation refers to regulations without parliament whether it is the commons of your lordships house really knowing the nature of those <e>", "<cs> my lords at one stage i thought it was a predetermined tactic to talk out my amendment and that was not the purpose with which i moved it <e> <s> having said that i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and the noble lord lord renton for supporting the amendment <e> <s> nothing in the world will convince me that in an act of parliament such as this there should be the provision that the lord chancellor cannot determine the way in which money is to be distributed and so forth without the approval of the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords having been given some hope that a smile will be on the faces of certain of your lordships who will be trying to improve this bill on third reading i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to show the flexibility of at least one side of the house we have no objection to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is considerable concern as the noble lord lord harris said about the amount of laundering of this very undesirable money <e> <s> will the noble earl encourage the bank of england to have specific talks with its opposite numbers in jersey i believe they are known as the offshore banking supervisors in order to see whether practical steps can be taken immediately even prior to legislation to ensure that this dreadful traffic is not made profitable in offshore places that at least are contiguous to our own territory <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not some cases of which the minister is aware where especially old people or those suffering from some illness are very upset at receiving demands which are very often in excess of what they should be <e> <s> in those cases would it not be meritorious for the assessment to be sent to the professional representative so that the taxpayer is not worried <e>", "<cs> my lords a year ago i had the privilege to wind up for the official opposition in the debate that was then initiated by my noble friend lord jenkins of putney on the self same issue of secret services and their accountability <e> <s> i thanked him then for bringing a matter of national importance before your lordships house and i thank him once again for doing so <e>",

i did ask another question <e> <s> if the noble earl is unable to deal with it i shall well understand because i gave him no notice <e> <s> the question was whether it had been made abundantly clear to the security staff that they would suffer no harm whatever should they register complaints and that the procedure was a perfectly easy one <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone respects an amendment moved by the noble lord lord coleraine but i hope that on this occasion the house will not accept it <e> <s> he gave two reasons and i shall deal with them briefly as to why copy leases should be supplied to the public <e> <s> the first is the case of a flat in a building where one wants to know where the boundaries are <e> <s> i have not in practice encountered a difficulty that is in any way a substantial one with regard to such a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology and i do not think that the house would expect one for asking the house to give the gravest possible consideration to the annual renewal and continuance of the legislation asked for by the order before your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister who is extremely courteous but is also extremely able in debate remembers what is in fact the complaint <e> <s> the complaint was not that the order was coming before the house at this moment but was about the announcement that temporary legislation was to be replaced by permanent legislation <e> <s> in case he believes that i am peculiarly unkind from this front bench which of course is quite inaccurate i refer him to todays article on the front page of <e>", "<cs> my lords a second and i hope a final intervention which the noble earl has so politely allowed me to make he knows as well as i do that there is a convention that the opposition do not oppose orders that are brought in this way <e> <s> if that were not the convention i might with some of my noble friends have had to take a certain course tonight <e> <s> i do not want our attitude to be misunderstood <e> <s> we are obeying the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords as no amendments have been tabled i think that this is an appropriate time to make a few remarks before we reach the stage of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the terrible facts of this case as disclosed at this inquest <e> <s> is he aware that here was a man of years of age charged with setting fire to a derelict building who was found dead with a sheet around his neck that he was in police custody for days during which time he was moved times once as far as walsall in the midlands that he never had a full medical examination although one doctor suspected schizophrenia that he had five days at marylebone police station in a cell measuring eight feet by four feet which was too narrow for him to stretch his arms that he had no bed and that he was not allowed out for exercise <e> <s> is the minister aware that this constitutes a bigger crime by the state against this man than the man would have committed if he had been convicted of the crime for which he was charged <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister detect the feeling of absolute horror throughout this house at the facts of which i informed the house and which the minister has in no way contradicted <e> <s> will he accept that our government are expected to be a civilised government and the conditions in police cells as i described to the house are not fit for any remand prisoner <e> <s> will he therefore as a matter of urgency ask his right honourable friend to see that conditions are made available for remand prisoners other than those that i outlined to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to detect some amount of opposition to the amendment that i moved <e> <s> whether that opposition is due to extreme sensitivity or not i am not sure <e> <s> however because i regard it as being very important i should like to say at once that i do intend at the end of what i have to say to test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords my response should be courteous and short <e> <s> i respect the view put to the house by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it has not affected my view that for the reasons that i have given the amendment should be put to the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords if i may say so this all seems very sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords my only respectful quarrel with the noble and learned lord is that he has paraphrased precatory words into making them mandatory <e> <s> i prayed him not to inquire further into this matter and so delay some kind of remedy <e> <s> i would never do anything else other than that <e> <s> certainly in the light of the century which he scored against me by way of a majority on the last amendment it is necessary for me to be extra humble <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down and with the permission of the house he has perfectly fairly expressed the view that i put to the house that it would be desirable subject to what i said that this amendment should be agreed to <e> <s> i know he will forgive me if i say that he did not quite interpret my proper views possibly because i did not express them as i should have done when i talked about difficulties which would confront the legal aid board which would be more appropriately dealt with by a court <e> <s> i was dealing with a separation of issues seeing whether there were common issues and giving certain directions which quite obviously <e>", "<cs> my lords anything that we on this side of the house can do to punish in justice those who indulge in the evil trade of drug trafficking will be done and the government are assured of that <e> <s> the order sensibly means that cross-border orders can be made effective in regard to the confiscation of the ill-gotten gains made in this dreadful trade <e> <s> it is a sensible order <e> <s> we also commend it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that my grandchildren have been insisting that i was wearing facial additions in aid of comic relief when in fact i was not <e> <s> on a more serious point is it not the case that criticism should not attach to the conduct of comic relief by virtue not only of the fact that as the noble earl said all its profits are covenanted in favour of charity projects ltd which is a registered charity but also because no charges are made for fund-raising which again is an example that other charities might well follow <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister knows that he has the respect and affection of all parts of your lordships house <e> <s> however the only tribute that i can pay him on this occasion is that of mental ability and intellectual clarity in moving the second reading of a bill which is without a heart and without a soul <e> <s> i say that advisedly <e> <s> i hope that all sections of your lordships house at the later stages of this bill will see that it is at least suitably amended <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always gracious in giving way <e> <s> i thought i made it abundantly clear so that political points of that kind could not be made that of course we realise that immigration control was necessary <e> <s> i dealt specifically with the social issues involved in the provisions of this bill <e> <s> no example was given by the minister of where things were going wrong and therefore had to be put right <e>", "<cs> we were reflecting on the last statements which were made <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way for one moment <e> <s> he was fair enough to quote a possible example of a mother dying <e> <s> is he really saying that in these circumstances there would be no appeal against a deportation order on the grounds of mercy when a civil servant had issued the deportation order after the last appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords because of our respective duties i think that i am right to say that the noble earl and i are still fasting and therefore as a matter of mutual consideration i propose to be extremely brief <e> <s> i can be brief because the noble lord lord harris has outlined the facts of three dreadful cases the first of which i brought to the attention of the house last week immediately i had heard of certain facts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point which is obviously a poignant one and one which is central to the whole matter perhaps i may say that the cell was described as being feet by feet it did not allow the prisoner to stretch his arms there was no room for a bed and there was no bed <e> <s> when the noble earl speaking on behalf of the home office says temporary what does he mean <e> <s> does he mean that it is suitable for anyone in these conditions to remain there for more than a matter of a few hours <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his manner of answering questions in this house is most acceptable <e> <s> in order that the position is made abundantly clear will he also confirm that there are two entities at that address one of which does not purport to be a registered charity <e> <s> is he also aware that since this charity was created in no complaint of any kind was made between and or until very recently and that was quite obviously a politically inspired complaint <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient since the hour has just struck seven for a certain decision to be taken which was announced for seven oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for guiding us through these esoteric provisions with his usual clarity of language and customary lucidity <e> <s> there are a few matters which deserve comment when an important bill of this kind comes before the house <e> <s> after all it affects the lives and futures of many people within the united kingdom and outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords in his amusing and very erudite discussion would the noble and learned lord care to mention the logic of why someone who ought to be subject to english law can go over the border and can then be subject to scots law <e>

from the act which we are meant to be dealing with today <e> <s> i say in all solemnity that the house should be reminded of the section of the act passed years ago i repeat that the bill comes before the house on the eve of the budget <e> <s> i refer to section v of the crown lands act <e> <s> i say with a slight smile that your lordships ought to be reminded of the relevance of that section to the present occasion <e> <s> section v reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for three things first for having introduced into your lordships chamber a most valuable debate secondly for having given the house the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will forgive me <e> <s> i am sure that that is absolutely right

minister <e> <s> in other words are they so informed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that he has the full support of members on the opposition benches in regard to the clause that he mentioned <e> <s> indeed it was with pleasure that we agreed to this clause being added in the commons even though it did not appear in the bill here in the lords despite an undertaking to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that he is the greatest optimist in this house <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones with his customary modesty said that this was a complex bill <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers who has that quality in common with my noble and learned friend assented <e> <s> that does not mean that this is a complicated amendment <e> <s>

parliament prepared and is this place prepared as at this moment if the amendment is defeated to dictate a matter of social policy in our country which i believe to be highly undesirable <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble earl will forgive me as he always does and allow me to intervene because he is very courteous <e> <s> however if we were debating whether the clause should stand part the noble earl knows as well as i do and he is always fair that the argument which he would address to the committee would be that the clause cannot stand part because we should be in breach of the european court of human rights <e> <s> if the clause is to remain we should be in breach of that judgment <e> <s> that is exactly why i am trying to say to the committee that we should be upholding that judgment and altering the word wives to spouses <e> <s> we cannot do anything else <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lord lord renton is making a very valid point as is not unusual <e> <s> i am taking it for granted in the wording that it is not only a right but a right which is exercised <e> <s> i think the noble lord has in mind a rather peculiar position <e> <s> that the parents have the right of abode and they make the application is one case <e> <s> if the parents have the right of abode and so not make the application but the children claim the right even though the claim has not been made that would be a very odd situation <e> <s> perhaps i may have to alter this at report stage to make the principle quite clear <e> <s> where there is the right of abode and the parents endeavour to use that right to get the children over here is the case i have in mind <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down in reading subsection he left out though certainly not on purpose the following words which occur in brackets in subection <e>", "<cs> with all due respect i do not think that the noble earl would wish to leave this amendment in a purely negative way <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate has said we are dealing with those people who were previously covered by section of the act <e> <s> in spite of assurances and undertakings and their decision to put this issue in statutory form the government decided that that provision should be repealed <e> <s> the repeal means that those who were settled as defined in theact will no longer have the benefit of that subsection <e> <s> i am trying to save the children from being subject to that repeal and that is all that the amendment asks <e>", "<cs> i believe that members of the commitee will not think me unreasonable in trying to clarify the situation <e> <s> one is perfectly prepared to try to rescue even a part of the amendment to ensure that positive action is taken <e> <s> the amendment seeks to provide that those who were permitted entry under section of the act shall still be permitted entry if their parents apply for that and if they are entitled but for this repeal to have the children here <e> <s> i am prepared to limit the children to those who are under the age of when the application is made <e> <s> i am trying to be as reasonable as possible in order to save something from the repeal of this section which i do not believe is to the governments credit <e> <s> it does not aid immigration policy which i believe all members should support on a bipartisan basis <e> <s> it is if possible to turn into good citizens those who are here but who deprived of family relationships may turn into citizens who are not good either because of a sense of grievance or because of the social disability that they have <e>", "<cs> it is with deep regret that i listen to the noble earl <e> <s> our approach was to ask him to do something to save circumstances from arising after the repeal of section of the act and to do it for the sake of the children and i repeat uniting members of the family <e>", "<cs> what i am asking the noble earl to do and i should like to be precise in my language is this <e> <s> i am saying that children who had certain rights together with their parents of being united are being robbed of those rights by a total repeal of subsection <e> <s> i am asking the noble earl whether he is prepared sympathetically to consider some limitation of that repeal so that some rights remain for children who otherwise would have been protected by subsection <e> <s> i do not ask it under this amendment for spouses or for any other relations or dependants but purely for the children <e>", "<cs> i take it for granted that the noble earl and the government will always consider what has been said in this committee <e> <s> i am afraid that gets me nowhere and with great reluctance i ask that the opinion of the committee be taken <e>", "<cs> here again i believe that if a debate took place i should be saying exactly the same things all over again <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be a useful <e>", "<cs> i propose to make a short comment as i believe was made in the course of second reading debate <e> <s> this is a provision where we presumably express our horror at polygamous marriages wherever they may take place and even if they are perfectly proper legal and respectable in the countries in which they occur <e> <s> i hope that in dealing with a situation which involves a maximum of cases each year the committee in passing this clause will have in mind an improvement in our own moral standards in this country relating to marriage and divorce and many such similar issues <e> <s> if we can with sanctity pass this clause i hope at least it will have that effect <e>", "<cs> with great deference i do not think the minister really knows what happens in the home office <e> <s> i am talking about the immigration department <e> <s> there are other departments in the home office for which the noble earl is responsible and i am sure that he knows everything that ought to be known in their regard but he is not responsible for immigration <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the noble earl may have misunderstood me and if it is a want of clarification on my part then i apologise to him <e> <s> i made the point that in some instances people writing from abroad to the home office immigration department for documentation to enable them to enter the country perfectly properly are having difficulties in receiving replies i imagine in the same way that i have <e> <s> i did not of course address those letters to ministers they were addressed to the immigration department of the home office <e> <s> indeed the last letter i wrote still unanswered and unacknowledged i specially headed for the personal attention of the senior officer in charge of immigration or words to that effect <e> <s> however i have still not received an answer <e> <s> the committee will appreciate that this may well be the lot of people writing from abroad to try to obtain confirmation of matters which would satisfy an immigration officer <e> <s> that was the point i was trying to make not the chaos at the home office <e>", "<cs> i cannot deal with every case and then say that a person should or should not have a right of appeal <e> <s> there will be deserving cases and i <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i shall make two rapid points <e> <s> i shall then have exhausted the committees patience and i shall make no further points <e> <s> the noble earl has not covered the case i know him well enough to know that it would grieve him if he came across it of a man who had genuinely had his papers stolen from him in the course of a voyage not an unlikely event as other people would want papers and would want to use them for a nefarious end and who heard that an immigration officer did not believe him and sent him all the way back without a right of appeal <e> <s> i wonder what guilt the noble earl would feel over the fact that the appeal provisions were not contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl can assist the committee in this way <e> <s> one of the difficulties that we face is that on investigation one finds that some adjudicators go into compassionate grounds and make recommendations while others do not <e> <s> that leads to some confusion as to the rights of adjudicators <e> <s> perhaps a solution would be for us not to press the amendment at this stage and for the noble earl to give consideration to some consistency of ruling as regards adjudicators as to whether or not one encourages them to make recommendations <e> <s> if they are permitted to make recommendations perhaps that could be made universal <e> <s> if the noble earl will say that he will look into the position i do <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> it is not a question of whether or not adjudicators should be inhibited <e> <s> there should be a clarification of general practice <e> <s> however the noble earl has said that he will look into the matter <e> <s> in those circumstances i believe i am right in saying that my noble and learned friend is prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that he has not only a very open mind which i am delighted to find but also a very clear mind <e> <s> i listened most respectfully to his remarks <e> <s> the wording of the amendment may be imperfect although i do not think that it is <e> <s> however if it is imperfect we are still at the committee stage and since the noble lord has correctly sensed my aim in this amendment if other wording has to be employed then perhaps it can be done at a later stage <e> <s> the government may accept the spirit of the amendment or on hearing from the minister as i hope i shall that the principle is accepted i shall try to bring forward another amendment at the report stage <e>", "<cs> what can one do in the face of such politeness but such hardness as well <e> <s> i say that for the following reasons and the minister knows that i speak with respect <e> <s> the first thing is that the committee and the other place have heard that there should be no final appeal such as was asked for when the very serious matter of deportation was discussed because after all it was said matters of compassion are fully investigated before the final order so there ought not to be an appeal against the final order as it was all considered when the appellate procedure was gone through <e> <s> that included the adjudicators <e> <s> in another place the minister said with perfect sincerity that the adjudicators listen to compassionate grounds and that they can and do make recommendations <e>", "<cs> my only object is to produce the right result <e> <s> i realised when i put the word shall into the amendment i hope i am always frank with the committee that that was mandatory <e> <s> it was not a slip or a mistake <e> <s> it was put in intentionally <e> <s> when the noble lord lord renton said with all frankness that he had an open mind but was worried by the word shall i quickly thought while on my feet that rather than lose the amendment at committee stage it would obviously be better in protecting those whom i wanted to protect to say to the minister i hope with clarity that if the mandatory shall were removed and the words shall be entitled to were put in that being the matter worrying the noble lord lord renton the spirit of my amendment would be accepted <e>", "<cs> i think that others apart from myself were seeking some further response from the minister <e> <s> i am sorry that he regards himself in any way as being brought to his feet as it were at my command <e> <s> i do not think that i hold that position in your lordships house <e> <s> i merely rely as others do upon the courtesy of ministers to reply to questions and to relevant remarks <e> <s> one can never find fault with the noble earl in that connection <e> <s> i therefore think that he gets up quite voluntarily and automatically and not at my behest <e> <s> indeed i imagine that the same position will obtain when i have finished what i have to say now <e>", "<cs> i always find that the noble lord is very helpful in regard to all merciful causes and in <e>", "<cs> as usual the learning of my noble friend lord renton if i may call him that is accurate <e> <s> that was the very point that i raised <e> <s> peculiarly enough one could defeat the plea of <e>", "<cs> i wish it did because i should love there to be agreement between the noble earl and myself at long last <e> <s> i do not think that is the answer because i repeat and this is the advice presumably given to the immigration bodies which i mentioned that the advice is that one could have a prosecution for having knowingly overstayed the leave on monday i repeat it is to be a continuing offence under this bill and the court is not satisfied that on monday the defendant knew he had overstayed his leave and in those circumstances he would be acquitted <e> <s> the prosecution could then come back even though that was a period before the charge was heard and say oh yes i am now alleging he knew on tuesday <e>", "<cs> i promise to address the committee in english and only in english in furtherance of this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i should give another example because if i may say so most respectfully i do not think that the ministers example of drunkenness was at all good <e> <s> i am not at all sure that it is a defence to say <e> <s> i did not know because i was drunk <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not quite following the noble earl <e> <s> i have no doubt it is my fault <e> <s> i was saying something rather different from that bearing in mind that it was a continuing offence <e> <s> i was saying that the offence starts from the last day when leave has expired <e> <s> what i am saying is that no prosecution should be brought more than three years after that offence was committed bearing in mind that it is a continuing offence <e> <s> otherwise one can go on from day to day and make the three years start from any one of those days instead of from the date when the <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to tell the committee a lovely story about the last of the serjeants who was serjeant sullivan <e>", "<cs> the fact that the noble lord remembers him means that there is a continuing remembrance if i can use the phrase among many of us <e> <s> serjeant sullivan was addressing the court of appeal in regard to a workmans compensation case which could in fact have also been a common law case <e> <s> one of the learned lord justices of appeal turned to the serjeant and mentioned the principle of <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e> <s> we are here dealing with criminal prosecutions <e> <s> that has nothing to do with the power of the home secretary to deport and to do such things as he has the power and possibly the duty to do <e> <s> we are merely dealing with the criminal law <e>", "<cs> it continues to be a continuing offence <e> <s> if this amendment is passed what one cannot do is to prosecute that man for it as a criminal offence after three years have expired from the date of the expiry of the leave to remain here or to enter <e>", "<cs> i rise for the last time as regards this amendment <e> <s> i ought to have made it clear that in those circumstances if this clause remains without amendment the law is now going to be stricter than it was before <e> <s> if the offence is only committed before we made it a continuing offence on one day then the present immigration law would be that one cannot prosecute that man more than three years after that day <e> <s> by making it a continuing offence we are making the offence more strict the punishment more strict and the power to prosecute more strict <e> <s> that is what i ought to have brought to the attention of the committee <e> <s> by making it a continuing offence this is what we are doing <e> <s> i notice that the noble earl of his own volition wishes to rise <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has repeated in far clearer language what i was saying earlier <e> <s> until it is made a continuing offence prosecution cannot be brought more than three years after the date on which it is alleged the offence has been committed which is the day after the leave expires <e>", "<cs> i rise only to utter a few words after the rather moving speech of my noble friend lord pitt <e> <s> if this is to be an offence i can see the logic of it being a continuing offence and not as the house of lords ruled an offence committed only on one day the day upon which knowingly the leave expired <e> <s> i see the logic of that <e> <s> what i feel is bad judgment on behalf of the government is to make the matter a criminal offence at all <e> <s> as my noble friend lord pitt has said the home office has some quite draconian powers <e> <s> it can deport and do other things even if it means breaking up a family if an illegal immigrant is found to be guilty of that offence <e> <s> the police do not want that and they have said so <e> <s> to add the criminal prosecution would mean policemen going round interviewing taking statements prosecuting and giving evidence at the very time when our own <e>", "<cs> if that were the only objection that the noble lord lord renton had to make to my amendment i should be more than content <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find the opposition to this amendment a little difficult to understand <e> <s> the logic of it would be that those who were unsuccessful in an appeal deserved to be unsuccessful <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a proposition about which nobody would want to argue <e> <s> to say that somebody might have come in with commonwealth nationality and then decided to become a pole would mean i should have thought that his appeal was bound to fail <e> <s> if somebody had come in deliberately deceiving an immigration officer and he appealed once again i should have imagined he would be an unsuccessful appellant <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the noble lord lord bonham-carter i shall answer the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> we are talking only about an appeal where a deportation order has been made <e> <s> in the case that the noble lord lord bonham-carter mentioned the person who obviously had some amount of culture and ability was able to present his case however it may have been deferred to the home office in the normal way <e> <s> very often immigrants do not have that capacity <e>", "<cs> the noble earl talked about entering the country illegally <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl did not intend to create that impression but anyone listening to him would imagine that someone is only an illegal immigrant if he enters this country illegally <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> a person can become an illegal immigrant having entered this country perfectly legally <e> <s> he comes in saying that he is a visitor and intends to be a visitor <e> <s> subsequently events may occur i have given this example before where the visitors permit that was obtained is no longer a valid permit <e> <s> then somebody says that under the immigration rules that person is now strictly an illegal immigrant because he came in as a visitor but is no longer a visitor <e> <s> that man will have no right at all of appeal as the law now stands except <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is confusion <e> <s> the right of appeal should exist in order that a person can put a case that he did not mislead the immigration officer <e> <s> that person should be able to put forward a case that when he said he was a visitor he meant that he was a visitor and that was the truth <e> <s> there should be a right of appeal against someone who says that he does not think that that person was telling the truth that he deceived the immigration officer and that he never intended to be a visitor at all <e> <s> that person may allege that the immigrant intended to come here and tried to stay here for a very different reason <e> <s> that person may then declare the immigrant to be an illegal immigrant and make a deportation order <e>", "<cs> that was a very gracious response on the part of the noble earl <e> <s> i accept what he says and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will forgive me but i do not think he quite caught the point that as i understood it my noble and learned friend was advancing <e> <s> this was the point i believe is the noble earl saying that this is a common protection in regard to immigration where members of the mission are concerned <e> <s> in other words does it apply in other countries <e> <s> are we likely to be affected by this clause in regard to membership of our missions abroad <e> <s> i believe that was the point of the question <e> <s> i am advancing it now because of our rules at report stage that only one speech is permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can readily understand why the noble lord finds that this might be confusing to the house <e> <s> i am wondering whether some sensible arrangement cannot be made which will commend itself to him and to the house <e> <s> it seems to be foolish to have a debate on these two clauses separately <e> <s> although i believe that originally it was thought sensible to have amendments nos <e> <s> and grouped together i wonder whether the house and the noble lord lord mcnair will accept that it would be desirable to have amendment no <e> <s> also spoken to in regard to this matter <e> <s> precisely the same principles apply <e>", "<cs> my lords mercy and the guardianship of our traditional history do not constitute a monopoly for any part of your lordships house <e> <s> this is one of those series of amendments on the bill when i believe that in every section of the house there is what the noble lord lord renton described as an open mind but at the same time a receptive mind as to how best we deal in this era of all eras with our participation in the relief of the problems of genuine refugees <e>", "<cs> but i would my lords <e> <s> i have more faith in the noble earl than presumably some of his colleagues have <e> <s> first perhaps i may make the point that when i suggested to the house and the house was good enough to agree that similar subjects should be taken together since our speeches would be concentrated on them and the time of the house would be saved we were dealing purely and simply with the right of appeal <e> <s> that matter was put to the house and the house to my personal regret has decided in a certain way in regard to the right of appeal <e> <s> with all due respect to the noble lord lord renton we are now dealing with an entirely different matter <e> <s> it has nothing to do with appeals <e> <s> it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i said and the noble lord lord renton will have heard me that the amendment we are dealing with which is amendment no <e> <s> has nothing to do with the question of appeals <e> <s> we have not reached the other amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton is not at the moment in his place and for all i know that amendment may not be moved <e> <s> i merely say in order to be perfectly frank with the house that when i read his amendment i thought it went far too far to stand any chance of being accepted by the government <e> <s> i would in all frankness make that remark if and when the amendment is moved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add briefly to the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton raised a point which should be dealt with <e> <s> i believe he suggested to the house that on the wording of the amendment the mere fact that someone could say that he had a spouse parent or child settled in the united kingdom would entitle him as of right to a successful appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord says to appeal then that must be right <e> <s> if he had said that someone was entitled merely on proof of such facts to succeed on appeal that would obviously have been wrong <e> <s> i should have then referred the noble lord to the words of the amendment <e> <s> if that is the noble lords understanding it is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble earl but he will know that the matter with which he is now dealing is entirely separate from this amendment and forms the subject of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall be arguing the case on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am sure that he would not wish me to argue it now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right and i am grateful to him <e> <s> in fact i was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thought that amendment no <e> <s> had already been dealt with <e> <s> however i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> will not be moved <e> <s> we wish to reconsider the position and will see where we stand at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has been gracious enough to say that he has some respect for the fact that not only did i attempt to move an amendment twice but i made two speeches which had some variety <e> <s> perhaps i also may say that we are always delighted to hear the noble earl <e> <s> he succeeds in saying no to every amendment and does it by different methods and different speeches <e> <s> i admire the variety that he offers just as he admired my own <e>", "<cs> my lords i rely upon the ministers words when he states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to know that the noble earl has at last agreed with me <e> <s> that has not been very common in the course of either the committee stage or report stage of this bill <e> <s> i wish i understood the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will never know the extent of the temptation which the noble earl has pointed in this direction <e> <s> i was so tempted to call a division in order to see him walk with me but i shall resist the temptation in view of the seriousness of the bill and the time <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble earl and i hope that his graciousness will be repeated in the course of this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of his remarks the noble earl likened the parallel of a british citizen and a national of an ec member state to comparing piccadilly circus with a tuesday afternoon <e> <s> i invite him in all seriousness to go to piccadilly circus any tuesday afternoon that he chooses and talk to the british citizens who pass through that place <e> <s> i suggest that he tells them that her majestys government and indeed the united kingdom parliament have decided that if any british citizen cares to marry a yugoslav wife before that wife can enter this country and settle here with him he will have to prove that such a marriage was genuine <e> <s> furthermore he will have to prove not only that the marriage took place for the purpose of love and affection and not for the purpose of immigration but also that he can and will maintain her in a residence which is suitable to accommodate both of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will think that i have carried out a proper duty in bringing these matters to the attention of the house <e> <s> they are serious and there is a sense of grievance whatever the minister may say and say with great sincerity <e> <s> there is great grievance among foreign carriers who feel that they are being unjustly and wrongly treated under the provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that once again all noble lords will wish to pay a tribute to the two law commissions whose recommendations are responsible for this useful little bill <e> <s> it does a great deal of tidying up <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister agrees that there is a priority importance in abolishing the conflicting jurisdiction of courts will he not also agree that added to that is the priority to deal with juvenile delinquency <e> <s> is he aware that one of the causes of juvenile delinquency is the way in which matrimonial disputes are dealt with and the divorce rate is increasing <e> <s> accordingly will the minister tell his right honourable friend who is dealing with the matter and perhaps also the noble and learned lord sitting on the woolsack how much importance is given by the opposition in this house to the creation of family courts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down in the course of his very lucid exposition of this bill he raised the question of whether this bill would proceed or whether there would be a government bill and at the end he said that he could not predict whether this bill would become law <e> <s> perhaps he can tell the house in view of certain rumours which are about whether or not it is intended that in the automatic way this bill will have a committee stage and other stages if second reading is passed or whether it is the intention of the noble lord or of others to ensure that this bill is withdrawn even if it receives a second reading <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will be frank with the house <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be a debate on a subject spoken of often in your lordships house but it has still been quite entrancing <e> <s> there have been two very notable speeches and i say that from the benches that i represent one being from the noble and learned lord lord donaldson <e> <s> he mentioned the much respected name of lord du parcq <e> <s> i am long enough in the profession to which i joyfully belong to remember as does the noble and learned lord lord donaldson that mr justice du parcq was founder and creator of a new procedure <e> <s> i believe that he would have been delighted to have heard the young counsel who appeared before him now as the master of the rolls and a member of your lordships house advocating a new procedure to take the place of the official secrets act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord bethell did not think that i would ever wish to be offensive to him <e> <s> in this instance the question of courage was only meant as an inducement to him and not in any way to spoil the record which he has in this house by way of the speeches that he makes here and the way in which he moved the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i ask him to continue in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will be courteous enough to give way again <e> <s> he is putting up a magnificent defensive fight and i think that we all admire it <e> <s> i think that even the noble and gallant lord would admire the battle that is being put up by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones has asked me to apologise to the house and to the minister for the fact that he has had to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> he has a very important public function to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl may be aggressive but he is always courteous <e> <s> he has allowed me to reply to him <e> <s> first it is not i who am not

minister accept our congratulations on the very effective prevention of crime notices and the brief programmes which have appeared on television <e> <s> in addition to the neighbourhood watch schemes helping the prevention of crime is his department ensuring that local authorities get the means to carry out effective programmes with proper caretakers on council estates proper burglar alarms and proper locks being installed and proper lighting in the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make an immediate apology of a very humble nature to the house for my absence during the speech of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he accept certainly from me that if the home office ever has to make an excuse and to apologise it could not have a more acceptable representative to make the apology <e> <s> having said that does he realise that firm warnings were given by the civil service union of what was likely to occur by way of this backlog <e> <s> no steps were taken until the deluge occurred <e> <s> does the noble earl also realise that the home office has presented an unacceptable face of inefficiency and inhumanity as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord not regard it as highly dangerous that announcements should be made that defendants can afford better counsel than the prosecution <e> <s> is not that a highly dangerous statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the length of the list of speakers not only indicates the great national interest in the question of summer time but also encourages the house during dinner hour business to have a self-denying ordinance in regard to the length of speeches <e> <s> i intend to impose that ordinance upon myself <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl proceeds to another point and without asking him for a categorical assurance today because that may not be fair i should like to ask whether he will undertake to report to his right honourable friends in the home office

majestys government to put on record that the fact that they have assented to the directive does not mean that they are accepting that it is a proper use of article a and its powers <e>", "<cs> my

<e> <s> perhaps she might say that her noble friend and the opposition as well as herself supported this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords without being able to emulate the noble earls wit do the government consider that the intrusion of the ec into the shops acts and the reply made by the noble earl to the effect that it is up to local authorities to enforce such laws mean that it would be much wiser to leave such matters to local authorities instead of having a national act <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the description of the new passport by the noble lord lord st john of fawsley is an overstatement or an understatement can the minister explain to the house why tradition should be sacrificed to the computer <e> <s> would it not be more acceptable to ask the computer to produce something like the old british passport <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in suspecting that the noble earl has a sample of the new passport with him <e> <s> will he show that to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have been interested as always in the observations of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway as to jurisdiction <e> <s> can the minister clear up one point for the benefit of the house is it a fact that continuity of employment and security of employment in these critical days of unemployment is not in the public or the national interest to consider <e> <s> do the government not think that the proper course is to ask for an assurance from a swiss company concerning the security of employment in the future <e> <s> would the minister regard it as objectionable if another government looking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to persist but the minister who is always frank with the house has not been frank on this occasion because he has not answered one question that i put to him <e> <s> i was asking about national and public interest and employment whether an assurance could not be sought and whether it was not right to seek it <e> <s> may i remind him that unfortunately the past has shown that some people bid for companies to break them up and not to continue them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the question is very important in regard to the detection of crime and the saving of manpower <e> <s> can he give the house news about the development of at least three devices <e> <s> the first device about which the police are very keen is afr automatic fingerprint retrieval which is already in use in the united states canada and japan <e> <s> the second device is the electronic photofit which is at an experimental stage in hertfordshire but which is not in use generally <e> <s> the third device is the very useful automatic notebook known technically as the hhid the hand-held input device <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble earl for his customary courtesy can the house be assured that these matters are receiving his urgent attention as a minister with special responsibility for the police because the police themselves to my certain knowledge are most anxious that they should be proceeded with with diligence <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the answer to the question of houses in multiple occupation and hostels that they ought to be designated under the act dealing with fire prevention and required to have a certificate as a result <e> <s> is the minister aware that the greatest fire authority dealing with the problem namely the one which covers the metropolis is extremely anxious as a matter of policy that that should happen so that it can as a fire authority have proper liaison with the housing authority <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who most likely will have to declare an interest as a consequence of asking this supplementary question may i ask the minister whether he is conscious of the fact that there is a general feeling among the public that much wheelclamping is done at random <e> <s> is he aware though how in the name of heaven he can be i know not that at about pm yesterday near russell square i observed that a british telecom vehicle had been clamped and heard the drivers language when he found it <e> <s> it was somewhat disturbing <e> <s> it appears that the vehicle was in that place in order to carry out some telephone repairs <e> <s> does he not consider that an example of that kind which i personally witnessed indicates that wheelclamping operations are done at random and somewhat carelessly <e>", "<cs> is that really good enough however politely uttered <e> <s> if this amendment is to be dealt with seriously and on the basis as the noble lord has just indicated that we know that what the minister has said will have the force of law even though it be not written into the bill it is essential for the committee to know whether a code of practice is merely persuasive or mandatory otherwise it may be unconsciously misled by the noble earl <e> <s> is it not a fact that a code of practice is only persuasive whereas a regulation is mandatory <e> <s> is the noble earl prepared to say that what can or cannot be seen by the registrar will form the basis of a regulation or is he merely telling the committee that there will be a document which can be acted upon at the will of the parties concerned because it will be purely guidance <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and most appreciative of the gracious manner in which he moved the amendment and of his personal courtesy to me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the circular to which he referred circular no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express the gratitude of every member of your lordships house to the minister for his enthusiasm and zeal in a very proper cause <e> <s> however is it not possible in the planning being done by the home office to indicate when it is programming the end of an era where people on remand are still being put into police cells <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very subjective <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful and not for the first time to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising a serious matter with regard to our prisons <e> <s> if he will allow me to say so we have been jointly concerned about the figures for remand prisoners in police cells <e> <s> i raised that question in the house only a couple of days ago by way of a supplementary question to the home office minister who was then if i may use the phrase on duty <e> <s> i asked whether the home office had any programme date by which the target would be reached of no more remand prisoners in police cells <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and leaves for a restful weekend i should like to ask him to refer to the suggestion that i ventured to make <e> <s> i suggested that in view of the urgency of the problem and there is no doubt that discussions are taking place but as we know they often consist of a game of ping-pong between departments would it not be worth at least considering my suggestion that a committee should be set up consisting of representatives of the police the prison service and the dhss until the situation is we hope dealt with <e> <s> obviously i do not ask for the misnisters assurance that such a committee will be set up i merely ask that the suggestion should be seriously considered <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that civic pride and initiative are being retarded throughout the country by the governments policy of demoting local authorities <e> <s> is this not therefore a wonderful opportunity for the government to make specific grants for the purpose mentioned by the noble lord lord renton in order once again to encourage civic pride and to let authorities have some status <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord graham of edmonton for the lucid and if i may say so very sober way in which he introduced the second reading of this important little bill <e> <s> the bill states in one short sentence at the very top of the first page what its object is <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house wishes to express a word of appreciation to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for having steered this little bill through the house <e> <s> we have of course supported the bill <e> <s> i can only wish from these benches that more publicity had been given to it and <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister concede that his reply to the noble baronesss question was not as considered as his replies usually are <e> <s> is he not aware that a grave problem arises especially in view of the overcrowded conditions in prisons and the lack of a legal pointer to the duties of medical officers towards other prisoners and to the families of a prisoner as well as in regard even to the enforced examination to see whether aids exists <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister forgive me if i return to this very important subject <e> <s> i suggested nothing except the setting up of a committee because of the peculiar difficulties of dealing with prisoners in crowded prisons where there is a duty to fellow prisoners a duty to families quite outside the normal community <e> <s> will the minister at least consider setting up a committee without giving a definite answer now <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise that this is the last time that i appear at the dispatch box on this matter but it is a very urgent problem <e> <s> will the minister reflect upon the worth of what a committee investigating this matter might recommend in regard to compulsory powers in prisons <e> <s> will he take into account the fact that many in this house might not regard it as an invasion of privacy if peoples health and possibly lives are at stake if this is not done <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful as usual for the gracious and lucid way in which the bill has been introduced by the noble earl <e> <s> i must tell him at once that i have a personal grievance which i wish to utter <e> <s> he has stolen my references to the names of the distinguished noble earls who will be maiden speakers <e> <s> as i object to being a gramophone record of the noble earl i merely say that i am sure that all noble lords will welcome their speeches when they are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult enough to speak for the opposition in this country i find it impossible to speak for the government of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could help the noble earl <e> <s> my colleagues in this house have been extremely patient in listening to the speeches of others when they were making them <e> <s> the noble earl was i think just about to reach a stage where with his usual courtesy he was going to answer the various points that i made <e> <s> those are committee points and i release the noble earl completely from any discourtesy if he should now decide to wind up finally so that the house can have a happy weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay full tribute to those who formulate those schemes and the volunteers who take part in them but is it not a fact that in the main they are in the wealthier and better off neighbourhoods <e> <s> is there not a very grave concern that in many council estates there are no such schemes and there is no substitution at all for the policeman on patrol <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for that statement <e> <s> i listened to it with some pleasant surprise <e> <s> having read <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is very gracious <e> <s> however i read that paragraph and my reference was supposed to be one of sorrow that the white paper was not dealing with the information which the public is entitled to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the house has been informed that there is a very critical situation in relation to court clerks generally in the magisterial service <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that there is not only a shortage in establishment but there is some sort of deficiency in quality in the new recruitment <e> <s> is this not due to competitive salary offers both in the legal profession and in the crown prosecution service <e> <s> in those circumstances does he agree that it is a very critical matter and that the whole question of terms and conditions of service of these people must be looked at if the situation is to be remedied <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging the limited and all too belated measures to which the minister has referred do not the government feel a profound sense of shame at the barbaric conditions which were disclosed in the report of the chief inspector of prisons conditions which were also breaches of fundamental human rights and dignities to which the completely unconvicted prisoners have been subjected <e> <s> in view of the critical circumstances will the minister confirm that a senior civil servant will be appointed to supervise the implementation of the urgent recommendations in the report <e> <s> will he also consider an immediate increase in the number of inspectors so that these institutions are in fact inspected at intervals of less than eight to years <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will forgive me if i return to the matter for a moment <e> <s> i was asking whether the government would increase the number of inspectors so that inspections can take place at intervals of less than eight to years <e> <s> in view of the critical report will he ask his right honourable friend whether that can- be done <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will not give a small amount of attention to the dignity of this <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be indebted to the minister for the very clear way in which he has explained the provisions of the order <e> <s> i believe that this is an occasion when the house should congratulate the government on the progress which at long last is being made to ensure that there is a general tape recording of statements being made by an accused <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that matter i wonder whether he would deal with the point which i endeavoured to make <e> <s> if the legislation follows the lines of the white paper in regard to secret information given by one government to another on foreign affairs would he not admit that the foreign office officials who spoke to winston churchill in the way that they did and certainly the one whom i named would have committed a criminal offence without having any kind of defence about public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a great deal of concern among welfare officers and others interested in our citizens about the way in which loan sharks are operating in various urban areas <e> <s> in view of his reply to one of my noble friends will the minister see whether his department can issue a widely publicised notice indicating that any complaints regarding unregistered moneylenders are to be sent to his department and will there be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene in order to let the minister know how we on these benches feel regarding this amendment and any which follows a similar line <e> <s> at the committee stage the noble earl was asked by several members of the committee whether something could be done for the disabled <e> <s> the indication was that the minister would think about that problem realising as he did the hardship that might be imposed upon those who were disabled without the public being endangered in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he can give an indication as i requested him to do as regards consideration of the problems of the disabled <e> <s> many of us are thinking of ex-servicemen who have been disabled as a result of gallant service <e> <s> are the government able to make any concession in the provisions of this bill by way of application for licences for firearms or whatever <e> <s> although we realise the general purpose of the bill all of us who are in sympathy with the specific case of ex-servicemen may feel that it has been carefully considered and the government have made some concessions <e> <s> is there anything that the government have to offer them in the course of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for repeating this important statement which has been made in another place let us start from one common platform that is a complete hatred and detestation of everything that has been done and is being planned by the terrorist organisations to which the noble earl referred <e> <s> however i wish to point out to the house the rather considerable inconsistency and possible lack of wisdom in the step that has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i once before quoted to your lordships a portion of a speech made by the first lord samuel who graced this house when he was making an address in honour of the centenary of the modern civil service <e> <s> after paying a gracious tribute to the civil service which had helped him so much in his career he added the words <e>", "<cs> my lords it may have been a fast ball but it was a straight ball <e> <s> it was not a googly <e> <s> in those circumstances as the noble earl has been kind enough to say that before third reading he will look into the suggestion that has just been made naturally i would want to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i should like to express my appreciation to the minister for his promise <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i have given fairly short notice to the minister of a point that i wanted helpfully to make <e> <s> obviously i am in agreement with the whole principle of the amendment <e> <s> it is with a smile having regard to what the noble and learned lord lord hailsham together with the noble lord lord renton who is in his seat said on my previous amendment that i quote to your lordships the section with which we are dealing in the principal act <e> <s> section a says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is very kind <e> <s> i did not have that example in mind at all and i apologise if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i had in mind that the courts discretion ought not to be interfered with by this bill when it becomes an act <e> <s> as we noted when we looked at the principal act there are many reasons why a certificate may have been revoked intemperate habit the wrong weapons in the owners possession or otherwise if i may again with great bitterness quote those words <e>", "<cs> my lords it may assist in the debate if i intervene briefly <e> <s> the example that the noble lord lord tryon gave would be excluded <e> <s> the amendment deals only with the situation where the offer to sell is communicated by post or advertisement <e> <s> there would be no objection to a person who wished to order himself coming under the provision <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am grateful to the noble earl for replying to the amendment <e> <s> i wish i could express the same gratitude for the content of the reply in the sense that if he has to take examples of somebody who is a criminal and somebody who is an innocent sender i ask him occasionally to reverse the situation and make himself the criminal and me the innocent sender <e> <s> on quite a number of occasions the noble earl has given ingenious examples and i have always appeared as the rather wicked person in the examples <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make clear the fact that i am not insulting the mail order business in any way <e> <s> i am merely trying to prevent something being ridden right the way through the protective legislation as a result of the criminal acts of others <e> <s> in those circumstances i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount had such an appealing look on his face that even an amateur colleague would like to seek to assist him if possible <e> <s> as i understand the procedure of the house and i say this with all humility with the agreement of the house there would be nothing to stop amendment nos <e> <s> and being spoken to at the same time as amendments nos <e> <s> to which are grouped together <e> <s> if the noble viscount therefore wishes to speak to amendment no <e> <s> on this debate and the house comes to a conclusion as to which amendment it wishes to support i should have thought that was the way to deal with his problem <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he would permit me to try to clarify the position in my own mind and for future readers of the legislation <e> <s> i well understand the noble earl when he says that the question of youngsters remains as it is now namely that if a licence is obtained at the age of or over user is perfectly in order <e> <s> the average layman reading the new clause would not know that that was the position <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the words of the noble earl i wish i could find that they meet anything that i said when i moved this amendment <e> <s> words in a statute mean what they say <e> <s> when one deals with the terms of reference of a committee one is using words which bind the committee to those functions and do not allow it to expand upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i would receive a warm reception from the house if i continued this argument in order to answer the minister <e> <s> i do not intend to do that <e> <s> i assure him that i listened with respect to what he said <e> <s> i shortly say that i do not agree with what he said as a proper interpretation <e> <s> however he has kindly promised to look again at this matter and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help wondering what all the fuss is about and why we should have to enter into constitutional arguments when as i see it we have a straightforward practical proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords it was done with courtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only to say that that was before hungerford <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that acceptance of such a no-fault <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that that last remark was consistent with the noble earls actions <e> <s> nevertheless it would be most ungracious of me if i did not thank him most sincerely for what he has said and done <e> <s> i ask the house for leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl usually shows a great breadth of vision <e> <s> it has been somewhat narrowed down in my humble estimation by the guidance he has received on this occasion <e> <s> i ask the house to treat this question very seriously indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i have to preface my remarks with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be lacking and very peculiarly so in clarity this afternoon <e> <s> i apologise to the house if that be so <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord hailsham agrees that i am lacking in clarity then in those circumstances i must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should weary the house to the point of absolute boredom if i were to continue this argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i may risk doing that to the house but i certainly should not risk doing it to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in the circumstances all i can do is to divide the house for the simple reason that i want it to be on record that i tried in what i believe to be an honourable cause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl could not sufficiently contain himself to prevent him making the remark that the amendments we have presented and the speech that i tried to make upon them were appropriate third reading speeches <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord complained about was something quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers clear statement as to the intention of the clause he and i of course appreciate that his speech although welcome to the house is not one that can be quoted when trying to interpret the act in the courts of law and the fact that the advice he has received is that the purpose of what i was trying to do is already covered i was merely trying to act out of abundant caution i am not prepared to divide the house on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no minister who could have brought a firearms bill before your lordships house with less aggression <e> <s> without any doubt at all in the course of the passage of this bill through the house it has almost been a pleasure to be shot at in debate by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl feel that his right honourable friend has acted upon principles either of logic or justice in the decision he seems to have made <e> <s> is it not right that whereas there are many examples of national impingement upon conferences we are dealing with the defence of democracy in regard to party conferences of whatever colour they may be <e> <s> is it not right therefore that if we are defending a national tradition which is the whole basis of our constitution and rights the nation should pay and not ratepayers however small the percentage <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl mentioned that various parties were being consulted with regard to a change in sunday trading laws did he include in that number the interests of employees and trade unions who might be involved <e>

the noble earl aware that the figures were shocking before there was any question of industrial action being taken <e> <s> will he please look at the question which i venture to ask again with the recommendation that a working party be set up to report as a matter of urgency <e> <s> is he not prepared for such a working party to be created <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down feeling any contentment with his reply to the very valid point made by my noble friend the leader of the opposition perhaps i might be allowed to quote something said by the noble lord lord carrington when he was leader of the opposition <e> <s> the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not very noticeable that in almost all the supplementary questions asked on this very important matter youth has featured as the main item <e> <s> in view of the fact that at the root of crime prevention one has to look at the cause of crime would it not be a very good idea in view of the seriousness of the

particularly full at the moment <e> <s> one wishes that a debate on the metropolitan police who are perhaps the eyes and teeth of society had attracted the same audience as a debate on charges in

matter <e> <s> can he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble earl for the clear way in which he explained the purposes of the order that is now before us <e> <s> he also deserves congratulation for the way in which he pronounced the names of certain <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make it absolutely clear to the noble lord opposite that none of us consider him to

just listened with its usual attention to the noble baroness who speaks with such authority on the matters on which she has just addressed us <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord be good enough to explain to the house in view of the popular feeling that there is in regard to the matter of gazumping why he thinks that legislation is not necessary <e> <s> will he also say why he

official opposition the general approval of what in the history of our legislation may well be termed the childrens charter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord in view of the great concern in all parts of your lordships house about the question of resources would agree to put his very powerful weight in cabinet and elsewhere on the priority which this house give to

regards the bill as being an evolutionary stage towards a family court <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say immediately and i know that my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the noble and learned lord on his apt metaphor <e> <s> it is true that one must use the house while alterations are being made or considered <e> <s> i appreciate that <e> <s> may i take it from what he

the noble lord will forgive me for intervening at the very beginning of the speech <e> <s> i shall not interrupt him again whatever he may say hereafter that is a promise <e> <s> however i said that

of the house before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that this is the only time since i came to the house of lords that the noble lord lord mottistone has said such kind words <e> <s> i

british refugee council this amendment and the councils concern came very late and that is why i had no opportunity even to explain the amendment to the noble and learned lords department as i would normally have tried to do <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no criticism of the noble and learned lord that he had adhered in sheer consistency to the reply which he gave at the committee stage <e> <s> it is not a criticism of the noble and learned lord but it could be a criticism of the argument now before the house <e> <s> i endeavoured when moving the amendment to deal with the noble and learned

positive one <e> <s> it does not say that a child shall be able to apply <e> <s> but the court of course cannot grant the application if by any chance it finds that the child is lacking in understanding <e> <s> it is a perfectly negative provision and in view of what i have said i owe it to the noble and learned lord and to the house to read what is only one sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very persuasive reply to the amendment <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is not to see that the court behaves sensibly <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and only so that we can clarify one matter has he appreciated that the wording of clause is alternative <e> <s> in other words the leave of the court does not have to be obtained if those who have parental responsibility for the child consent to a change of name <e> <s> therefore the court may never be consulted on this matter and the wishes of the child may never be taken into account <e>", "<cs> it does <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord goes any further if he looks at the amendment with a little more care if i may respectfully say so he will see that it says that the child cannot be taken out of the jurisdiction nor can the childs name be changed unless there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the last thing in the world that the noble lord lord meston would want is that there should be any misunderstanding as to the wording of this amendment and its intention <e> <s> there is not one word in this amendment i know he will appreciate this but other members of the house having listened to his speech may be under some misunderstanding that says that black children shall only go with black foster parents or that white children shall only go with white foster parents <e> <s> all that this amendment says is that in the grouping of persons who are registered for this purpose there shall be care taken to reflect the racial groups comprising the population of that area <e> <s> in other words there will be one hopes black foster parents available and white foster parents available <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of those in your lordships

dear carer especially when he writes to him <e> <s> do not all these arguments and names alter with circumstances <e> <s> will not the circumstances dictate the right title for the child to call the party concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down for the guidance of the house will he explain what he means by favouring an agreement entered into between the local authority and the foster parent <e> <s> is he envisaging that some local authorities which some of us would describe as progressive would insist on an agreement of that kind whereas a neighbouring authority which did not insist on the agreement would have a situation where a foster parent was permitted to administer corporal punishment <e> <s> would that not be the most terrible injustice between various areas in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and and learned lord for the consideration which he has obviously given to what i said and indeed to what was said by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> like the noble baroness i got no joy in moving the amendment and drawing attention to cases where local authorities may fail the needs of the children

noble baroness lady faithfull for example will be helped <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with a little sadness that i reply to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> at the same time i should like to thank him for the obvious care which he has taken in order to let the house know his position on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder whether he again wishes to

the amendments on the marshalled list for today and see no objection to any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords thinking in terms of security against terrorism perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> does the minister agree that it would be far more effective if we were to ensure that there is not the slightest danger of people being able to be in contact with freight whether luggage or otherwise unless there was very careful inspection and the personnel concerned were also vetted and had proper cards <e> <s> is not that factor a great worry <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the

"<cs> my lords i beg the noble earls courtesy in intervening again <e> <s> i was trying to say that if there is to be a proper annual review the only fair way of dealing with it is by having a statutory instrument not dealing with the whole <e> <s> that means that those of us in the house who feel that generally the order is right have to vote against it <e> <s> that would not be the fair way of dealing with it <e>", "<cs> it is very rare that i have to say this of the noble lord the secretary of state but there is some injustice arising from the remarks that he has made <e> <s> in broad terms i do not see why a perfectly innocent citizen of this land is required as an officer of a company which also may be perfectly innocent to produce copies for the benefit of the state acting

defend any guilty party <e> <s> by all means such a person should bear such expense <e> <s> but why should the ordinary citizen not be covered by a provision in the bill <e> <s> i am not asking that it should be put in the bill if he is proved innocent <e> <s> under the provisions of section it should be within the competence of the inspectors and it should be the duty of the inspectors to see

please let us have a definition of book debts so that we know what we are talking about the governments reply presumably is that from which is the date i quoted as regards the learned mr justice

think me <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord has finished his address to the committee <e> <s> my only reason for interrupting was to help by saying that what he had advanced so far was sufficient reason for me to ask the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have heard of various reasons expressed in your lordships house for not protecting or for protecting vital civil liberties <e> <s> i have never heard before an explanation given on behalf of the government that there should be some stoppage upon the ability of the house to deal with a vital question of that kind

report will he acknowledge that all of us who are interested in prison and parole matters share the feeling of proprietorship <e> <s> will the minister therefore please assure the house that after the consultations have taken place to which he very properly and understandably referred it is likely that the governments response will be sooner rather than later <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted that the

be perfectly proper for a lawyer without committing any offence to do what i was trying to cover in my amendment <e> <s> with that assurance from the noble earl his assurances are always accepted by the house with great favour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are very few occasions on which i have felt sorry for the minister <e> <s> the reason why the occasions have been so few is that his ability and courtesy are so well known to this house that one finds him to be a most formidable spokesman for the ministry that he decorates <e>", "<cs> my lords to show how much more reasonable i am than the noble earl i agree with his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will not think that i am out of order in raising a point concerning the insolvency provisions which is not definitely in line with the amendment itself <e> <s> the point has a relationship i am trying awfully hard to bring a relationship into existence in the sense that insolvency practitioners from another country are to be put into the same position in certain respects as insolvency practitioners in this country <e> <s> therefore one is entitled to speak for one moment about

had been living at the moment and had been seated in the gallery of the chamber he would have rushed out and written a book called alice in football land <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the house will be grateful to the noble earl for the very lucid way in which he explained the order <e> <s> i should perhaps make it clear at once if it needs to be made clear at all that in every conceivable effort

much hope that the passing of that act will have a good effect on the motion that the house is about to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to add a few words from the bench on which i sit to say how much we welcome the fact that this bill contains a very definite duty upon local authorities which is enshrined in the bill itself <e> <s> i feel that any technical argument in regard to this matter is not appropriate <e> <s> every member of the public in every local authority should know when the bill leaves this house that we have provided firmly and clearly in the statute that local authorities have to take steps to identify the extent to which there are children in need within their areas and that they should take reasonable steps as set out in the second paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i too am satisfied that the words general principles should come out <e> <s> i was unhappy that those words did not include this principle <e> <s> in view of what the noble and learned lord has said i entirely agree with the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of us who have at heart exactly the same motives as the noble and learned lord in regard to physically disabled children will be delighted that this is on the face of the bill <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble and learned lord does not agree that if it is to appear on the face of the bill it might be in a rather more positive form <e> <s> to put a requirement on the local authority in regard to disabled children to say that it is not unsuitable to their particular needs is to put a negative requirement which is not always very helpful especially when you have the proviso in the amendment of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may say that this is a particularly important point <e> <s> with great consideration the noble and learned lord has taken into account what the noble lord lord meston suggested on a previous occasion with the general agreement of the chamber as i understand it <e> <s> it would have needed some kind of presentational addition to the bill in order to make it perfectly clear that the words that are so often used in a housing bill and elsewhere namely suitable accommodation do not simply mean that there is a room where the child can be properly accommodated for sleeping purposes and that there is other accommodation in the house which one needs for proper sanitary purposes <e> <s> suitable accommodation could well be defined in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i am going to make a third and short address to the house <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is always courteous in these matters <e> <s> i was dealing only with an observation made in answer to the speech that i made <e> <s> in those circumstances i believed that the house especially when dealing with handicapped children would not rely upon a point of order <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say briefly how gracious the noble and learned lord is on this occasion as he usually is <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble and learned lord that it will be of the greatest assistance if he speaks to all three but i trust that each will be put separately <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make it clear that while the noble and learned lord has been good enough to address his remarks to all three motions my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones has i know some points he wishes to raise on the first regulations and the order before the house <e> <s> i intend to limit my remarks to the legal advice and assistance scope regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord knows very well permanent disability is also referred to <e> <s> is he conscious of the fact and i say this with the deepest respect that a solicitor who wrongly claims under the green form scheme is guilty of an offence a professional offence and perhaps another offence as well <e> <s> to put upon him the burden of deciding whether someone has a permanent illness or a permanent disability is surely something which the noble and learned lord would not want the profession to bear <e> <s> i regarded the noble lords intervention as helpful <e> <s> perhaps a definition can be inserted into the regulations subsequently if the noble and learned lord adheres to the policy of the regulations <e>", "<cs> i should have made it clear to the committee when i moved the amendment that on the marshalled list there are two amendments under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they are obviously separate and i deal merely with the first amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> possibly the marshalled list could have a manuscript amendment amendment no <e> <s> a

in fact in a state of war <e> <s> nevertheless it was quite obviously a decision taken in a situation which is rather outside what we are discussing today <e> <s> i really wanted to correct the noble lord if he will allow me to do so on this matter <e> <s> he talked about our allies <e> <s> is he aware that the united states of america has in fact the very committee about which we are talking but that it has to report to congress <e> <s> of course we do not put that proposal forward in our amendment <e> <s> the united states has gone much further in that respect <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this chamber has become pleasantly accustomed to the eloquence of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i cannot measure my eloquence such as it may be against his but i hope at this last moment to be able to give the reasons why it is important that the view of the committee be taken <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that that is right and i have no doubt that it would be recognised by privy counsellors who have taken the privy council oath and by the lords of appeal in ordinary <e> <s> perhaps i may say at once to the noble lord lord allen that in the midst of a worthy speech he made one point which was singularly unworthy namely that there must be something wrong with the amendment if it did not recognise that a lord of appeal in ordinary was a privy counsellor <e> <s> i immediately say to him that he must have realised that one was talking about five privy counsellors and one who happened to be a privy counsellor and in addition a lord of appeal in ordinary <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down and following from the point that he has made will it be a direction to the security service because the poor complainant will not know this that where the security service has not been involved in the matters of which the complainant complains the security service will inform the complainant that the special branch was involved and that his complaint should go there <e> <s> the ordinary citizen will not know who has carried out an action and i do not suppose that the special branch will leave a visiting card <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is most kind but he has not answered the question i put to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether planted questions are dangerous to eat <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am in no way expressing one word of sympathy with the action of the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the committee without pretension that this amendment is not only capable of academic argument <e>

absolutely right to answer my argument with regard to existing members of the intelligence service and the existence of the staff counsellor <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i tried to instance the case of someone who had been a member of the intelligence service and who is writing his biography doing it perfectly correctly and not revealing any secrets <e> <s> he writes that during his time there he noticed that some people drank too much <e> <s> he can not go to the staff counsellor because he is no longer a member of the service <e> <s> or he may say that he regarded the entrants to the intelligence service as not being of sufficiently high standard giving reasons for his views as pay and so on <e> <s> that would constitute an offence <e> <s> it may have been a weak argument or a strong one but that was my argument <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for allowing me to give an explanation in view of the fact that he has called upon my name <e>", "<cs> i do not want to keep bobbing up and down but the committee is always very kind <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls will i am sure realise the absurdity in cases where a member of the intelligence service is talking to a minister responsible for security <e> <s> that minister defined in the bill as a crown servant makes a disclosure which is an offence under the bill

direct would be guilty whether or not the disclosure was harmful <e> <s> if the noble lord can think of a more alice-in-wonderland situation than that i invite him to give it to the committee <e>", "<cs> i hope that the leader of the house will forgive me <e> <s> i used the words alice in wonderland before but he realises that the minister he is talking about would have to serve the notification and he would therefore have to serve it upon himself <e>", "<cs> the committee will not welcome a lengthy answer to what has been said by the leader of the house <e> <s> he has deployed perfectly fair arguments as have other members who have particpated in the debate <e> <s> however i should like to emphasise in short sentences the reason for my hoping that the committee will pass the amendment

nd february in parliament <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not dramatising if i say that i noticed when the minister with his usual competence answered the debate on this amendment that he did so in a style which was faltering <e> <s> i must say that that is most unlike him <e> <s> however i can well understand why he faltered <e>", "<cs> that is precisely what i am saying <e> <s> indeed i am copying the government in doing so <e> <s> they introduce in clause a precisely that dilemma if dilemma it be and i suggest it is not and i shall quote from that part of the bill <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> we have reached a situation where first all amendments unless they be moved from the government benches are unreasonable and therefore should not be allowed <e> <s> the second stage is that while they are quite reasonable it is nevertheless appropriate not to agree to them <e> <s> the third stage has now been reached they are perfectly reasonable but they are unnecessary <e> <s> i wonder what further classification will be used from the benches opposite in order to ensure that not one word of the bill is altered and that not all the combined thinking of members of the opposition in your lordships house will ever penetrate through the governments very substantial armour <e> <s> somebody who receives notification is we recognise under a very great duty <e> <s> if he breaks the confidentiality which is very properly enforced as we all admit by this bill he will commit a criminal offence <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to see that there is justice <e> <s> sometimes bureaucracy or administration assists in justice and therefore justifies its existence <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton said that he was making his intervention before i sat down <e>

will <e>", "<cs> i am trying to meet absolutely fairly the argument put by the minister <e> <s> i am trying to see what onus there would be on the prosecution which would be an unfair onus <e> <s> let

at an earlier hour at another stage of the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i say with deep respect that in considering the amendments i hope the committee will not be confused by the thought that any member of the committee wishes to risk the good international relationships between this country and any other country <e> <s> in the margin next to the clause we see the words international relations <e> <s> it is with international relations that we ought to be dealing <e> <s> we ought strictly to confine our comments and thoughts to those words <e>", "<cs> i know that the

dealing with my request of the government to think again about the clause <e> <s> the request was reiterated by the noble lord lord renton to whom i am also grateful <e> <s> it would be ungracious of me not to express my appreciation <e>", "<cs> and of course i support completely what the noble lord lord hutchinson said which means that all is sweetness and tranquility <e> <s> perhaps the minister will add to that tranquility by saying at least as a compromise that the word endangers will be looked at <e> <s> it would be even better if he were able generously to accept that that word should be substituted <e> <s> it would indeed be an historic occasion if in regard to this bill as distinct from many that we have had in recent times there were some concession somewhere by the government to

fact that the interception of communications act contains those provisions perhaps i may remind my colleagues in this place that the incorporation of those sections in the statute was bitterly opposed by the government <e> <s> i had the privilege of moving the amendment that those clauses be in the bill and happily this place accepted the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was only explaining what has

insertion of the proposed words <e> <s> i believe that they ought to be there <e> <s> the defendant ought to be given the opportunity not of saying why he is entitled to retain the document as against the true owner <e> <s> that would be nonsense because as the minister pointed out title is in the crown <e> <s> the only use that could be made of those words is to say i know that i have to return the documents but unfortunately there were circumstances which prevented me from doing so <e> <s> that could be the only defence <e>", "<cs> i must not press the matter further but i had hoped that in the light of what i had said the minister would offer to consider whether the words giving the opportunity to the defendant of pleading a reasonable excuse could be inserted <e> <s> i endeavoured to tell him that obviously the title to the document could not possibly be an issue <e> <s> that could not be an argument before the court <e> <s> am i to understand that the noble lord will be kind enough to consider the amendment or that he cannot consider it <e>", "<cs> i cannot continue the dialogue pleasant though it is and courteous though the minister is <e> <s> i should like to say how

amendment <e> <s> i merely say that i may return to the issues at a later stage because i do not believe that the point that i was trying to make has been sufficiently answered <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord continues his most useful analysis perhaps i could mention that he passed over one item namely that it is not necessary under this section for that poor person to know whether or not the crown servant or government contractor has had the document <e> <s> by the mere fact that he has had it even if he does not know it he has committed an offence <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble earl has misunderstood the whole purpose of my remarks based on this amendment <e> <s> i am not quarrelling with the fact that there could be an offence of the nature that he described which the committee ought seriously to consider <e> <s> i am saying that it is a little far-fetched to think in terms of somebody committing an offence by disclosing information when he does not know that a civil servant has it or has had anything to do with it <e> <s> if a civil servant has that information or had it in the past it is an offence whereas if a civil servant did not have it but the person received if from another party he would not be committing any offence <e>", "<cs> i did not know that i was difficult to satisfy <e> <s> i can only tell the noble earl with a smile from this dispatch box that he is the most difficult minister to convince <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble earl not only for having read out his brief which was most helpful i make that absolutely clear but also for his promise to look at the drafting again in the light of what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is extremely welcome to hear the noble earl praise the latchmere project is he aware that even in its present circumstances that project could do with considerably more financial assistance <e> <s> in the light of the consideration being given to moving refugees from latchmere house to gosport is he prepared to consider the possibility of further financial aid being granted if such a move takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest immediately as i belong to a great wise and beneficent union <e> <s> i ask your lordships to guess which union that may be having regard to the debate that we have had <e> <s> having said

other respects this debate was unique in that your lordships always command the heights of courtesy in the debates of this house but some of the speeches that were made had stronger language in them

earl finds it exciting that the number of my mistakes is increasing i hope that it will be a competition which both of us find exciting over the years and that it will be mutual <e>", "<cs> my lords my argument is that it is not a reasonable point to put forward that in this bill we have protected juries from having to discuss and decide upon and counsel having an opportunity to deal in open court with matters concerning the nations security <e> <s> i am saying that this bill does it and if it does so in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister speaks to the amendment i wonder

having heard all the replies to it <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said that he regarded it as quite impracticable that any director general should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i say at once that he thought it was impracticable for the director general to say that the security service should be kept free of political influence <e> <s> if it was impracticable it is extraordinary that the directive of which said that that is exactly what the security service should be kept free of was worded so carefully by so eminent a minister in the noble lords own government that it has stood the test of time from until now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is most kind <e> <s> perhaps i may just consider that <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is right as is so often the case and i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some grief that i again come to the dispatch box to consider arguments against the amendment <e> <s> any disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages and the fairness of agreeing with the amendment <e> <s> the security service knows perfectly well that it has denied a clearance <e> <s> we are talking about a security clearance in regard to members of the civil service and similar organisations <e> <s> one knows perfectly well that there will be a response to the security service we note the lack of clearance here <e> <s> in the circumstances we are not employing mr x <e> <s> that would be necessary for the records of the security service <e> <s> one has protected the question of security by saying that if there are good security reasons for not then serving the notice the notice need not be served <e>", "<cs> my lords i at once recognise and immediately say that the noble and learned lord in replying to my amendment has given reasons which i find acceptable <e> <s> i wish that that had applied to other amendments that i have moved <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only because the noble and learned lord rightly said how important this is that i take the liberty of intervening <e> <s> he has talked in terms of the duty of the tribunal to investigate <e> <s> if he will kindly refer to paragraph where the word investigate occurs that is purely and simply limited to whether or not the complainant has been the subject of inquiries and not as to the nature of them or any other matter <e> <s> if i am wrong i know that the noble and learned lord will say where i am wrong but that is where the word investigate occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords now i risk the noble and learned lord being angry with me instead of anyone being angry with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> at all events that is ambiguous and i am sure that he will see that <e> <s> the duty to investigate is to investigate in accordance with the schedule and the only duty in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that his definition or description of the chinese and their treatment of tibet as a red herring was a somewhat unfortunate phrase to use <e> <s> does he not consider that instead of our giving the impression not only to hong kong but also to the whole world that we have let down the people of hong kongin this respect he should consider with his right honourable friend the clear possibility of limiting the right of residence to one generation and the limit of any immigration at all to a certain figure per year that we can well command and authorise <e> <s> finally is the noble lord not aware that this could be a proper condition for a british national overseas passport to contain <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter threw a remark at the opposition benches with his usual courtesy and clarity that the opposition seemed to wish to weaken this bill <e> <s> we made it very clear at the outset at second reading that we supported the bill in some of its sections and that we admired the government for bringing forward a measure to deal with the abolition of the all-pervading and not very wise section that had befuddled previous parliaments <e> <s> they at least have had the courage to grapple with it <e> <s> we were perfectly frank <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that at first instance it would appear that the noble lord lord renton has a very real point here if only from the point of view of clarity <e> <s> i must admit that i followed him very closely and it seemed to me that with his usual skill it was a well-lit argument with a proper conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and here i am borrowing partly the question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will he take it for granted for one moment that the information which it is sought to protect relates to a future incident where no member of the armed forces is going to be blown up none of their equipment is going to be blown up but a section of the public if i may use that phrase is going to be blown up <e> <s> all i ask for and i want to make it absolutely clear that it is all that the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton are asking for is this <e> <s> where in this bill is that secret covered <e> <s> where in this bill is that information covered <e> <s> if it were a fact that a civil servant reveals such information when the police are about to close in or the armed forces are about to take an initiative where is that covered <e> <s> one appreciates that the armed forces and their equipment are covered and one appreciates the interests abroad are covered but what about our citizens in this land in regard to such an incident <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not wish to rush the minister but we must get this matter clear <e> <s> the minister will find that clause is headed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is being completely courteous and reasonable until he reaches the stage when he refers to looking into the matter <e> <s> i anticipate that immediately following third reading someone i imagine that it will be the noble earl will propose the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i have a suggestion <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord renton will not think me discourteous <e> <s> this is his amendment it is not mine <e> <s> i am merely supporting it <e> <s> as the motion that the bill do now pass will not take very long to discuss would not the proper procedure be not to take the motion today but to take it on a date fairly soon so that the legislative programme is not interfered with <e> <s> the motion could be slotted in very easily as it will not take very long to debate <e> <s> there is no point in the noble earl saying that he will look into the matter after the bill has already been passed <e> <s> i therefore make that respectful suggestion to him in an endeavour to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> it may help everyone <e> <s> it is obvious that some of us <e> <s> are disturbed that the motion that the bill do now pass should proceed without a vital matter being studied <e> <s> i appreciate that no one wishes artificially or for any wrong reason to delay the passing of the bill <e> <s> it might be of convenience to the house and to those who are interested to see that something should be put right if the house were to adjourn so that that vital matter might be considered <e> <s> i wonder whether that view is accepted by the government benches <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may at once say that from our point of view we accept the suggestion with gratitude <e> <s> i have only one personal embarrassment which i wish to place before the house <e> <s> i should like to take part in the discussions but i am interested in the next bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord who will move the third reading of that bill and the motion that the bill do now pass will not think me discourteous if i am absent from my seat <e> <s> perhaps i may tell him in advance that i have no intention of opposing either the third reading or the passing of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house will be grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house for the explanation of what is an unusual procedure in your lordships house namely that the house be adjourned during pleasure so that two very important matters could be discussed <e> <s> as the noble lord the leader of the house has said one of those matters was the procedural point as to whether anything could be done on the basis that there was merit in the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> as the noble lord the leader of the house has said it was ruled that third reading having taken place nothing could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for that short concise and courteous description of this bill <e> <s> we have no observation to make except to thank the noble earl for the way in which he has presented it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us have welcomed the statement made by the commissioner of police for the metropolis that he intends to see that the police force has a different and welcome appearance so far as concerns the public <e> <s> would it not form part of a police endeavour throughout the country if instead of just cautioning reference was made to the way in which those habits could be cured by way of a direct introduction of offenders to such centres <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will permit me to repeat the question would it not be welcome if when coming across drunken offenders the police throughout the country quite apart from giving any caution were to be instructed to induce those people to go to the centres that we are discussing rather than leave it to local authorities which quite honestly do not necessarily come into contact with the people at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder how much of noble lords speeches in a debate dealing with the freedom of the press will be reported in the press of tomorrow <e> <s> i shall look with interest at such publications as are presided over by mr murdoch who appears to have featured individually in many of the speeches but not always to his credit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that much reliance has been placed by all those concerned on his assurance that he will be keeping an open mind on the proposals contained in the green papers and that he will be very ready to consider any counterproposals that coincide with the main aims which he seeks to perfect in those green papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that this is a monumental report consisting as it does of a report a draft bill of a most comprehensive nature and very full commentaries on the draft bill <e> <s> is it not a matter for very great congratulation whatever the governments thinking to mr justice beldam his fellow commissioners and all those who assisted him <e> <s> will not the government agree that the aim of the report and the bill namely to make criminal law more accessible comprehensible consistent and certain is a consummation devoutly to be wished <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the greatest possible sympathy with the noble viscount who has just moved his amendment <e> <s> i should like to remind the house of two things <e> <s> first it appears that the summer time order is a favourite matter in spite of its national interest for business at dinner time <e> <s> it was at dinner time last year that we discussed this order <e> <s> i commenced the remarks that i dared make to your lordships by saying this at col <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may congratulate him on his artistry in defending his department having taken over a year working on the survey <e> <s> i merely remind him that the department may learn a little lesson from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who gives the whole nation about three months in which to make observations on very fundamental green papers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on any one day there are estimated to be prisoners on remand in the prisons of england and wales who have been awaiting trial for more than six months <e> <s> is he also aware that it is estimated that of that figure more than have been awaiting trial for over a year <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is not a question of establishment and personnel but a question of the good name of the administration of justice in this country <e> <s> must not a programme therefore be outlined at least as a target in order that that critical and dreadful situation with regard to the figures that i ventured to quote ceases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will wish to express its appreciation to the noble earl for the clarity with which he explained this statutory instrument <e> <s> i wish that i could say that the statutory instrument itself deserves commendation <e> <s> indeed it does not <e> <s> i submit to the house that this is not only a retrograde step but a seriously wrong and in fact scandalous step when one realises just what is happening in our prisons in connection with remand prisoners generally <e>", "<cs> my lords so that there is no misunderstanding will the minister make clear in regard to the words of the noble lord lord wyatt in his supplementary question that it is hoped that the government will extend flexibility not only to top civil servants but also to top industrialists and commercial people <e> <s> will the noble lord make very clear that flexibility will extend to those who have shown loyalty to this country by their services and who also may have held their british citizenship for a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the national companies including the english national opera company are very much our countrys shop front in the artistic world as a whole is there not a case for special funding of those national companies whether through the arts council special fund or a government special fund <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the statement made only two days ago on tuesday th june by his colleague mr eggar at a meeting at the home office <e> <s> the statement was <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister referred so properly to the cheapness or comparative cheapness of the drug is he not aware that the chief danger is quite obviously to our children <e> <s> i am told that the drug can be obtained at a price of and possibly at an extreme price of <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble viscount and point out the fact that my name already appears on the speakers list <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hesitate before i intervene especially on a friday afternoon <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord who has just spoken and whose experience with the police we value in this house has really considered what the bill intends to do <e> <s> it intends to regulate the membership scheme so that those who are undesirable let there be no doubt about the public impression of this matter for one reason or another cannot be admitted to a football ground and cannot be admitted to membership of the scheme <e> <s> that is not the question that is normally within the policemans mind or the civilians mind who knows about these matters when it is a matter of joining a drinking club or any other kind of club <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will agree with the minister that sentencing is a matter for judges <e> <s> however where there is an absolutely scandalous situation as regards overcrowding of prisons does he not agree that it is the job of parliament to set out certain principles of policy <e> <s> does he not further agree that one of those principles of policy is the reduction of the time within which many remand prisoners stay in prison <e> <s> will he confirm that the figure of per cent <e> <s> of those offenders who are put on community order schemes together with probation order schemes successfully complete those schemes <e> <s> is that not an indication that those schemes ought to be expanded and used more often by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that members of the public will have noted the courtesy of the minister in apologising but does he believe that it is likely to restore their ruffled and almost tortured feelings about the delays which have taken place <e> <s> is it not a fact that there has now been offered to a reasonable union acting for the employees in the passport office an immediate increase of staff a review of the future staff requirements and an independent inquiry into the computer system and into facilities which are to be improved for both the public and the staff <e> <s> were not those proposals made two years ago by the union and repeated in this house <e> <s> why must the government invite strike action before making the present concessions thus saving the public all the inconvenience <e>", "<cs> my lords in this heavily political question despite what the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and others have said is it not a fact that too emphatic a cut-off in burglar alarms is more likely to assist burglars than neighbours <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the fact that parliament had discussed this matter many times <e> <s> would he care to remind his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that the house of commons after informed debate which is not available in a referendum four times over the past six years has produced substantial majorities against the idea of capital punishment <e> <s> in those circumstances does he agree that it would be a good idea to administer capital punishment to the subject itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl graciously corrected me on the question before last so will he accept this respectful correction <e> <s> i understand that acid is an american term for lsd <e> <s> i was so informed by a noble lord before i came to the house this afternoon <e> <s> that is the reference <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the remarks addressed to him is the minister aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl consider the advisability of making international arrangements so that at every airport and port both by way of embarkation and arrival there are clear notices in languages that would be understood by the people concerned that severe penalties including imprisonment await anyone who is detected as a carrier <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will forgive me if i return to this subject because i believe it is extremely important <e> <s> i was suggesting that notices on an international arrangement basis should be there before the courier leaves on the aircraft and also there when he arrives in this country <e> <s> therefore the warning will be particularly clearly given so that the courier knows exactly what the deterrent will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating one of the gravest statements ever made in this parliament of ours concerning the administration of justice in our country in respect of which we rightly have a very proud tradition <e> <s> there will be some measure of comfort in the fact that the secretary of state for the home office has had the courage to bring this matter out at this moment although some of us would have hoped it would happen before years and more had been served of these prison sentences <e> <s> i think too we would want to couple with that measure of comfort the courage of the present director of public prosecutions and that of the police who investigated this matter currently and who brought to light what had transpired in the past by those in the police force who appear to have let down the great tradition that our police have always had <e> <s> all praise is due to them for bringing to light what their colleagues who do not deserve that name appear to have done in this case <e>", "<cs> quite often when we have considered the consolidation of bills we have mentioned the committee of our members who together with those of another place make up the joint committee on consolidation bills <e> <s> as somebody who has sat on that committee perhaps i may say that it is not the most interesting committee of your lordships house <e> <s> however the members of it as i am not a member of it now i can say this with proper sincerity and modesty work extremely hard always under an able chairman who is either a law lord or a retired law lord <e> <s> it should be noted on this occasion that it is because of the care of the committee that the item mentioned by the noble and learned lord has come to light <e> <s> it is a perfectly proper point <e> <s> indeed had it been ignored it might well have led to difficulty later on <e> <s> i believe that for one moment we should pause and possibly think with gratitude of the work that is done by a not very glorious but extremely useful committee of this chamber and of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he recollect that some months ago at committee and third reading of the legal aid bill in response to an amendment that i had the privilege of moving the ministers noble and learned friend the lord chancellor said that these references would be considered <e> <s> this is an urgent matter which if grappled with will save administrative and judicial time <e> <s> the law commission for scotland has already accepted the reference <e> <s> will the minister inform his noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that one hopes that the english and welsh commission will follow the example of the scottish commission and speedily accept this reference <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the helpful suggestion made to the minister by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham that the government would always listen to substantial opinion expressed in the house and would then amend things and the ministers happy acceptance of that proposal may we take it that in future if the government receive a majority of or less on any amendment moved from these benches they will consider accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i regret my inability to ask a very intelligent supplementary question on this first question which was not asked perhaps i may ask the minister whether consideration has been given to the definition of young people in such a national register <e> <s> does the minister not agree that whereas it is very necessary and helpful to have a national register for children to have a register for missing young people for example over the age of who have left home deliberately and who do not wish to be traced by their parents might be very harmful and could embroil the police in difficulties of which they would like to be free <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may at once join with the minister in expressing appreciation to the noble lord lord nathan and the members of his committee for the wisdom that they have shown for the thoroughness that they have exhibited and for the speed with which they finished their report <e> <s> they were given their terms of reference and were appointed in july last year <e> <s> they succeeded in presenting their report which is now being debated by your lordships in months <e> <s> that is a meritorious accomplishment which may well be copied by future select committees of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> that does not make any difference to my argument if i may say so with respect <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord hailsham of all people infers that it makes a difference i should like to quote what is said in the report <e> <s> i regard it as very important <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why i apologised <e> <s> it must have been that i did not make my position clear <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat it because it is so important <e> <s> on one issue the committee forced uniformity against scottish evidence <e> <s> on the other issue which is so important namely the definition of murder it said that it does not matter if the definitions are different <e> <s> that was the point that i tried to make and i am sorry if i did not make it sufficiently lucidly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord forgive me if before he sits down i ask him a question out of fairness only <e> <s> does he accept that no one suggests a separate sentence for a terrorist or conviction of a terrorist when that does not apply to our present law <e> <s> would he agree that the scottish definition of murder would cover a terrorist <e> <s> i refer to the words in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it would be rather dreadful if north of the border someone were convicted of murder when on the same facts he would not be convicted south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i may be able to help him to come before the house in a white sheet especially in the absence of the noble and learned lord lord goff <e> <s> perhaps i may therefore be allowed to complete the quotation of which the noble and learned lord gave only half from what the noble and learned lord lord goff said on page <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he will deal with a point which i am sure he appreciates worries many of us <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice should obviously not have been quoted in his absence if i may say so with great respect as having been consulted and as having approved of the procedure when in his evidence on page he says <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is not just a question of it being desirable that families should be able to visit prisoners and prisoners see their families <e> <s> when trying to keep the family together that is about the one hope of some rehabilitation <e> <s> in those circumstances is it not quite disgraceful that the government are relying on voluntary contributions for a matter of this kind <e> <s> does the minister further agree that it is not just a question which concerns the prisons that happen to have been mentioned today namely manchester and brixton <e> <s> leeds prison is also in a dreadful position <e> <s> one of the officers described to me the situation when relatives turned up to visit prisoners as something like a zoo <e>", "<cs> my lords as well as the technical amendments to which the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i wonder whether we ought to be discussing a particular case <e> <s> i say that because if reported our discussion may be misinterpreted outside the house <e> <s> i believe that we are talking about a concept which is really the fundamental basis upon which the bill is built <e> <s> the only consideration perhaps i ought to use the word paramount is the welfare of the child in the particular circumstances which will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall support in a sentence or two what the noble lord lord renton has said because it is in line with previous protests which have been made in the house today about the absurdity of legislation which attempts to take it for granted that the public consists of a band of powerless idiots <e> <s> i say that not so much because of subsections and to which the noble lord lord renton referred but because if one looks at subsection even having regard to what the noble and learned lord said about the need to provide for the appointment of a specific officer one finds that it provides that if the probation officer is unable to carry out his duties or he dies someone else can be put in his place <e> <s> that is carrying things to an absurdity <e> <s> the house as the legislative body revising legislation should not allow such an example to pass without notice <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord lord renton for calling attention to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add only one more sentence <e> <s> it was not so much that i objected to subsection which talks about the arrangements that should be made for the selection and appointment of an officer but because vague words are used <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord realises that there is anxiety expressed in the house between the position of a power being given and it is obviously right that the power should be given and an expectation that the power will be exercised by some authorities which have not troubled to deal with this very important matter until now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has used the word undertaking <e> <s> i am more than happy and i believe that my noble friends will be also <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may herald with equal enthusiasm the victory of the noble lord lord mottistone and my defeat <e> <s> i believe that it was i who ventured to suggest the formula such a child in our earlier deliberations in this house <e> <s> we now have a very much better formula <e> <s> therefore i say that i herald my defeat with enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> my lords does it really mean that when the bill left this house abroad meant scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i propose to speak to both amendments no <e> <s> a and amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> there is so much unanimity if i may put it that way in your lordships house about the desirability of getting this measure on the statute book as soon as possible that i can announce before i say anything that if the noble and learned lord is unable to accept the amendment there is no question of the house being divided <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all those who have participated in the discussion <e> <s> we all want to achieve a proper end to this issue <e> <s> with regard to the observations made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale who is not in his seat perhaps i may paraphrase a biblical passage by saying that there is a time for precision in detail and a time for a general principle to be enunciated <e> <s> i believe that a time for precision in detail arises when a child is taken somewhere against the wishes or without the consent of a parent or carer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene for one moment before the noble lord rises <e> <s> i should like at once to say that i am sure that my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones will very much appreciate the kind reference that the noble and learned lord made about him and the way in which your lordships received it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord found any pleasure in sending me a letter perhaps i may tell him that i had even more pleasure in receiving it <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the problems which face the population in this country usually dealt with in this house by moderate language <e> <s> moreover do we not usually find that this is the better way to deal with such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords following as i do immediately after the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has spoken it gives me a pleasurable opportunity to express the deep respect that all of us on these benches have for him <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for every section of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> during the previous session when we discussed the children bill humanity came through clearly in the way that the noble and learned lord piloted the bill through the house <e> <s> when he came to discuss legal services he spoke with an imperturbability that was not always welcomed in every section of the house but nevertheless it was accompanied as always by constant courtesy <e> <s> we have just listened to another lucid speech from the noble and learned lord which i suppose for some of us merely proved again the worth of his advocacy if nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the opportunity of paying three tributes <e> <s> the first is to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who is known in this house as an introducer of interesting debates and as a valuable contributor on the subject of charities <e> <s> the second tribute was paid some time ago but i pay it again <e> <s> it is to the woodfield report which has been very largely followed in the recommendations made in the white paper <e> <s> the third tribute i pay to the minister who has just sat down for his picturesque metaphors of which i noted only a few <e> <s> he referred to anthills tulips dutch bulb fields and sharpening tools all in the course of one speech dealing with the not always attractive subject of charity law <e> <s> he also referred to mr jeffrey archer <e> <s> i am sure that if he had known i might have received some instructions to thank the noble lord for that reference <e>", "<cs> my lords if that was the only method of attracting my attention to the noble lords speech i would not have been so courteous to him as i always wish to be <e>", "<cs> my lords so that it is apparent that such activity does not exist on only one side of the house on many occasions i have also had the pleasure of acting as honorary solicitor to charities and carrying out the same good work as the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister introduced with his customary clarity and great ability this debate on a report which brings back as he said unforgettable and sombre memories of one of the blackest chapters in the whole of human history <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord but in view of his usual courtesy i am sure that he will not mind <e> <s> to enable some of us to understand his argument will he say whether he will tell the house that the homicide murder and genocide were not criminal acts at the time when they were committed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister informing the house that the home secretary is keeping an open mind on this matter the subject matter of the question and that it will not only be an open mind but a generous mind in regard to the police force <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to clarify one issue that i believe is worrying the house following on the question put by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> if the vietnamese government refuse to accept those who are forcibly repatriated what is going to happen to them if they are refused entry into vietnam <e> <s> is it the governments policy that there will be no forcible repatriation to vietnam if the vietnamese government refuse to accept refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister explain the mysterious words we shall adopt procedures that are in line with <e> <s> what are those procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords what are those procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that when a statement was made in this house on the critical situation which had arisen as a result of discoveries as to how the guildford four were wrongly convicted there was a clear voice in this house calling for the reform mentioned in this question <e> <s> will the minister explain to the house why we have to wait until the inquiry chaired by sir john may reports in as to what happened in that specific case of the guildford four <e> <s> why do we have to wait for that report in order to have precisely the same law as scotland has so satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i did not ask the question to which he gave a most courteous answer <e> <s> i was not inquiring as to why it was taking so long for sir john may to report <e> <s> i asked the minister whether we had to wait until before considering a general principle of law which is in scottish law <e> <s> why do we have to wait for that report before dealing with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister with his as ever attention to lucidity was gracious enough to let me have a copy of the memorandum with regard to the bill to which he referred <e> <s> i am deeply grateful to him for also supplying me with notes on clauses <e> <s> i hope that i have responded correctly to that courtesy by giving him notice of the various questions which arise from a perusal of the bill <e> <s> let me at once say what i believe is superfluous that all conceivable co-operation will come from these benches on matters of criminal investigation and trials on an international basis <e> <s> all conceivable co-operation too will come from these benches as i believe it will from every section of your lordships house when it comes to combating what i can only refer to as the murderous trade of drug trafficking <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for the lucidity of his explanation of as i believe he said this exotic but not exciting bill <e> <s> we should also admire his courage because i have an idea that he has a bad throat <e> <s> it was therefore very gallant of him to make his explantion as long as he did and we appreciate that <e> <s> i should also like to thank him and the government for their helpful attitude in attaching to the bill by way of schedules the three conventions concerned <e> <s> as he rightly said that is a great deal of use to practitioners and is a healthy example to follow in the future <e>", "<cs> almost binding the court and parties <e> <s> indeed the intervention that has just been

i think i used the word esoteric but i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> i do not intend that this matter should degenerate i believe that is the right word into a debate because he is being so kind in answering the questions <e> <s> is the minister prepared to answer this question or to consider it what is the point of a court deciding that there is a nullity or that a contract is void but being unable to deal with the consequences of that nullity <e> <s> the answer may be that the court does not have jurisdiction over the consequences <e> <s> that appears a very odd situation <e> <s> i apologise if i am talking nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter tabled his question he did not expect the answer which he received today <e> <s> can he confirm that it is not so much the result of pressure from on high or from whatever level it may have come that has produced this improvement but rather that the staffing requirements for which some of us asked have been largely fulfilled by way of an increase in staff <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that he is in very good form this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that a responsible spokesman from these benches intends to await the statement which is to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply conscious as all your lordships will be that had providence not otherwise decreed a figure very much loved and respected in all quarters of the house would at this juncture be addressing us on this important bill <e> <s> it is impossible for so many reasons to be an adequate substitute for the late lord elwyn-jones and i can only hope that with their usual kindness noble lords will bear with me <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble and learned lord will forgive me for interrupting him but he is dealing with the very important consideration of protection of the public <e> <s> as i understand it this bill will not contain a detailed account of the safeguards <e> <s> those will come afterwards in regulations <e> <s> therefore since this matter cannot be dealt with very easily at committee or report stage by way of amendments to the bill i ask the noble and learned lord whether he will undertake that the safeguards pointed out in the white paper as being necessary will not be watered down <e>", "<cs> my lords while immediately thanking the minister for his courtesy in repeating the statement perhaps i may make the position of those of us on these benches completely clear <e> <s> the security that could be given to the citizens of hong kong will come out of a proper bill of rights it will come out of a proper basic law <e> <s> what the government have put forward today is in our view completely inept and completely unjust <e>", "<cs> my lords it may very well seem that a minority of one did sound a correct note even if to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham it was a wrong one <e> <s> i rise again only to say that the first thing that i want to express by way of priority this afternoon is a feeling of confidence in the people of hong kong that fairness is being exercised in regard to the grant of a british passport and a right of residence <e> <s> it was because i saw that lack of fairness that i used language which the noble and learned lord described as intemperate <e> <s> if intemperate language is sometimes used because one feels that there is an injustice it is something of which the noble and learned lord has been guilty on many occasions in his past life <e>", "<cs> the last thing that i wish to do at the very commencement of committee stage is to find myself at variance with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i hope to persuade him that many just as important amendments are acceptable <e> <s> in view of what he has said i do not propose to attempt to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> but for the speech of the noble lord i had no intention at all of rising on this amendment at this stage <e> <s> i do so because

participant in this debate who was in some doubt <e> <s> i assure him that the wording of this subsection is not as clear as it obviously was to him <e> <s> if the wording had been <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask whether the noble and learned lord means to inform the committee that the words any enactment would not refer to an enactment which was passed after this bill giving therefore the power under this bill to alter vary or repeal that enactment <e> <s> does he say that it is an enactment which exists only as at the date at which we are speaking <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord would allow me one final observation all this discussion taking place at the instance of noble lords whose opinion in this house is much respected leads me again to repeat to the noble and learned lord that i am sure that his interpretation as he gives it at this moment is a very honest one and from the point of view of the language employed a very clear one <e> <s> perhaps i may tell him that there is doubt which can lead to all sorts of difficulties in the future if at report stage or at some stage when this bill is before your lordships house there be not made abundantly clear first of all the limitation of the order to be made under subsection and secondly the limitation on the powers of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor or any of his successors to deal with either future enactments or this enactment <e> <s> otherwise there is going to be doubt <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will only say that he will consider this as i believe he did say before with a view to clarifying the language and making matters abundantly clear he will have done a great service to the house <e>", "<cs> my aim in rising is twofold <e> <s> first i wish to try to be constructive with regard to the matters to which the noble and learned lord lord ackner referred <e> <s> the issue was very fully discussed at second reading with many examples given <e> <s> out of courtesy perhaps i may pay a tribute to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> he was kind enough to write to me on some matters that i raised at second reading <e> <s> i refer to matters that all of us regret are occurring and have occurred for some time in the county courts relating to personnel proper finance and general administration <e>", "<cs> i thought i detected a slightly illogical note in the arguments advanced against this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord ackner talked of the complications and complexities of libel law <e> <s> i am not sure that there are not many cases tried in the county court which require very much more legal experience and expertise so far as <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure that taking up the point would better my chances of getting the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish that the noble and learned lord had offered a more redoubtable defence to the amendment because then i should have no difficulty in accepting his assurance in regard to trying to put right the sorry present state of our county courts and crown courts <e> <s> i would then have accepted the situation quite placidly and would not have wanted to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to the noble and learned lord as will be all those who participated in the debate on the amendment <e> <s> we are grateful for his assurance that he regards it as beneficial that there should be a report <e> <s> i was looking for a report that contained a little more detail as to how part i was performing than the noble and learned lord originally mentioned <e> <s> he himself anticipated that that might be the desire <e>", "<cs> i should be extremely discourteous which i never want to be if i were not to accept what the noble and learned lord has just said <e> <s> but in his consideration would he mind taking into account that i believe those who have participated in the debate were looking for a report be it annually or biennially as he may consider fit which really told parliament and i emphasise the word parliament and accept the error of my ways in talking about the general public how far in effect part i had gone what the difficulties were and what was hoped to be achieved in order to get over those difficulties <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord would merely consider that i ask for no more between now and report stage i am sure that the proper course for me to take is to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i would be deemed impertinent if i asked the committee to view some of the speeches that have been made on clause stand part with a degree of common sense <e> <s> i believe that that plea was made by the noble baroness lady seear when she referred to hearing two eminent lawyers differ as to whether part i was a perfectly sensible and proper arrangement for subordinate legislation and another very learned lord speak in terms which suggested that there were <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is always amusing even at this time of night when it is much appreciated <e> <s> may i say in all frankness that

discourteous <e> <s> everything that he has said so far has nothing to do with this amendment but it might be extremely relevant to a debate on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i wish i could feel content with the noble earls courteous reply but i found it singularly unsatisfactory <e> <s> i wish to tell the committee why <e> <s> on every conceivable occasion where there has been a question of hitting at serious international crimes the government have had support from this dispatch box <e> <s> they have had support when they have sought extraordinary powers in regard to banks and in regard also to matters affecting personal liberty <e> <s> we have talked in terms of the confidentiality of banker and customer and have said that that has to be invaded in view of the universal threats of terrorism and drug offences <e> <s> from this dispatch box too i have ventured humbly to say that we must be careful to see that the floodgates argument does not apply that once having allowed certain things to happen in our criminal law we stop short of things which otherwise will come rushing through by way of alteration to old traditional and valuable concepts <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> in view of the assurance given even though it was given in somewhat guarded language which i appreciate he had to use i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> do we have to be as pedantic as it seems we are in subsection of the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the subsection says <e>", "<cs> because i know him to be an honest man i take the noble earls word for it that this was exactly the answer he was going to give even if the noble and learned lord lord hailsham had not intervened <e> <s> i recognise fully that there are different standards of evidence in scotland as well as different types of pleas <e> <s> but if scotland has the terminology sufficient evidence and we wish to say that it will be sufficient evidence in the united kingdom if that certificate is given why can we not use the one terminology that it shall be sufficient evidence in both countries <e>", "<cs> i may be making this point out of sheer ignorance but should there not be a definition of a colony in view of the way in which independence is given to almost every one of the constituent parts of what was our empire <e> <s> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> this is only a small point but perhaps the noble earl will be good enough to consider it <e> <s> paragraph of the amendment states that the enforcement officer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has the respect and affection of every member of the house <e> <s> i am sure that he will not think me discourteous if i say that one possible reason for the delay in getting through the provisions of the bill is speeches of the length of the noble and learned lords speech on the mere subject of how much time we are taking <e> <s> i say that with deep respect <e>", "<cs> i agree with every word said by the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> i prefer the wording of my amendment for the very reason which he gives <e> <s> i shall move amendment no <e> <s> when my turn arises <e>", "<cs> having regard to what the noble and learned lord just said and in the circumstances i wonder whether he could simply accept the amendment i propose <e> <s> i would hope that he do so and thereby the first acceptance by the government of an amendment could be recorded <e> <s> it would make the government appear in a very reasonable light if having agreed with everything said in regard to this amendment the noble and learned lord accepted it <e>", "<cs> i tried to make this point on the first day in committee and perhaps the committee will bear with me if i make it again <e> <s> this part of the bill has been heralded as a way of making our procedures in court and our trials shorter in duration quicker to come on and more economical in the course of the trial procedure <e> <s> the noble and learned lord deserves the thanks and praise of all of us for attempting to do that <e>", "<cs> on matters of principle such as this i consider that the committee should state its view <e> <s> i say with the deepest respect that where the <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that members of the committee will not think it too dramatic if i say that an opportunity has been lost <e> <s> how different is the reply given today by the noble and learned lord from the speech that he made on the first day of committee <e> <s> referring to the civil justice review he said <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the courtesy of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i wish to see whether there is a sympathetic symphony which will now be played by the committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord continues the argument could be shortened if both parties agreed as to what was being said <e> <s> as i understood the noble and learned lord he talked in terms of this being guidance <e> <s> is he aware that subsection reads <e>", "<cs> i say with deep respect that the noble and learned lord might have been wiser merely to give the same wide discretion to the county court judges to make orders as to costs without limiting in this rather misleading way their powers in regard to orders against certain parties <e> <s> we should have enough faith in the county court judges to give them an absolute discretion without telling them that they may only award costs against various people <e>", "<cs> i am glad that we have had this debate <e> <s> it has been extremely useful as have the remarks of the noble and learned lords lord ackner and lord hailsham <e> <s> i said that it might be sensible to leave discretion where it is governed by the case law to which the noble and learned lord lord ackner referred <e> <s> i was merely drawing attention to what appeared to be a dangerous provision <e> <s> i observed that the only example given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was to my mind a highly dangerous one where someone gives evidence which seems to support the plaintiffs case and which is given in bad faith query the order for costs <e> <s> this is a provision which talks about supporting the bringing of the proceedings not supporting the proceedings at trial whether or not financially <e> <s> it appears that the whole of subsection ought to be looked at again <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was gracious enough to say that he would reconsider the provision in the light of todays debate <e> <s> in those circumstances but with some pleasure that i brought the matter forward i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i intend to take the course which i previously indicated and which the noble and learned lord correctly repeated <e> <s> i say in answer to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i was careful in the amendment to limit the immunity of trade unions or professional associations to cases which i should have thought would have met even with his approval that is where a trade union or professional association helps a member in respect of proceedings for personal injury or for breach of contract of employment and also where it assists dependents with a claim in regard to a members death <e> <s> i should have thought that with those limitations i would have received the support of the noble lords heart <e> <s> however i presume that his mind has overruled his heart on this occasion <e>", "<cs> it is not a relationship which covers all professional associations although i wish that every one of them would support my party <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise with the noble and learned lord one question which puzzles me <e> <s> it may be as a result of my ignorance although i have looked at the notes on clauses and cannot find a solution to my problem <e> <s> the point lies in subsection <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that rather than putting a figure of this percentage in the clause and having to rely upon a statutory instrument which not only takes the time of parliament if parliament cares to discuss it but incurs some other costs of a not minimal size it would have been much more sensible to have left it again to the discretion of the court <e> <s> i see no point in the minimum <e> <s> however having made the point during discussion on clause stand part i ask the noble and learned lord to be kind enough at least to consider it <e>", "<cs> i apologise for popping up again on clause stand part but it strikes me that there is something a little misleading in the marginal note <e> <s> the noble and learned lord used the expression exchange of witness statements <e> <s> the clause provides that the court may direct any party to civil proceedings to serve on the other parties a written statement <e> <s> one can well see that in certain circumstances the court may only order one party to do this <e> <s> the marginal note again refers to exchange of witness statements as though the order could only be made by way of exchange <e> <s> in other words both parties have to receive the order <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would care to comment in order to clarify the matter and make sure that the marginal note of exchange of witness statements is not inaccurate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say first how delighted i am to be able to agree with the noble and learned lord lord ackner and how much i appreciate the comparatively moderate tones in which he spoke <e> <s> i am sure that that moderation will apply whichever part of the bill we discuss <e>", "<cs> we were all impressed by the experience of the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls who has our great respect <e> <s> we emphasised as did another of his colleagues the way in which the rules committee acts and the personnel involved <e> <s> can he inform the committee how often the rules committee meets and is it a fact that it has not met for two years <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord accept from my presumption that i should not have obtained leave to appeal from him had i tried and secondly that i knew the answer to the question which is why i asked it <e>", "<cs> i was going to raise this point under clause stand part <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lords lord ackner and lord wilberforce for making the point and to the noble lord lord renton for helping with some suggested phraseology <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i appreciate the fact that the noble and learned lord thought we were trying by way of this amendment and the worthy speech of the noble lord lord meston to help him overcome a difficulty in which he might otherwise find himself <e> <s> as the noble lord lord meston said <e>", "<cs> i too support the spirit of the amendment of the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> we thought that paragraph g of amendment no <e> <s> which i promise the committee i shall not move was rather more appropriate in that it allowed an order to be made specifying circumstances in which a county court may refuse to hear an authorised person <e> <s> in that event the correct language can be used to cover all those matters <e>", "<cs> very briefly i want to say that the noble and learned lord lord ackner is absolutely right when he asks the committee to be realistic <e> <s> it is all very well to give rights of representation to various categories of people <e> <s> i am all in favour of it if it will help people to have justice administered to them when they cannot speak for themselves and cannot afford other representation or do not find it suitable <e>", "<cs> far be it for me to call anybody to order <e> <s> i suppose that i am usually a sinner myself <e> <s> but i understand that amendment no <e> <s> has not yet been called and amendment no <e> <s> alone has been called <e> <s> i rise to say that by arrangement with the noble lord lord hacking i was due to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore i have been waiting for an opportunity to do so <e> <s> obviously i have listened to what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> the last thing that i want to do is to extend the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i have heard what the noble and learned lord has said with distinct pleasure <e> <s> maybe it would be very helpful if when amendment no <e> <s> is called i could utter one sentence which might assist him <e>", "<cs> that is good enough for me <e>", "<cs> the last thing in the world i want is to create trouble for the committee or to be a party to it <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> on that basis and at this stage i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be of use if at this stage and having regard to the speech of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson i were to state the view of those on these benches in regard to the whole of part ii <e> <s> it might lead to economy of speeches later <e>

professional pain because i heard a fine advocate admired so much in my profession for his advocacy make the mistake if i may say so of so over-stating his case that he lost the jury <e>", "<cs> may i say that a solicitor advocate would have thought that he was wasting the time of the high court if he had made any of these points <e>", "<cs> i must make my position entirely clear in order to protect the dignity of my side of the profession <e> <s> the noble and learned lords answer was that in certain circumstances something which is new cannot possibly be compared with anything that has been previously the practice by virtue of the fact that it is entirely new <e> <s> if you have the word development as you have in clause before the word new i should have thought that it was perfectly proper to have the alternative <e>", "<cs> as an individual member of this committee what the noble lord lord alexander said is completly acceptable as a principle namely that if a solicitor advocate presumably wearing his wig and gown stands by the side of his barrister collegue similarly attired as a principle they should be bound by precisely the same rules of conduct <e> <s> i pray that one day there will be a joint bar and law society code of conduct regarding advocates <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> i always listen with great respect to the noble lord lord campbell but <e>", "<cs> i should just like to raise one small point <e> <s> there are two misprints in clause that at least ought to be noted <e> <s> in the fourth line of subsection the word proision is hardly the correct word nor is the word proviing in the fifth line <e> <s> i only draw attention to those misprints so that the corrections can be made in the bill before it reaches report stage <e>", "<cs> after the serious note that was struck by the noble and learned lord lord ackner may i say what an entertaining exercise it would be if any of the designated judges were in fact sued for damages whom they would chose to represent them under the cab-rank rule <e> <s> but having said that i cannot seriously think that any member of your lordships committee would wish to see and i am sure that this applies to the noble and learned lord a designated judge liable for damages in the exercise of his duties <e> <s> i should hope therefore that this amendment would be speedily accepted and passed <e>", "<cs> not if the business of the committee is carried out with reasonable despatch <e>", "<cs> i shall immediately answer the challenge of the noble lord lord beloff and others who have asked

reaction to speeches of that kind smiled at me with some indulgence <e> <s> i did not take that to be an acceptance of all that i said but he did not say what the noble and learned lord the master of

encourage this generally but i was looking at the membership of the advisory committee itself in order to see that that principle was carried through <e> <s> maybe the noble and learned lord in his great kindness would write to me between this stage and report <e> <s> we can either agree then upon something to be put in the bill or i can move my amendment at report stage and have it considered <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord refers to the good work of these services committees and says that a body is pursuing this with vigour i refer him to the record of the debate to which he referred <e> <s> it was on th january which is now over two years ago <e> <s> when my noble and learned and much lamented friend lord elwyn-jones moved an amendment for this to be dealt with under the legal aid act the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on th january said <e>", "<cs> it is indeed a grain of comfort and at this stage i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to maintain my patience throughout these long proceedings <e> <s> but i say with all due respect to the committee and to the noble and learned lord when the advisory committee has to undertake a job of this nature and tender advice to which regard must be paid by the professional bodies it will look at the powers which it has been given <e> <s> under the schedule the members of such a committee are not given powers to commission research they are not given the funds to pay for it and they are not given the means to pay for the expenses connected therewith <e>", "<cs> that is a harsh reply and completely untypical of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we must all be affected by the lateness of the hour <e> <s> i say that because i know that if i had pleaded with <e>",

"<cs> with such help i believe the noble and learned lord could do without if the committee will forgive the english of that expression <e> <s> as i said before i wonder whether in view of the exclusion which presumably every professional body will have to have to any advice given upon any other matter the noble and learned lord might consider that the provision is a little odd and that the wording might be rather different <e> <s> however if he persists in his view i shall have to take a certain course <e> <s> i hope he will make an observation on what i have just said <e>", "<cs> in view of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i add an observation only to assist the noble and learned lord <e> <s> there are many professional bodies which include those words deliberately so that they can discipline a member for a professional offence committed during his membership <e> <s> however the complaint may be dealt with only after the member has resigned from that professional body <e> <s> usually the provision is included in order not to rob the ombudsman and much worse the complainant before him of his rights to look into a matter <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i thought that this would be an exceptional case but if the noble and learned lord would consider for example a writ being issued and an appearance being entered and then no statement of claim delivered for some time a defendant in those circumstances could apply to the court for the action to be struck out <e> <s> but months could elapse before anything like that was effected <e> <s> in the meantime and in the very special case hardship could be caused to the complainant <e>", "<cs> i did not quite understand what the noble and learned lord said and i am sure it is my fault <e> <s> on the last occasion i did not understand whether he was seeking a formula which would be incorporated in this bill or whether he was seeking one which might lead to an amending act <e>", "<cs> and which i was going to move <e> <s> i am very interested in this matter <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can give an indication as to the course he proposes to take <e> <s> if he is not ready with his own proposals on this matter at report stage in order to bring it to a final conclusion it would not be helpful to table an amendment <e> <s> however if the noble and learned lord felt that a government amendment could be tabled by third reading and there is an undertaking to that effect one would wait until then <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord does not think it unhelpful i was considering returning with the amendment at report stage in the hope that if he did not accept it he would have one in substitution <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment i do not intend to repeat all the good reasons that were advanced so eloquently by the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> i merely add another reason for submission to the committee which is that one of the main reasons for setting up the crown prosecution service with which everyone in this chamber agreed was that there should be an effective service independent of the police which would make judgments on a professional basis <e> <s> we thought that such judgments would therefore be seen to be fair as well as we hoped actually being fair <e> <s> it requires a great deal of courage even if a clerk had the necessary experience to go against the view of the police that bail should be opposed <e> <s> it needs a professional man with professional experience and knowledge to make that important decision <e> <s> i add that as another reason to the many cogent reasons which were advanced by the noble lords lord hutchinson of lullington and lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> would the noble and learned lord agree that whereas an authorised body is defined in the bill that is not true of a recognised body <e> <s> i may be wrong about that and if so i apologise to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> even if it is so defined is he quite sure that a recognised body would not cover the crown prosecution service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for his courtesy in repeating the <e>", "<cs> i rise because of the implication that appears to be part of this case namely that if you are an employee-lawyer you lose your judgment integrity and independence <e> <s> if i were a doctor i would resent it if it were assumed that because i was an employee-doctor i had less independence as regards the advice that i gave or the ability with which i behaved as a doctor <e> <s> we must be very careful before we go down that road <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord telling the committee which thank heavens consists of members of professions and callings other than lawyers that the fact that a judge happened to see counsel very often and that therefore i suppose a friendship might ensue would in the slightest degree affect the mind of the judge in the way that he summed up to a jury <e> <s> if that is what he believes all i can say is that it is not my picture of a judge <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls will forgive me if i say at once that i wish that he had continued his studies at the bar because he would have adorned the profession had he been called <e> <s> had he gone on with his studies and read a little about licensing law he would have known i say this with deep deference that the job of the licensing justices has nothing to do with criminal offences or the trial of them <e> <s> the question is merely whether licences should be granted <e> <s> in such cases one has experience on both sides of saying to the magistrates i think that the licence should be granted or i think that the licence should not be granted <e> <s> that has nothing to do with prosecuting or defending <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say with great respect that the committee stage of the bill is hardly likely to progress if speeches repeating arguments advanced on second reading continue <e> <s> i have previously referred to the noble and learned lord lord simon in terms of the respect and affection in which he is held but his speech was a second reading speech <e> <s> because he made it because the committee listened and because as the noble lord lord hutchinson mentioned papers like the <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits own may i take it that the fact that he has not commented on the reply that he gave to my amendment as to solicitors being high court judges is admitted by him to be a correct paraphrase of what he said <e>", "<cs> i share the amusement of the committee <e> <s> however i wish to remind the noble and learned lord that my gentle criticism was directed towards the fact that he made a speech on the question of how long we ought to be speaking <e> <s> he wanted that time to be shortened but the speech that he made on the subject was very long <e> <s> the speech that i made later concerned a new clause <e>", "<cs> i believe that there are certain proceedings where a solicitors clerk can attend before the master namely in regard to a claim for damages and the assessment of damages where the proceedings are not technically heard in chambers but in open court <e> <s> that is only a procedural matter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord may care to look into that situation because of the words in chambers in the high court <e> <s> i shall raise this matter on clause stand part <e> <s> that is a present ability of the solicitors clerk to be heard by the master <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble and learned lord has undertaken to look at the point that i have raised <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee will agree with me that it would be economical of time if i were to speak to my amendments nos <e> <s> t to y without moving them at this stage because those amendments concern the very provisions which we are talking about in schedule <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord prys-davies is here <e> <s> i am sure that when the other noble lords have read what i have had to say regarding the amendment they will have an opportunity at another stage of the bill to express a view if it happens to be contrary to mine <e>", "<cs> this is not the only time when the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson not in a ceremonial way but in another way has voiced an opinion which is not necessarily the correct one <e> <s> my party has adumbrated its policy of reforming the house of lords <e> <s> whether all of us agree with the announcement of the policy is another matter <e> <s> i hope that in any such reformation the dignified role of lord chancellor would play a part <e>", "<cs> i have not moved the amendment therefore it is difficult for me to withdraw it <e> <s> however i should like to be permitted the courtesy of answering immediately <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord will forgive me from the height of the eloquence and advocacy of the noble lord lord hutchinson and the model of moderation of the noble and learned lord lord ackner perhaps i may try to bring the committee down to what i believe from my experience really happens <e>", "<cs> i answer that very briefly by saying that my experience over the years is that the county courts are full of solicitors who exercise their rights of audience <e> <s> that is true of all the metropolitan county courts and i should have thought from what i hear from my colleagues that is also true of the county courts in the provinces <e>", "<cs> may i say how sensible this amendment is <e>", "<cs> i wish to add briefly to what the noble lord lord boardman has said <e> <s> i shall not repeat anything he has said much of which i agree with <e> <s> i also agree heartily with much of what the noble lord lord rippon said <e> <s> however i wonder whether the argument that the noble lords advanced namely that the purchase and sale of a home are possibly the most important acts that a member of the public in many cases indulges in is not the very reason why a minister of an elected government in safeguarding the public should not make the appointment in this case rather than a judge <e> <s> i say that with all due respect to judges <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would again be economical as regards time if i were to speak now to amendment no <e> <s> d although i shall obviously not move it at this stage <e> <s> i wish to do so because it has exactly the same object as the amendment moved by the noble lord lord evans except that it provides that this supervision necessity for unqualified staff should be in primary legislation as it is in regard to solicitors and licensed conveyancers <e>", "<cs> i wish to give some examples of how misleading this subsection is at the moment <e> <s> it speaks clearly about there being no ability of the law society or the bar council to prevent their members from being employed by authorised conveyancers <e> <s> with that object the law society and i am sure the bar council would have no quarrel if it were clearly pointed out that this is the limit of what is desired <e> <s> however the language is not so clear <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have heard what the noble and learned lord said as have other members of the committee <e> <s> he has recognised the fact that it is an important matter <e> <s> i believe that in protecting the public it will be of great help to him if the matter is made clear in the primary legislation <e> <s> that was the reason for my detailed amendment containing the clause which i proposed should be inserted if it was agreed <e>", "<cs> i must confess to be unhappy with the noble and learned lords reply but obviously at this hour of the night it would be foolish to continue the debate <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment reserving the right to return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i cannot help thinking that the ombudsman could in fact deal with all manner of complaints including those against solicitors and licensed conveyancers <e> <s> however it is deemed necessary to have a statutory provision specially providing for such a situation <e> <s> if i may say so with the greatest respect i am somewhat surprised that the noble and learned lord has not sought to introduce this clear power for the board which would have precisely the same effect and ensure an analogous and tidy situation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will be grateful we on these benches certainly are for the assurance of the noble and learned lord that there will be an amendment at report stage which makes the making of regulations including regulations under clause subject to the affirmative procedure <e> <s> i thank the noble and learned lord for that assurance <e>", "<cs> although not using again the phrase cross-subsidising i am sure that the noble and learned lord will have that very thought in mind when he considers what is fair and proper and will safeguard the public <e> <s> in view of the very fair assurance that he has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no wish to enlarge this debate beyond reason <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble and learned lord realises that the point made by the noble earl lord selkirk is very real and practical <e> <s> i say with deep respect that very largely we are living in a dream world <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord has said that he has sought advice on the matter that he has the power in his view to make regulations covering the specific matters mentioned in the amendment and that he agrees with the spirit of what is proposed it would be quite wrong for me to press the matter to a vote <e> <s> i have accepted from what he said and i hope properly so that we have an assurance from him that the provisions of this amendment are very much in his mind <e> <s> i understand that he feels that he has the power under clause to make a regulation covering the matters contained in the amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should not dream of wasting the time of the committee <e> <s> having regard to the clear statement of the noble and learned lord that the qualifications under paragraph b will be clearly laid down in regulations that they will be those of a solicitor licensed conveyancer or member of the conveyancing bar and that those qualifications are also intended to apply to paragraph c i shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that clarification <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the observations of the noble lord lord coleraine which as always are intended to be helpful <e> <s> i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to add a couple of sentences <e> <s> the noble and learned lord and many members of the committee will know that very strong representations have been made by the law society not for its own good or for the good of its membership but because of its worries about the very points that the noble and learned lord has just made <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will permit me and if the committee will be indulgent i shall endeavour to point out to her that although in england and wales it is the rule of practice that solicitors are not normally permitted to act for vendor and purchaser they can do so if both are long-standing clients of the firm <e> <s> that exception does not operate if the solicitor believes that there is the slightest chance of a conflict of interest <e> <s> if he believes that there is such a chance the exception does not apply <e> <s> if knowing of the conflict he continues to act for vendor and purchaser he will be acting wrongly and unprofessionally <e>", "<cs> perhaps i disturb the noble and learned lord in the middle of his statement if so i shall sit down at once <e> <s> however if he has concluded his thoughts on this matter for the guidance of the committee because i am sure that he knows the situation i raise this point <e> <s> independent solicitors find themselves acting for a client on a prospective purchase <e> <s> as regards a number of building societies there is a roll of solicitors of whom they have had experience and whom they are prepared to see act for them although of course they realise that they are giving that permission not to solicitors acting regularly for them but to an independent solicitor whose client is the purchaser <e> <s> quite obviously they run the risk that the main loyalty is automatically owed to the client <e> <s> they are merely the solicitor authorised to act for them because they appear on a roll of solicitors <e> <s> that in no way compares in loyalty or duty or to the practicalities of somebody who is employed by the building society <e>", "<cs> having regard to that very clear reply and the intention of the noble and learned lord to regulate on precisely the lines of the amendment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the very clear statement made by the noble and learned lord i ask leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respectfully tell the noble and learned lord why i am in some difficulty and i hope that he will understand my position <e> <s> the ambiguous wording of the white paper causes me some problems because in the white paper the statement is made that <e>", "<cs> i obviously do not want to indulge in cross-conversation of any length with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> but as this is a consultation on principle and not a consultation on the wording of any regulation does he intend to have those consultations during the various stages of this bill in this chamber so that at all events by the end of report stage we should have an opportunity to have a statement from him which at least would enable us to say what the principle ought to be when we reach third reading <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble and learned lord is trying to help me <e> <s> he will not think me in the slightest degree discourteous if i say that he has only gone a very small distance down the path to helping me <e> <s> what i believe is so essential is that the principle of not only disclosing but accounting for commissions which solicitors have to do and i am limiting it to that should be the rule in regard to <e>", "<cs> it is a great shame <e> <s> i thought that i had opened a door that the noble and learned lord could have entered with ease <e> <s> however unless he can reconsider his statement he has given me no alternative but to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i briefly say that in general terms we support the amendment <e> <s> however there is one respect in which i ask the noble and learned lord to consider whether there is an omission here that i tried to cover in amendment no <e> <s> b which is now past history <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble and learned lord will not think me facetious at this hour if i ask a perfectly serious question <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton has made a point as regards an issue which is hurting many professional people <e> <s> if anybody had told the noble and learned lord during his distinguished career as an advocate in scotland that he was a trader what would have been the effect of that remark on him <e>", "<cs> with that last observation i would not only agree but i should like to take the opportunity of congratulating the noble and learned lord not only on his agility of mind when he stands on his feet which all of us are noticing but on the physical endurance that he shows in going through very long hours on the committee stage of this bill retaining his courtesy throughout and a clarity of mind that is the envy of most of us <e> <s> it was possibly with that in view that i hated the idea of anyone ever inferring that in the course of his brilliant legal career he was called a trader <e>", "<cs> having regard to what the noble and learned lord has been pleased to say i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be that when i move the next amendment which deals with specifying what the regulations should cover my point will be met <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i follow the full impact of the question of the noble lord lord boardman <e> <s> was his query connecting the quality of regulation that the law society would exercise on those who were conducting probate work with what i am now trying to provide in the amendment or did i misunderstand what he said <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> it is to be hoped that that would be so <e>", "<cs> i once introduced and the noble and learned lord did not object to it the adjective favourable before consideration <e> <s> i assume that the consideration will be equally favourable on this occasion <e> <s> on that assumption i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for that courtesy <e> <s> in those circumstances i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which i shall have to consider with my noble friends and those who have made representations to us <e> <s> we shall see where we stand at a further stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i urge the committee to exercise the caution that should undoubtedly be exercised when dealing with the question of lawyers costs conditional fees and contingency fees <e> <s> i appear to have caused some merriment <e> <s> i am talking about a very serious subject and one that affects the public very greatly <e>", "<cs> i have waited until the noble and learned lord finished an argument <e> <s> i would not wish to be in any way confused but so far he has spoken about contingency fees which many of us recognise as being an evil <e> <s> is not this clause directed to the conditional fees and not contingency fees <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> after that usual eloquent speech of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham who mentioned as the main background of his argument the issue of morals i wonder whether i might put a few thoughts to your lordships <e> <s> i do so with very great respect <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has anticipated the last part of my speech but she has put it very much more shortly <e> <s> i am grateful to her and i shall try to remember her words when i utter the last part of my remarks <e>", "<cs> i have considered that position as carefully as i can <e> <s> i hope that i am not being over-optimistic when i say that i have taken it for granted that the grant of rights of audience to laymen coming from outside the professions of both solicitors and barristers will be so limited that i shall not have to be concerned with the matter <e> <s> that is the view that most people have taken when they bear in mind the eminence of those who have to decide upon the rules relating to rights of audience <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord finally sits down i have put to him i hope in clear and fair terms that i hoped he would accept amendment no <e> <s> a when it was moved <e> <s> i understood him to say that he accepted the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> if he could kindly give me his assurance that that amendment will be accepted when it is moved i shall know where i stand <e> <s> if he does not i do not know where i stand <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e>", "<cs> i refuse to use the words contingency fee because that is not the phrase which occurs in the bill <e> <s> it is not a phrase i shall use it is not a phrase which i should have supported in the division lobby <e> <s> the amendment is not to be deemed to be in substitution of legal aid <e> <s> when an applicant for legal aid appears before the legal aid authority or his application is dealt with the fact that this sort of arrangement may have been entered into should not be taken into account at all by the legal aid authority <e> <s> that is all that the amendment says that is all that it is meant to say <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble and learned lord will consider the words or ought to have been although i cannot see any harm in them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give an example i hope that the noble and learned lord will find it fitting because we have spoken so much about personal injury cases <e> <s> let us take for granted that a plaintiff is knocked over by a car which has mounted the pavement and the driver is drunk <e> <s> that person goes to a solicitor for help <e> <s> the solicitor applies for legal aid <e> <s> without this amendment the board might conceivably say but you know this is just a case of the matter speaking for itself <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will forgive me for saying that i am still in the position where i thought that my argument for the amendment was abundantly clear <e> <s> it is not that the legal aid board might say that legal aid is obviously preferential <e> <s> it is to stop the legal aid authority saying to an applicant but do you realise that there is another course open to you <e> <s> have you discussed it with your solicitor or has your solicitor discussed it with you because that should be a matter for consideration and you should not trouble the legal aid fund <e> <s> in this amendment i am setting down a provision to stop any such question or discussion <e>", "<cs> the last thing in the world i want is the importation of the word reasonably <e> <s> i want that to be completely out of the discussion when the legal aid board considers these applications reasonably or unreasonably <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to explain to the noble baroness in simple language two reasons why a somewhat illogical-looking rule must apply for the public good <e> <s> the first one is that if there were no such rule in order to protect himself the advocate would have to quote every point that might have been made in a brief and worse still every point that a client has asked him to put forward even though the barrister knows perfectly well that to put forward some of those points might be inimical to the interests of the client <e> <s> that is the first reason among many <e>", "<cs> i must not jump up and down <e> <s> i promise the committee that this is the last time i shall jump up <e> <s> after this i shall sit down <e> <s> however i was dealing with the phrase contemplated proceedings <e> <s> even if this measure now extends to a body of people whom we would not have contemplated but for the bill i was asking whether in any circumstances advocacy could or should cover from a practical point of view contemplated proceedings <e> <s> that means proceedings which have not been started yet <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord clarify the point about contemplated proceedings if only to put me in my place <e>", "<cs> i rise for the last time and i do it only in order to extend what i have said and not to repeat what i have said <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord will consider as he always does the fact that these acts of parliament are read by lay people who ought to be able to understand them <e> <s> no layman who read clause not knowing the abstruse ruling that was given in the cases to which the noble and learned lord referred in regard to the immunity rule would understand that contemplated proceedings came within the immunity rule which deals with advocates who are dealing with the matter at a trial <e> <s> it may very well be that the immunity rule needs to be spelt out more clearly in the bill or that some alteration has to be made to the wording <e> <s> i merely ask the noble and learned lord to consider the matter before report stage <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is always welcome in this chamber whether he <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble and learned lord has just said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be convenient to the committee it would certainly save time if i were to address noble lords on amendments nos <e> <s> b and c because the matters with which we are now dealing are dealt with by those amendments <e> <s> anyone who has read those amendments will wonder why there are two amendments which say the same thing <e> <s> reflection made it apparent that amendment no <e> <s> c was better worded <e> <s> i therefore ask noble lords to consider only that amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the word may should be substituted for the word shall <e> <s> does he remember his own words namely that he would wish to see the multi-professional association prohibited <e>", "<cs> i started my speech and i am sorry if i was not sufficiently clear by saying that it might be thought that we did not have to worry about this matter because the noble and learned lord might say as he said previously in regard to another amendment which affected the bar that the law society does not have to enable multi-professional associations to exist <e> <s> therefore why not give the law society that power <e> <s> i then went on to say that the reason is that we are in danger if that is done that the director general of fair trading if there is not a statutory prohibition as i have tried to make it and that is why i use the word shall not could challenge the law society and on the ground of economic criteria say i am awfully sorry but you are acting in an anti-competitive way <e> <s> you have been enabled by an act of parliament to permit these things <e> <s> why are you not doing that <e>", "<cs> i rise only to save time on the amendments when i move them <e> <s> there are occasions and i say this with the utmost respect to the noble and learned lord when his agility of mind supersedes his willingness to concede an obvious point <e> <s> i hope that this is not going to be one of those occasions <e> <s> has one ever heard of a body generously given power by the noble and learned lord which declines to accept it unless it be for very good reason <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is talking of giving power to the law society in order to make it possible for it to include multi-disciplinary practices which are now prohibited by statute <e> <s> i can tell the noble and learned lord that the law society does not want that power <e> <s> while it appreciates his generosity the law society tells him in no uncertain terms please do not give it to us <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may turn a conversation between the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and myself to one between myself and the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls <e> <s> i say this with deep deference but he has overlooked the provisions of the administration of justice act which permit incorporated practices <e> <s> one could therefore have a limited company with the <e>", "<cs> in view of the importance of this matter to my profession i have no hesitation in saying that it is the duty of this committee and i put it most respectfully not to behave recklessly in regard to what may or may not be the future activity of the director of the office of fair trading or future legislation <e> <s> in protection of the traditions of my profession i not only move the amendment but in the circumstances i wish to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> obviously i did not say it very clearly but i said that those who were appointed to the circuit bench did not come within the ten-year rule <e> <s> i made that abundantly clear <e> <s> but there are many talented solicitors who would not find it a natural course to go through the circuit bench <e> <s> if i may respectfully say so the noble and learned lord is depriving the high court bench of that talent <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of appetite but of supplying need <e> <s> that is what i am addressing my mind to <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord ackner was a very fine advocate in his time as i had occasion <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls for introducing the transitional point <e> <s> and to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for agreeing to consider the matter on that aspect <e> <s> i hope that he may even widen his consideration and take in some of the comments that i ventured to make <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is also right to say that an arbitrator has complete power if a defence has not been filed to hear the claim or the counterclaim <e>", "<cs> i rise at once in support of this very sensible amendment <e> <s> with great respect i also bring to the attention of the committee that it is not just the practitioners who sometimes produce a case in which there is prejudice to both parties by virtue of the length of time taken in the action coming on to trial <e> <s> it ought to be known to the committee and i am sure that the noble and learned lords the master of the rolls and the lord chancellor know it that if an action is set down for trial now in the queens bench division or indeed in the chancery division one will be told that there is no chance of that case being heard until <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he will have noticed i hope that i quoted an actual example and stated what the case was <e> <s> i can tell him with all reliability and very great carefulness about what i say that the anticipation is that the case in question set down a couple of weeks ago cannot come into the list until half way through <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord will accept that from me <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the difficulty which the noble lord brings before the committee and it is right that he should do so <e> <s> however since i do not disagree with the principle i ask only that the practical aspects of this matter are considered by the committee and especially by the noble and learned lord before this becomes part of an enactment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to say that the noble earl said he was speaking to one of my amendments <e> <s> it is kind of him but perhaps he did not intend to say so <e>", "<cs> i refer to amendment no <e> <s> ka <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has been very gracious <e> <s> in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this hour i should sensibly say that i shall consider carefully what the noble and learned lord has said and consider my position at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appear to have scored two half-goals out of four attempts and in those circumstances i feel i ought to say how grateful i am that at least those scores are achieved <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will kindly consider these matters i think the object of moving the amendments will have largely been achieved <e>", "<cs> it is a tragedy that at this hour when one is dealing with an attempted and very fundamental alteration in the law i should have to argue that this clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> clause seeks to alter the rule which has stood for a very long time that the limitation period involves the issue of a writ that is a matter of certainty of date <e> <s> the clause attempts to alter that by stating that it shall be the service of the writ <e> <s> this occasions extreme difficulty <e> <s> i shall try hard not to weary the committee with too many examples of why this is a bad provision <e>", "<cs> it is obvious that the noble and learned lord is prepared to consider the matter especially in regard to international implications and the examples that i gave of periods that are included by virtue of international conventions <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that still does not deal with the point about language namely that of severe dereliction of duty as against the words used in regard to the high court <e> <s> the noble and learned lord did not appear to me to deal with that specific matter <e> <s> if i misheard him due to the lateness of the hour or did not take in what he said when i should have done i apologise to him

very quickly on what he has just said and on my original submission <e> <s> we are dealing with a case where an officer of the court a solicitor has been penalised <e> <s> he goes to the court of appeal having obviously incurred the costs of a hearing in the court below <e> <s> the court of appeal sets aside the order that was made against him as being unjustified either in whole or in part

favourable consideration with a view to a clause which carries out the principle <e> <s> on that clear understanding i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish only to say this so that there is no misunderstanding <e> <s> that is exactly what i was quoting <e> <s> the minister inadvertently gave the impression that it would be impossible to sign the protocol if the amendment that i have moved were agreed to <e> <s> that is not the position as is shown by the fact that four other countries have done just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret some of the statements made by the noble earl only because i regarded as being unfortunate two matters to which i referred <e> <s> the noble earl will realise that i am not impugning any part of his integrity when talking to leading and informing the house <e> <s> i know him too well to believe that that is in issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl for that clarification <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating a most important statement on a most important white paper <e> <s> the aims of that white paper namely that those who commit violent crime should be adequately punished must be right and that part of the white paper that deals with the protection of the public must be right <e> <s> when i talk in terms of violent crime i obviously include violent sexual crimes as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister indicate whether the phrase sitting on ones laurels is english or american <e>",

sure that he will agree with me that even those figures as he said showed that the debates were few and far between the divisions were minimal and the effectiveness of this house in being able to deal

house <e> <s> our endeavour will be to co-operate and to see that international crime which is now of a grievous order whether in regard to drugs terrorism or similar matters will be <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene but i wonder whether it is possible sensibly to continue this debate on the amendment until we know whether or not it has been ratified <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly speak on the amendment which i support <e> <s> on second reading i asked in all innocence whether it was by way of a precedent that we were inserting into an act of parliament a report which might be considered on interpretation with its named authors to whom one wished length of days but who indeed might disappear from the human scene even though their report upon which one was unable to question them remained in the archives <e> <s> i was suitably taught that when legislation ratifies conventions it is common for such a provision to be inserted <e> <s> i learnt from that lesson and i shall not repeat the point on the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will bear with me <e> <s> as i said i was taught on second reading and i am more than happy to be taught in committee <e> <s> however he referred to clause as not excluding a judgment of the court of appeal or the house of lords but said that when the court of appeal or the house of lords adjudicates upon a matter that court should have and indeed must have the relevant decisions of the european court and the principles laid down by it as its guide <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble and learned lord read the report of last nights meeting convened in the east end of london by dr kalim siddiqui the director of britains moslem institute <e> <s> the report stated that <e>", "<cs> my lords we entirely appreciate that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran speaks with authority on behalf of the certain section of practitioners among whom he has always been a leading light <e> <s> perhaps i may speak for practitioners generally who ask not to be misled by consolidating statutes which seek to help understanding and not to create misunderstanding <e> <s> if a bill which seeks to consolidate certain enactments relating to capital allowances does nothing else it tells the practitioner that it relates only to the consolidation of certain enactments <e> <s> the practitioner is warned that there may very well be other enactments relating to capital allowances which have not been consolidated in this bill <e> <s> i cross out the word certain in view of the remarks of the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> but if we add the words <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a shame that the noble lord lord joseph is not present in this chamber today <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said yesterday this is a matter where the director of public prosecutions has considered all the evidence and to date has decided that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute for incitement to murder <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount could find some way of communicating to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor it should not be too difficult at <e>", "<cs> my lords as we too sought clarification perhaps i may from these benches thank the noble and learned lord for his gracious way of dealing with the matter <e> <s> he promised at committee stage that he would look into it he has done so and we now find the wording quite satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords we are moving with commendable speed <e> <s> i do not in any way intend to slow down the pace <e> <s> i want to thank the noble and learned lord for having accepted both in spirit and in fact the amendment that i moved at committee stage with support from various parts of the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will know that many members of the legal profession are still somewhat unhappy that the remedies available in the county court should be capable at all of being restricted by regulation <e> <s> this view was expressed in committee <e> <s> nevertheless if it is to be inserted in the bill as appears to be the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may give an example of when it is appropriate for leave to speak and leave to appeal should be heard <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson ought to take note since at report stage the debate closes except for the mover of the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless the house was pleased to hear the application for leave to appeal by the noble lord lord hooson even though it extended the length of the proceedings if i may say so to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say with deep respect to the master of the rolls that i find it somewhat surprising to hear the comparison or rather the similarity argued between our civil courts with civil litigants and those who appear in our criminal courts <e> <s> we are dealing with civil litigation where for some reason the liberty of the subject becomes involved <e> <s> there ought to be as we say in this amendment automatic right of appeal where that liberty becomes involved in civil proceedings <e> <s> i find myself in complete agreement with the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> i only ask for the deletion of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole of the legal profession has read with considerable interest a recent press statement that came from the noble and learned lords department in regard to a recommendation that the court of appeal in regard to defamation damages should have the right and power to review as against ordering a new trial unless the parties consented to the jurisdiction <e> <s> i can only tell the noble and learned lord that among those practitioners with whom i have mixed his statement has been welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords once more i am deeply grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed this need for clarification was made clear at committee <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has been gracious in seeing that that is the situation <e> <s> we are grateful to him for the clarification now in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that this is a completely correct amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am instructed that the law society regards this as a crust of comfort rather than a crumb <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hard to resist those gracious words <e> <s> i believe that the noble and learned lord knew how hard it would be to resist them when he uttered them <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help feeling that the advocate of whom the noble and learned lord lord hailsham spoke seemed to receive a great deal of advertisement out of acting for the queen at that time <e> <s> i do not suggest that that is the reason he accepted the brief <e>", "<cs> my lords they do have rights <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may tell your lordships that years ago those who are in the legal profession will know that what i am saying is true it was said that solicitors managing clerks were the main foundation of the office <e> <s> that was literally true <e> <s> i can well understand why the loyal experienced managing clerk was chosen to brief the noble lord lord renton and to attend conferences with him <e> <s> the noble lord did not see a partner <e> <s> the managing clerk most probably did much better than the partner would have done <e> <s> the managing clerk was disappearing from the profession until the institute of legal executives gave him great dignity and required a great deal of qualification from those who were admitted to the institute as members <e>", "<cs> my lords i say with deep respect that i am not quite sure whether it is the right note to sound if we use the words what the bar council would like or want and what the law society would like or want <e> <s> i have the deepest respect for my own professional body <e> <s> i hope that i shall always be a loyal member of it <e> <s> but this is a committee which will advise <e> <s> obviously if the law societys advice or the bar councils advice were wanted it is always available to the noble and learned lord without the need to set up a statutory body <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor address the same question to the master of the rolls that he addressed to the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> if it was in order for the question to be addressed to the noble and learned lord lord ackner who replied is it not similarly open to the master of the rolls <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very short in what i have to say <e> <s> i should like first to express gratitude to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for having incorporated into the bill in very clear terms a principle which we from these benches supported <e> <s> i believe it was also supported by members on other benches <e> <s> we asked that the advisory committee should have very much in mind the cause of equal opportunity between men and women ethnic minorities and so on <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the lord chancellor will be advised by the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to extend the usual courtesies and to thank the members of the committee drawn from both houses for their efforts in going through what was in this case a very complicated consolidation bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a short plea to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> from his point of view it is one which will fall onto ears that are ready to listen <e> <s> would it not be advisable to ensure so far as is possible that our laws especially those governing professions of a similar nature are the same both north and south of the border <e> <s> is not this a case in which consistency with the scottish bill will be brought into our own bill <e> <s> is that not a good reason for accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can put my point in a couple of sentences <e> <s> regardless of everything else i can tell the house with a humble sense of authority that if solicitors clerks were not allowed to appear in the county court practitioners would not be able to continue to accept the burden of work that they have at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down and with the leave of the house perhaps i may emphasise the word that he used <e> <s> he said that it was normally permitted <e> <s> therefore there could be some abnormal cases of which he would disapprove because he feels as i understand it that the discretion that is normally given is the right discretion <e> <s> could he therefore remove the abnormal case which would be a nuisance to everybody by including these words <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right that each of us should examine this matter with the greatest of <e>", "<cs> quite right and women i am sorry i should have said that <e> <s> however it is little mrs smith who is charged with shoplifting who needs all the care in the world from a prosecutor who may be dealing with the evidence in a way which may be too aggressive and too unfair <e> <s> i should have thought on balance that this amendment contains grave imperfections <e> <s> however as i said before i am more than willing to listen to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend in any way to indulge in your lordships house in either criticising or praising individual judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not mind giving way for one moment so that we can present the full position <e> <s> i know that the noble lord always wishes to present the full position <e> <s> does the noble lord consider that if at the end of presenting a case to go for trial there was a submission that there was no case to answer the directors representative in the magistrates court would not be fit to conduct that case becasue he could not be independent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i can be of any assistance in this matter <e> <s> as one would expect the master of the rolls is absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down he gave a courteous reply to the noble and learned lord lord ackner saying that he would be informed informally of the progress in regard to schedule <e> <s> may i take it that the same courtesy applies to all of us who have been interested in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down our procedure is somewhat difficult on report as he will appreciate <e> <s> when perfectly pertinent questions are asked by the mover of the amendment the noble and learned lord is courteous enough to answer and then one is deemed to be or has to be silent <e> <s> therefore i only have the opportunity of asking the noble and learned lord a question before he sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that if any one of the designated judges disliked the provision which until then had been deemed to be passed then the protection against the competition authority would be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is on the assumption that it merely deals with merits <e> <s> we support this amendment on the basis that an existing rule relating to rights of audience should only be challenged if i may put it that way and certainly only be done away with if there is a unanimous view of the lord chancellor and each of the designated judges <e> <s> that is what this amendment does <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has moved the amendment with great ability <e> <s> i emphasise that because it is so refreshing to have an amendment moved by someone who is not a member of the legal profession <e> <s> some of us could learn from her not only by the able way in which she moved it but by the economy of words which she used <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is most courteous in allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i wish him to follow the kind of danger we envisage and if he has not done so it is my fault and not his <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the first lessons which an advocate learns and nobody knows this better than the noble and learned lord is that if the judge is with you for heavens sake be quiet and sit down <e> <s> i merely make the excuse of saying anything else in view of the fact that i wanted to make something abundantly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches support this amendment for the reasons given so eloquently by the noble lord lord boardman <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the noble and learned lord he has been good enough to say in reply to the amendment that he will look into whether clause would give him the power to make a regulation dealing with fair pricing fair costing and cross-subsidy <e> <s> secondly he would wish in any regulations he made to carry out the policy in the white paper an extract from which i read <e> <s> thirdly he will obviously have in mind when we come to the third stage putting down an amendment if he finds that it is necessary after examining the powers under clause which will deal with these matters <e> <s> on the basis that i have understood the noble and learned lord correctly i am pleased to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i should like him to confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is important <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord will say that he in no way seeks to differ now from the policy set out in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it was of course the aims of the passage that i had in mind <e> <s> i understand that the machinery can obviously be dealt with after consideration as regards the best machinery to be employed <e> <s> i am deeply grateful to the noble and learned lord for his remarks <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the last thing which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor wants is a defence from this dispatch box provided by me <e> <s> he does not need it and for all i know it may embarrass him <e> <s> however i wish to answer the points that have been raised <e> <s> the time of night has not diminished the eloquence of the noble and learned lord lord simon nor the power to speak in his usual forthright way <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall obviously have to consult with those advising me on this matter <e> <s> in the meantime i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a sentence or two <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord renton put his finger on a good description of this fee when he said it was highly controversial <e> <s> none of us quite knows how it is going to work <e> <s> i should have thought that when one has something which is highly controversial when one needs to see how it works out and how it ought to be regulated indeed how it may have to be stopped the requirement is <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder how the noble and learned lord thinks that the amendment could in practice be carried out <e> <s> i would understand it completely if the profession were subject to a rate card which said precisely how much a client would be charged <e> <s> i could understand it if there were no such thing as an agreement between solicitor and client as to the fees that should be charged <e> <s> i could understand it if it were a rule which it certainly is not that all clients should be charged on precisely the same basis the wealthy the same as those who are fairly comfortably placed and the fairly comfortably placed in the same way as the poor client <e> <s> all that i could understand if one were thinking in terms of an order which laid down a percentage as a maximum but bearing in mind the way in which the profession works i do not see with respect how the provision has any practicability at all <e> <s> if i have erred i know that the noble and learned lord will deal with me gently <e> <s> however at the moment i do not see how this can be put in a statute because as i see it the provision has no practical outcome at all <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and before the noble and learned lord sits down i understand that <e> <s> it may well be that i ought to have raised this matter at committee stage <e> <s> i am anxious that before the bill leaves the house everybody is apprised of the fact that we have allowed the bill to go from this place in an orderly and practical way <e> <s> if every bill of costs of a solicitor is taxed it will impose a terrific burden upon the taxing office of the court quite apart from imposing hardship upon practitioners who may have to wait a long time before they know what fee is payable by the client <e> <s> what beats me at the moment is this <e> <s> a fee agreement may presumably say because i have entered into an arrangement with you the client to act for you on this matter and it is upon the conditional fee basis if you are successful i am to be paid a sum which is equivalent to the amount of costs that i would normally have received plus <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we from these benches supported to the full the legislation <e> <s> we shall be more than happy to support any further legislation which the government may see fit to bring forward in order to stop this evil trade <e> <s> is he further aware that it is not just the ordinary financial institutions that appear to be indulging obviously quite innocently in the laundering <e> <s> it is mainly the building societies now <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of the means that are being employed to see that those who manage building societies are apprised not only of the legislation but of the laundering that is taking place through their medium <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to compete in any way with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in his denigratory adjectives in regard to government departments and institutions <e> <s> however does the minister agree that on his own arithmetic if there are cases a year and a backlog of cases cases which are two years old have not yet been started <e> <s> is that not dreadful <e> <s> will he consider the governments decision last year to reduce the threshold from to before anyone may make a claim <e> <s> does he agree that for many people worth of loss is the equivalent to others of well over worth of

court judgment <e> <s> is the legal advice being sought on the basis of how the minister can make it retrospective because he wants to or is it being taken on whether he has to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has possibly misunderstood my question <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the -page judgment which was very clear in what it said <e> <s> is he saying that the minister is seeking a legal opinion because he wants to make it retrospective in sheer justice or is he seeking the legal opinion on the basis of whether he has to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may cast another light on this amendment of the noble and learned lord and indeed by anticipation the amendment to be moved by the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits

unreasonable to try to test the opinion of the house with the numbers that we have available and at this time <e> <s> it is only for that reason that i beg leave to withdraw the amendnment <e>", "<cs>

comment the amendments are most welcome and we are grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the hopes engendered in my noble friends by recent opinion polls i think i ought not to say anything from this front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will as usual appreciate the manner in which the noble earl has moved this order <e> <s> i should at once like to echo from these benches what he said in expressing appreciation to the noble viscount lord colville for his report which we read with great care <e> <s> we realise the effort the fairness and the assiduous work that he puts into these reports which we very much value <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl with his usual courtesy will give way <e> <s> i rise only so that the house may be clear on what is being said <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house at this hour if i am permitted to speak to amendment no <e> <s> after the noble lord lord renton has just introduced his amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the bar may take a degree of comfort from what the noble lord lord renton has just said and from the ambit of clause <e> <s> however the fear that my side of the profession has is in regard to those who conduct conveyancing practices and conveyancing practices and probate only and trust work only and merging in partnership with those whom it would not be seemly as some of us think to be in partnership both in protection of the public and in regard to the way in which a disciplinary body can exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords my happiness with the present designated judge is complete whatever the hour of the day at which i say that <e> <s> i was about to go on to refer to the fact that obviously any alteration in the rules would need to have the approval of the master of the rolls <e> <s> that is the one comfort that i am left with <e> <s> it is a substantial comfort but it would have been very good if we could have written into the bill a safeguard against as i put it the inroads that competition law may make into the jurisdiction whether it be of the law society itself or indeed of the master of the rolls in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am proud to share the dignified title which i hold and to which the noble lord was kind enough to refer with anybody who is empowered to take oaths <e> <s> however perhaps i may point out one possible difficulty even though i may be wrong about it <e> <s> internationally a notary is required to attest documents <e> <s> the word notary is known abroad as a requirement <e> <s> if this means as it seems to do that in future notaries describe themselves as commissioners for oaths i am afraid that quite a lot of international difficulty might arise with the document being sent back with the requirement that it must be signed before a notary not before a commissioner for oaths <e> <s> provided the notary was intelligent enough when taking oaths within the jurisdiction of the united kingdom to sign commissioner for oaths and when he attested documents which had to go abroad as notary all would be well <e> <s> i thought i ought to raise the point in case it had any relevance <e>", "<cs> my lords if anyone at this stage were to make a speech incorporating all that he felt had been done by the house to improve the bill and the defects which he felt were still left he would be the most unpopular member of your lordships house <e> <s> i therefore do not intend to do any such thing <e>", "<cs> my lord is it not a fact that the age group which we are considering constitutes a major and tragic percentage of those responsible for the crime figures that have been given to the house on a previous occasion <e> <s> does the minister ally homelessness to criminality among young people <e> <s> is the interdepartmental committee of which he spoke aware of the relevance of homelessness to the crime figures <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps there is some misunderstanding <e> <s> did the minister realise that i was talking about the percentage of the total crime <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the constitutional position as so correctly given to us by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham may be is there anything to stop a treasury minister from having a discussion with the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister now have such a discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords has it escaped the attention of the noble viscount that since there has been a greater need for charity among people who before that date did not need it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can assist several members of the house who have raised this point <e> <s> he has just quoted paragraph of the code <e> <s> is it really suggested that inspectors can make a finding of fact about lying upon oath and deliberately do so without having had prima facie evidence before them <e> <s> if so that is a scandal <e> <s> if not what does paragraph mean other than that there should be a prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise the minister that this is my last intervention but this matter is most serious <e> <s> will the minister please forget the a <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister once again but these are such vital matters for the citizen generally quite apart from the people concerned in the report <e> <s> i am sure that the minister has been advised that the only way in which one can apply to the court for an injunction restraining publication would be either because a criminal charge is being brought and therefore there would be prejudice or in the alternative the report constituted a libel on which action could be taken <e> <s> i repeat the inspectors have qualified privilege and it is quite impossible to take such action <e> <s> i hope that as a result of this discussion the minister will consult with his colleagues about the fairness of this whole procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords on what grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble earl the minister for his courtesy in repeating this solemn and sad statement <e> <s> one could be forgiven for being near to tears when looking at the television screen and seeing what happened in our country and in the centre of our capital city <e> <s> football hooliganism is the enemy of football political hooligans are the enemies of our democracies and our freedoms <e> <s> they are the enemy too of the political decencies that we cherish in this country <e> <s> therefore all of us as the statement says every member of this house wherever he sits will join in the condemnation of what took place and echo the words that our law has to be seen to be fully enforced against those who are guilty of conduct of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a day of sad statements <e> <s> with regard to the one to which we have just listened we thank the noble earl for his courtesy in repeating it there are some questions which ought to be asked <e> <s> before i ask any questions let me at once pay tribute from these benches to the courage of the prison officers involved and say that we hope that some of the figures in regard to the injuries which they sustained are not increased <e> <s> we hope that this dreadful occurrence will very soon draw to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords the very first words that one wishes to utter from these benches is to echo <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will allow me to intervene <e> <s> does he really believe that we ought to leave the matter to a guess <e> <s> that was the word that the minister used <e> <s> ought it not to be made thoroughly clear what is within the terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall have the indulgence of the house in returning to a topic which i regard as extremely important <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will also forgive me <e> <s> it was not a question of semantics <e> <s> i asked something which in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like my immediate words to be words of gratitude to the noble earl the minister for the consideration that he gave to the arguments that were put forward in this house <e> <s> i am sure that they were also considered in the other place when this amendment was made to the bill <e> <s> it is an important amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches and from other parts of the house complaints are made when a whole host of government amendments are suddenly inserted into bills <e> <s> on this occasion there will be no complaint from these benches <e> <s> we welcome wholeheartedly the insertion of these clauses <e> <s> we are extremely glad that the gap to which the noble earl clearly referred has now been closed <e> <s> if we have made it more difficult even almost impossible for the wretched drug traders to get hold <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon was trying to guess before your lordships what argument it was that led the noble and learned lord to bring forward this amendment <e> <s> i add a further guess and i think i am much nearer the mark <e> <s> it was the weight of the opinion of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale which he put forward with such clarity <e> <s> that will always weigh not only with this house but also with <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps your lordships will permit an apology then a tribute then an explanation <e> <s> the apology is that unfortunately i shall have to leave shortly after the welcome stage has been reached of my sitting down as a result of an urgent professional engagement <e> <s> the tribute is to the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton and the noble lord lord middleton not only for their chairmanship of the two committees i include in that tribute obviously the members of the committees but also for the clarity with which both have addressed the house <e> <s> the explanation is that i intend to deal only with the control of human beings <e> <s> my noble friend lord gallacher will deal with other animate and inanimate objects which may be subject to control <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will take it as understood that we on these benches decry rioting and behaviour of that kind at any prison <e> <s> we certainly join in with the sympathy that has been expressed for prison officers who have to undergo that kind of treatment yet again <e> <s> does the minister agree that since the strangeways incident rioting has taken place in the following prisons i regret having to read out the list but the house ought to be aware of it brixton bristol cardiff castington dartmoor hull kirkham lindholme long lartin manchester pentonville swansea stoke heath and verne <e> <s> without claiming that my observations were anything other than common sense perhaps i may remind the minister of the words that i ventured to use on th april on the matter of strangeways prison <e> <s> as i said from these benches on the occasion of the last statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord stoddart will forgive me if i dissociate myself from the remarks that he made with great sincerity but not with great wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i read to the house details of the copycat incidents which have taken place <e> <s> are the government saying that before we have a policy for dealing with the critical situation we must wait for lord justice woolfs report <e> <s> do not the government have every annual report of all chief inspectors of prisons detailing the terrible <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the critical situation i asked the minister when the report is expected to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot allow the unanimity of this house to continue for one minute longer before making the usual comments in regard to consolidation bills <e> <s> either the noble and learned lord on the woolsack rises and thanks the committee consisting of members of both houses they go through such bills with great care under the chairmanship of a distinguished law lord and i immediately rise from these benches and say how right he is or i do so and the noble and learned lord rises and says how right i am <e> <s> the agreement between us ought to be encouraged and therefore i express gratitude to members of the committee for the wearisome but useful task they perform for the house <e>", "<cs> my lords a word or two ought to be said about the bill before it is passed by your <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord beloff would deliver his own speech instead of making me manufacture mine <e>", "<cs> give us the tools and we will finish the job <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us who regard it as a privilege to be a member of this very civilised house and i am proud to call myself one will be indebted to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for giving us the opportunity even in a short debate to discuss our future <e> <s> i must say that if anyone is to introduce it in this chamber i do not think that any of us would prefer a name other than that of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is not just a question of his political career which was eminent or of his judicial career which was even more eminent <e> <s> he has been a great fighter in this house for the rights of the members of the house of lords <e> <s> the noble lord the leader of the house had to put up with some very fine and direct oratory quite recently in the courts and legal services bill as to the infringement of the rights of this house by those who dominate the front bench opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would be kind enough to give way <e> <s> of course it is very easy to criticise proposals for reform <e> <s> before the noble lord finishes his speech are we to hear whether he on behalf of the government has any reform proposals at all to which we could listen or is he going to say that he wants the situation that we are in to continue for ever <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> is it in order in a debate on this amendment to deal with how this chamber should approach the second reading of the war crimes bill when we are not dealing with that second reading <e>", "<cs> it has been emphasised that this is a question of conscience and personal belief

time the place or the appropriate debate in which to come to any such decision <e> <s> unlike others i do not speak as a theologian <e> <s> in this instance i do not speak as a lawyer <e> <s> i shall try to introduce what i believe every one of us wishes to protect namely the clarity of thought and disciplined business methods of this house <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord as i did previously but he will be very keen to see that nobody is misled in the committee and that any accusation made against an honourable member of his own front bench is made seriously and properly <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate as i understood him said that it would be perfectly appropriate as he saw it for an amendment to be moved to the war crimes bill saying that this evidentiary procedure should not be invoked or be able to be used in the event of war crimes <e> <s> that was made perfectly clear to the committee certainly to me <e>", "<cs> my lords in case the house does not share the mystery of this question i point out that it relates to the decade which we are now starting at the instance of the united nations concerning natural disasters <e> <s> does the minister agree that the success of this decade will really depend on the amount of co-ordination in the united kingdom that we manage to arrange <e> <s> therefore is he aware of the part to be played by local authorities and voluntary organisations <e> <s> i ask the minister to refer to paragraph instead of paragraph of the paper to which the noble lord lord renton referred <e> <s> can the noble earl say what has been done by the overseas development administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will forgive me as i rise again for one moment <e> <s> i do not believe that he understood my question and i am sure that that is my fault <e> <s> i was dealing with the question of co-ordination in the united kingdom and not in relation to matters that may arise abroad <e> <s> if the minister is unable to reply immediately i shall understand <e> <s> bearing in mind the recommendation made in the paper to which the noble lord lord renton has referred can the minister say what is being done by his department and the overseas development administration in being the focal point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that decisions in regard to this disaster which took place at strangeways prison were taken at a national level <e> <s> if such decisions are taken at that level and not at local level is not the resulting expenditure a national matter <e> <s> does the noble earl also recall that on april th his right honourable friend said in another place that he had in fact agreed to set up a meeting with the people of manchester in order to hear their representations <e> <s> can he tell the house whether that meeting has been fixed and if so for what date <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale said is the minister aware that in many cases hostel managers are refusing admission to bail hostels not merely to those with drug and alcohol problems but to those with mental problems <e> <s> in the consideration which he says is being given to the matter is thought being given to setting aside special places in bail hostels for people with those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister correct in drawing a comparison between the taking of a driving test by a british citizen and this very important matter of visas for people from eastern europe <e> <s> is not this a great opportunity to allow our window which is a very different one to be seen by emergent democracies in eastern europe <e> <s> is it not a valuable way of countering years of propaganda against the west <e> <s> could not a special charge below be made for this privilege in history <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will forgive me if i return to the question which i asked of him only because i think that he misunderstood me <e> <s> will he take it from me that i certainly did not suggest the abandonment of the requirement for a visa in the case of any country <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords free from all constraint i immediately plead with the house for the right of freedom of reply for professor dworkin <e> <s> that is a freedom which unfortunately he does not enjoy in spite of the remarks made by the noble lord lord beloff <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that comment but it does not answer the point <e> <s> one must assume that if the european convention had been incorporated into our law our courts would have found in exactly the same way as the european court unless one is offensive to their judges that there had been more breaches than were reported to the european court <e>

very distinguished debate to address the house by way of a winding up speech made personally from these benches as indeed the speech made by my noble friend lord irvine of lairg was a personal speech

and rebuilding programmes are the essential civilised elements that unfortunately are lacking in strangeways prison at the moment and have been over past years <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the chief difficulty regarding speed on motorways lies with contraflows with the lethal m and with repair works <e> <s> i recognise what he says and appreciate the fact that the police force must decide for itself on the best use of manpower <e> <s> however cannot cameras be used on the motorways with much more effect in order to ascertain speed <e> <s> would it not also be useful for those cameras to be advertised so that they are a deterrent as well as a source for conviction <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister wish to have that remark go on record in <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the chaos which the minister informs the house exists and in view of his pessimism as to agreement being reached on new legislation what does he advise the country and especially local authorities to do regarding the present law <e> <s> will he comment on the great number of areas which are now surprisingly claiming to be holiday resorts <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the leader of the house for repeating that sombre statement <e> <s> perhaps i may at once on behalf of every single person sitting on the benches behind me register our sympathy with noble lords opposite <e> <s> on an occasion such as this there are only physical divisions in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the seriousness of the position perhaps your lordships will

house why during recent months young unsentenced offenders have been transferred from brockhill youth remand centre to birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of these uncivilised conditions is it not surprising that the report also says that in the year million of the budget was underspent for this prison <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether that money could have been transferred <e>", "<cs> my lords as is its custom the house expresses appreciation to the noble earl for the clear manner in which he presented the bill <e> <s> it is a bill that awakens memories of previous discussions in regard to hong kong and our duties generally when with dignity and honourable conduct we disbanded what was an empire and turned it into a commonwealth <e> <s> the duty upon the house today and in future stages of the bill certainly the second reading will not be opposed from these benches is as the noble earl pointed out to ensure that in so far as we are able we preserve the liberties of the citizens of hong kong give them security and persuade the chinese government to see that obligations as we understood them are fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding will he make clear without necessarily mentioning a name that the gentleman in another place to whom he referred is not a member of

unusual moderation of my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon on these matters <e> <s> does the noble and learned <e> <s> lord agree that the situation should not come as a surprise to parliament <e>

noble and learned lord agree i take up the point of the noble lord lord rippon that an injunction is a discretionary remedy which would only be exercised if the court thought it proper in certain circumstances <e> <s> will he join with me in hoping that in the course of the deliberations one finds out who could apply for such an injunction <e> <s> for example could her majestys opposition or a member of parliament apply to restrain parliament from passing a certain act <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble and learned lord for returning to the matter <e> <s> is he saying that the

moneys obtained from drug traffickers as a result of international agreements should go to combat drug trafficking <e> <s> is it the policy of her majestys government to argue for that course rather

asking why it has been put in <e> <s> we look at the wording and find that it does not follow the nationality act in providing specifically that judicial review is available <e> <s> therefore the

is because it would introduce something which presumably would make life too clear for lawyers and everyone else <e> <s> i find that an unacceptable argument <e> <s> in those circumstances i am afraid that i must ask the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i have been keeping a discreet silence on the amendment but i might be misleading the committee if i did not rise from this front bench as a result of the views expressed perfectly sincerely by the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> the opposition have made their position abundantly clear namely that the dislike the points system and regard it as unfair <e> <s> if we supported this amendment it would mean that we were supporting anew the increase in the figure under the points system <e> <s> for that reason alone if this were put to a division i should have to advise my noble friends to vote against the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is kind to give way <e> <s> i have never said we should not have any <e> <s> i have never said that we should not have any more <e> <s> i shall not repeat my second reading speech but i made it perfectly clear that we could not support an amendment which meant that additional people from hong kong were selected under a points scheme <e> <s> perhaps i may quote the noble lord lord monson who apparently believes that the public of this country have expressed a view that they would not mind a few more provided that they came from the middle class <e> <s> i wondered whether the working class of this country were included in that assessment of public opinion <e>", "<cs> the minister is so generous that he has dealt not only with amendments that i moved but with amendment no <e> <s> which i have not yet moved <e> <s> in order to expedite the proceedings of the committee i say at once that it seems a great shame that the government are recommending that parliament be excluded from vital matters that affect the citizens of a colony that they have looked after for so many years <e> <s> it is a shame that all this is being done locally <e>", "<cs> with his admirable and usual ingenuity the minister paraphrased what he said under amendment no <e> <s> with eloquence and clarity when he dealt with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have failed to convince him that parliament should play some part in this matter and that there should be ministerial responsibility instead of placing it all in hong kong <e> <s> i seem to have failed in that effort <e> <s> at this time it is inappropriate to do anything other than ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at least i have advanced in the sense that the point i made is understandable <e> <s> that indeed is progress <e> <s> it does not really mean that i think that the government accept the amendment <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> in the course of moving amendment no <e> <s> i pointed out what appeared to be a contrast to say the least if not an inconsistency between clause and clause <e> <s> clause says that the governor recommends and the secretary of state has to accept the mandatory word is now in <e> <s> the only exceptions to that are made by clause <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> i was not in the chamber when the noble lord lord monkswell spoke at second reading <e> <s> however i hope that i know him well enough to know that he did not wish to give offence to anyone <e> <s> if he meant literally what he said i do not think that he did i should like to dissociate the front bench of this party from any such suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be appropriate to say a few words in regard to this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to all those who have spoken in this debate on what i still consider to be a very important amendment <e> <s> the noble earl said that i stood in isolation on this occasion <e> <s> of course at the committee stage i did not stand in isolation <e> <s> it was the minister who stood with great courage although embattled against the noble lords lord harmar-nicholls and lord renton <e> <s> at the time he was asked to think again because it was an important point <e> <s> i admire the noble earl for standing with such bravery in isolation on that occasion <e> <s> i hope that he has a similar admiration for me now <e>", "<cs> my lords from a sedentary position the noble lord makes as wise a remark as he does from an upright position <e> <s> in answer i say only that parliament saw fit to ensure that in appropriate cases even that delegation of formal powers as well they may be must in some cases be subject to the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> but away with technical and academic arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord lloyd says hear hear i should remind him of his eloquent speech to the house <e> <s> it was to disagree with my amendment and then to sit down <e> <s> i thought that the house was listening anxiously to know the reasoning behind his decision <e> <s> however he did not give it <e>", "<cs> my lords and without explanation <e> <s> obviously we want to conclude the matter <e> <s> during the course of my remarks i said that when the noble lords lord kadoorie and lord maclehose speak on behalf of the people of hong kong one listens with deep respect <e> <s> i know that they regard the word may as putting doubt into the minds of people in hong kong about whether this parliament is sincere in trying to help them whether or not one agrees with the method of the help <e> <s> my noble friends and i would be the last people in the world to want to interfere with the restoration of morale which we know has sunk very low <e> <s> it is for that reason and for that reason only that i shall not press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl closes the debate except for the mover of the amendment i shall be deprived of saying a few words <e> <s> i did try to rise but obviously i did not do so quickly enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give my views briefly in answer to my noble friend lord howie and in any event because i believe that the house is entitled to know the view of the official opposition on the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate what the minister has said about the scheme he will know does he not <e> <s> that there have been many complaints with regard to the delays which occur in settling compensation and in the adjudication process <e> <s> will he inform the house how this country compares with the rest of western europe in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply was somewhat vague <e> <s> however can the minister indicate the average delays that occur in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister take into account the feeling expressed throughout the fire service and throughout the land at all levels that these cuts as really they are will affect safety standards and training and careers in the fire service <e> <s> can he give an assurance that where a local authority lacks the funds that he speaks of that will in no way affect the careers of the fire service members within that authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked a question which i now repeat <e> <s> where the local authority has different priorities of need and determines that those priorities do not take into account the fire service and the fire service college will the minister give an assurance that that will not affect the careers and training of the fire service members within those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down in the interests of the house would he kindly consider this proposal <e> <s> in the course of a most interesting and as usual eloquent speech he announced to the house that radical amendments would be made by him at third reading <e> <s> he left out one of which i happened a minute ago to have a note <e> <s> it is a very important one instead of make provision for the words cater for <e> <s> that is a fundamental alteration <e>", "<cs> my lords if he did then i missed it and i apologise to the noble earl i did not hear it <e> <s> is it not a courtesy to the house which has not had time to consider what he has announced as amendments that he might bring forward at third reading to withdraw his present amendment and come to the house at third reading with an amendment in tidy form which could be properly considered <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that his reply will be disappointing to many people who are very worried about the record crime rate figures <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the house of the per cent <e> <s> increase in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year <e> <s> were the government not able to talk about greater police patrolling or about rehabilitation in the answer to the question <e> <s> is the noble earl content with the home secretarys speech at the tory party conference this side of the house would not have joined in the ovation when issues of capital punishment more severe sentences and cessation of parole in certain cases seemed to be the key-note of a very disappointing speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in every debate in your lordships house about the press and its standards the standard of journalism in certain journals has come under bitter criticism <e> <s> is he also aware that if this self-regulatory body is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be good enough to explain to the house how the effectiveness of a power of a commission can be looked at by the government when the power is not given to that commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with considerable sorrow and only a modicum of anger in regard to this bill and the way in which this house is asked to consider or so amendments from another place <e> <s> i find it very easy to be angry with the government and extremely difficult to be angry with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> indeed from my point of view as well i hope as from that of your lordships he is the object of sympathy <e> <s> it is an impossible situation in which this house has been placed <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are most welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will appreciate that in the midst of subsection b of amendment no <e> <s> there appears the word unreasonable <e> <s> it is necessary to say a few words about that and i wish to ask the noble and learned lord to confirm my view <e> <s> it is important to realise that this is a provision in regard to wasted costs which can be made against a professional man a solicitor <e> <s> the word unreasonable needs a little attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the spirit of this amendment will commend itself to the whole house <e> <s> however there is a very dangerous precedent being set and i feel it my duty to call the attention of the house to it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls as always has answered an argument with great ability <e> <s> but it was not the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely sure that these amendments will meet with the sympathy understanding and indeed the approval of the whole house <e> <s> there will now be as we have had in the high court specially trained judges to deal with family <e>", "<cs> my lords the only comment i wish to make is in regard to amendment no <e> <s> which the noble and learned lord has so lucidly explained <e> <s> we on these benches are not very happy with that provision which permits creditors to cease supplying utilities that is gas electricity or water to debtors for whom administration orders have been made where they fail to pay charges incurred after the order <e> <s> that means that that can be done without leave of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one small point to raise <e> <s> it is only for clarification on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will in his usual lucid way make easier the task of those bodies which will draw up rules applicable to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> a person is not to withhold his services according to paragraph ii <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord would not expect me to defend a man who had destroyed my waiting-room <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will welcome these provisions which are so sensible and useful especially in view of the advent of <e> <s> however there is some worry that having made these rules there will not be sufficient reciprocity with other countries <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord has a considerable amount of influence in those countries and with their professional bodies <e> <s> may we rely on him to see that as much reciprocity is granted to our own lawyers <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be wrong and if so i may be rapped over the knuckles but i read these amendments as relating to civil proceedings giving what we used to call a managing clerk or an executive as he is now called in a solicitors office whether employed full or part time exactly the same facilities in the county court in chambers as he has always had in the high court <e> <s> i should have thought that it is almost an a <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a query on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendments provide that where deemed approval is withdrawn the provision in question shall cease to have effect <e> <s> as i understand it the government had originally explained that the purpose of withdrawing deemed approval was to enable the competition authority to examine whether or not a provision was anti-competitive <e> <s> but surely there is no reason why a provision that is subject to challenge in that way should be invalidated in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack for his very gracious reference to the amendment which i had the privilege of moving <e> <s> as a result of the amendment which comes from the other place it now appears as a very valuable principle in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that the amendments provided that conditions could be put down relating to repayment and that that was the reason for them <e> <s> if i am wrong i bow to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am sure that the law society is equally grateful to him for these very useful amendments which give the board the powers of intervention which he mentioned <e> <s> i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i should like to explain to your lordships the basis of my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will forgive me i was slightly put off by the fact that he mentioned amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had expected that he would be moving amendments nos <e> <s> and and that afterwards on amendment no <e> <s> i would move my amendment to the amendment but he said that he was putting amendment no <e> <s> as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i should like briefly to explain to your lordships the reason for my amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> it has been said that we are living in an age of leakages <e> <s> whoever be the government of the day they find it most embarrassing that from all quarters documents are leaked and confidential information leaked <e> <s> i suppose that it is the experience of most of us in the legal profession that if anybody interesting is charged or arrested there appears to be a leakage from the relevant police station to fleet street within a matter of seconds <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately bow to the noble and learned lord especially in view of his kindness in saying that he was prepared to review the matter in the light of experience <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mystified <e> <s> it must be my fault but at least i have the excuse as i understand it that the law society is similarly mystified by one part of the provision <e> <s> i completely understand that the statute should be able to say that a private practitioner must work under supervision or that the employee must work under supervision <e> <s> but for some unknown reason a body corporate is able to employ anybody to prepare papers for probate without such supervision <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble and learned lord would forgive me <e> <s> before he sits down could he say whether i am completely wrong in looking at amendment no <e> <s> a and saying with the wording of the section that subsection does not apply to <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not take up the time of the house or the noble and learned lord any longer <e> <s> it still seems to me i say this with deep respect that if one is an individual practitioner one must jolly well see that there is supervision by a solicitor barrister or a notary <e> <s> if one is a corporate entity be it a bank or whatever that supervision is not necessary <e> <s> i must not detain the house any longer but that is a worrying thought if what i am saying is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should merely like to add that the leadership given by the noble and learned lord in this matter is very much appreciated by the professions <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purpose of the record would the noble and learned lord care to indicate why it is that the lord chancellor is not in the list <e>", "<cs> my lords the legal profession and the public at large owe a deep debt of gratitude to the noble and learned lord for all the care that he has taken in regard to these tying in provisions <e> <s> i happen to know the number of consultations that he has had and the thought that he has given to the matter <e> <s> he deserves the appreciation of everyone who is concerned with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords justice has been served <e> <s> on question motion agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour of the night i thought that the noble and learned lord was remarkably quick in his response <e> <s> perhaps i may make a suggestion for the future because i have learnt from what the noble lord lord renton has said <e> <s> it is misleading to have on the front of the commons amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i echo those remarks <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has as always shown great courtesy great patience and great skill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the leader of the opposition asked a specific question about articles and <e> <s> the minister did not answer the question in regard to those articles <e> <s> if he is unaware of what the articles contain the house will have its usual sympathy if he frankly admits to that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for making that interesting statement <e> <s> the principles behind the statement namely that fathers together with mothers who can afford it should be responsible for the maintenance of their children and that the children come first are obviously acceptable to the whole house and certainly to the benches that i represent <e> <s> however there are some questions that one must ask in order to ensure that the measures are not intended merely to save money for the government but effectively to relieve hardship in regard to the children wives and mothers in the cases that will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord forgive my persistence <e> <s> the point that i wish to raise is particularly relevant to the interesting question which my noble friend asked <e> <s> if there were to be established a family court where questions of access could be dealt with at the same time as issues concerning maintenance would that not be so much better than setting up a separate agency <e> <s> the two matters would dovetail <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord with all his knowledge and experience not aware of this <e> <s> we may have a situation where maintenance is awarded against a father in a situation such as that to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> the child may be illegitimate <e> <s> the circumstances would be such that maintenance would be awarded by a different tribunal at a different place from that where access may be dealt with if for example it was a divorce matter <e> <s> are we not separating two matters that should be judged together <e>", "<cs> my lords when i had the pleasure a year or so ago of speaking following the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack i said to him that he had immediately earned the respect of the whole house <e> <s> a year later i add i know i speak also for your lordships that he has earned the very deep regard of the house <e> <s> i ask only one favour of him and again i do it on behalf of the whole house that is please do not resign <e> <s> it is over the days of the debate on the address that we in this house consider the state of the nation <e> <s> we cover wide subjects affecting every part of our national life <e> <s> in a speech concerning home and social affairs it is difficult to concentrate on more than one or two subjects <e> <s> therefore i hope your lordships will forgive me if i deal only with law and order and our prison system and my noble friend lord carter apart from other matters of social interest will deal with education and the measures regarding child maintenance to which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor referred <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that as the noble baroness lady seear and my noble friends on these benches have said this is a matter of great concern to a great many people <e> <s> does he not understand that it is not good enough to answer that only the european court can define precisely what it meant and say whether its judgment is retrospective <e> <s> the government should take the initiative and bring the matter before the european court either by asking for a declaration or seeking some test case <e> <s> is he prepared to look into that and provide clarification of an issue which is at present confused <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will forgive me for returning to the dispatch box <e> <s> this is an important matter <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there is a procedure by which one can obtain a declaration from the european court on an issue which one puts before the european court <e> <s> is it possible to create a test case immediately if that is the route by which he wants to go <e>"]
