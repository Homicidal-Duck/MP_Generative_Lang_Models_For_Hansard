["<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may be permitted to intervene because i myself tried in a humble way to deal with this matter at the committee stage <e> <s> i then submitted that we were not dealing realistically with the circumstances that would be bound to obtain in many cases if this clause were to be operative <e> <s> it is not quite the situation of guests being conveyed to the noble viscounts table in regard to any banquet which in his generosity he might be prepared to give <e> <s> i tend to think that the noble viscount would be extremely selective in his guestsand indeed he has been so selective so far that i have not been included in their number <e> <s> but of course this is a situation which i ask the house to face realistically <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord goes to another point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i intervene only so that the house gets some clarification <e> <s> if the noble lord opposite were to spend his time lecturing to the transport and general workers union in scotland in regard to their duties under this clause i think that we would be denied the pleasure of his company and his participation in our debates for a very long time <e> <s> i am afraid that the house has heard so far that there have been many examples of what a driver might be expected to do <e> <s> presumably on short journeys he is expected not to stopand on long journeys he is expected to stop <e> <s> would the noble lord before he finishes with the point indicate what certainty there is in regard to this clause so that the average sensible driver would know what was expected of him <e>", "<cs> my lords as the original question dealt with the cost to the taxpayer will the noble viscount tell the house the cost to the taxpayer of what is now fast becoming the longest stoppage post-warand will he indicate when the government will have the courage and the decency to intervene in order to stop what is something completely damaging to the whole of our industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise the wonderment with which this house is witnessing the number of subjects which he is able to cover <e> <s> as a result does he realise that it is leading to the under-employment of his front bench <e> <s> is that consistent with the governments general employment policy <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the poor minister who has now had about five interventions in the midst of a speech which i am sure she meant to be helpful but which so far has not been <e> <s> i want to make two points to her most respectfully <e> <s> the first one is a very blunt point <e> <s> i speak with some knowledge having been for over years associated with the governorships of comprehensive schools in the london area <e> <s> if there is any complaint at all by people who are parents in a school it is that and i am using the word advisedly and i may be attacked for it political hacks are too often put on governing bodies with political parties actually calling for volunteers in their midst who would want to sit as governors of schools and say they are governors <e> <s> when we are looking at a new education bill it is time that we gave some guidance <e> <s> we are asking for no more in this connection <e> <s> that is item number one <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord the minister is not in the position of a little fish faced by whales <e> <s> he is endeavouring very hard to play the part of king canute <e> <s> he is asking the waves to roll hack but they will not roll back <e> <s> i should like the minister to know that from these back-benches in the same way as from the tory back-benches quite apart from the front benches there is unanimous support for lord reigates first amendment upon the basis that all of us want this not and i thought this was an unhappy phrase in order that the fund may have spurious elegance but so that it may have genuine national prestige <e> <s> that is what we all want and i hope the minister will realise before he replies that there is not one noble lord who has risen who is in support of the point of view that he has advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that king canute would make this appointment but i must make this defence for myself <e> <s> king canute did ask the waves to go back though only because some foolish people asked him to do so <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord the minister is in exactly the same position <e>", "<cs> before the minister makes up his mind finally on this matter which is very important would he consider it with some of the clarity of thought with which he usually indulges the house but on this occasion has failed to do so <e> <s> as i understand it his main point is that we are dealing with the exercising by a local authority of its discretion that that discretion ought to be a very wide and unlimited one when it comes to the question of the appointment of governors <e> <s> i certainly do not bow to anybody in this chamber if i may say so with humility although the phrase did not start off with humility on the point of view of respect for the powers of local government <e> <s> i believe i am entitled to say that <e>", "<cs> before the minister rises i wonder whether i might add to the very precise speech just made by my noble friend <e> <s> he did at the very end say something that i am sure he would want to correct <e> <s> knowing him as i do and his wish always to be correct may i point it out to him <e> <s> he read out trade union and/or employers <e> <s> i am sure that he did not mean to add the word or <e> <s> therefore it is trade unions and employers <e>", "<cs> many of us are intrigued by the same point as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has raised <e> <s> the mind boggles at some examples that might be produced if this were legislated for in the present form <e> <s> it can of course be altered <e> <s> i have in mind a submission by some ingenious lawyer that as a governor had had five hours and five minutes in-service training all the acts that he performed after that were <e>", "<cs> may i take it that the noble minister has not answered the point of amendment no <e> <s> because she intends to do so when i formally move it <e> <s> if so of course i have no complaint <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be tidier in view of the question which was addressed to my noble friend lady stewart if i shortly reply to the points made by the minister when amendment no <e> <s> is movedbut it will not be in the course of a long speech that i shall do so <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to deal with the point made by lord alexander so that the committee should not be confused <e> <s> i did not suggest and would not suggest that the duties and powers in regard to specific schools in respect of grounds or whatever it may be should be laid before parliament by regulation <e> <s> i was merely saying that the regulations should contain a little sentence which would be clear to everybody stating that where the grounds are in the ownership and care of the school it is for the governors as part of their duties and powers to deal with them <e> <s> there is no difficulty on this score <e> <s> the desirability of uniformity is greater than the small difficulty of using wording to indicate that where these matters fall within the <e>", "<cs> my lords only so that the house should feel that there would be no possibility of unnecessary delay having heard the noble lord say that two ministers who were named in the previous debate were now consulting with the prime minister and since the only alteration would be that the prime minister would have to consult with the ministers could they merely rearrange their seats and get on with the job <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add <e>", "<cs> may my riposte be as brief as the speech i made in moving the amendment <e> <s> it is wonderful for legislators to be able to refer back to other clauses and subsequent clauses and procedures under other actsbut those who have to carry out this act and those who wish to read and know what their rights are want to look at a section which is a comprehensive section <e> <s> if this happens to be covered either directly or indirectly by other sections or other legislation is there any harm at all if it be repeated in this clause in order to make the matter transparently clear <e>", "<cs> may i put it the other way and then withdraw the amendment unless anybody else wishes to address the committee <e> <s> if the noble lord would be good enough to take this back between now and report stage and if he is convinced by the reasoning of the parliamentary draftsman that this is otiose and comes back at report stage and says so i shall naturally have to give serious consideration to what he then says <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the great advantages of listening to two speeches which make your points far better than you are able to do is that you can then sit down and say i propose to divide the committee and i do <e>", "<cs> the minister has behaved with his usual courtesy <e> <s> indeed i am inspired looking at the right reverend prelates opposite to quote the prayer blessed be the lord by day and blessed be the lord by night at this time but obviously having heard his explanations though they have not if i may say so quite satisfied me i will not at this stage press these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments of the minister on the first amendment and i do not propose to carry that discussion any further <e> <s> with regard to the second i feel comforted that he too shared the same apprehensions <e> <s> it there <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to supplement what my noble friend has said in summarised form <e> <s> the clause deals with premises and many of us who have been connected with voluntary <e>", "<cs> that is exactly the point i was trying to make if the noble lord lord james would permit a further intervention so that he could deal with the matter <e> <s> i was going to ask him whether he felt he was on a rather dangerous course bearing in mind the views that i know he so sincerely holds <e> <s> if it be a fact that in the private sector of education there are sufficient teachers to whom the bright pupils can be sent whether it be to learn chemistry because in the schools in which they are no chemistry is taught or mathematics or whatever is not the logical end to the course which he is pursuing one which i should have thought he would not advocate <e> <s> namely <e> <s> that in order to get proper education for the nation the private sector which has these teachers should be incorporated in the public sector and then there would presumably be places and teachers available in order to satisfy the needs of the brighter pupils <e> <s> i must say that i should have thought that was not a course in logic that the noble lord was advocating but is not that the logical conclusion of his argument <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient in view of what the minister has said if i now move amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name <e> <s> through the courtesy of the noble lord lord wigoder and the noble lord lord vaizey neither of whose faces however tired i see before me it was arranged that my amendment should come first <e> <s> the reason for it is that mine is an omnibus amendment in the sense that it deals with professional grants and does not single out either solicitors or barristers <e> <s> may i at once state an interest in at least one of those professions <e>", "<cs> we are <e>", "<cs> i recognise the lateness of the hour but i thought i was asked to deal with amendment no <e> <s> as it is in the group of amendments <e>", "<cs> and i am trying to do that <e> <s> it would save a great deal of time if i were not interrupted needlessly <e> <s> during the early hours of this morning we heard a great deal about the need to encourage bright pupils <e> <s> some people <e>", "<cs> i cannot say how disappointed i am at that reply especially in view of what dr boyson said during the committee stage in another place <e> <s> it is so surprising because when we were discussing the question of handicapped children and special schools about which so many of us felt so deeply and i am sure she did too i can remember the minister saying that it was really impossible to put a provision in a bill which would last for many years and make it only a transitional item <e> <s> now we hear that although this is going into a bill which is supposed to last for very many years the noble baroness is not prepared to include a provision even though it may only have to take effect in a few years <e>", "<cs> i think it is absolutely excusable that on friday of this week noble lords speeches are made and are not necessarily understood <e> <s> therefore i make no complaint whatsoever when i remind the minister that the first point i made is one that he has not dealt with at all <e> <s> that is the question of charging adults over the age of for the supply of this uniform instead of as is the present position charging the parents <e> <s> i understand perfectly i think we are all a litle tired that the minister may not have understood that that was the reason i gave for my amendment <e>", "<cs> i dare not try your lordships patience too much <e> <s> i can only say that we are talking about an education bill <e> <s> i in the course of my not too successful education learned the art of precis and i hope i said in three sentences precisely what the minister said this clause means and what the present practice is <e> <s> my question still remains unanswered but i do not want to test your lordships patience any more <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for that explanation on subsection which relates also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when we reach that amendment i shall take appropriate action <e> <s> however in regard to amendment no <e> <s> i am afraid that i must ask the committee to divide <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that last indication <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>"]
