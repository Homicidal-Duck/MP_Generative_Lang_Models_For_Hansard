["<cs> my lords in his opening speech my noble friend lord gowrie was i thought rather dismissive of the three dismissed railwaymen at strasbourg <e> <s> i think he will find that that case will not be so easily disposed of nor will its consequences <e> <s> i believe this because that case intimately effects our treaty rights particularly our treaty obligations in the council of europe and under the european convention on human rights <e> <s> i should like to take a little of the time of the house to explain why i think so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble and learned lord for that economical answer may i ask whether he realises that as the employment bill will be again before the house next week it is very important that the government on this important matter which affects the human rights of three railwaymen whose complaints have been found substainable by the commission should be in a position to tell their attitude to human rights in general and to the commissions report in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords further to those supplementary questions may i ask the lord chancellor whether he is continuing to ride two divergent horses the horse which was contended at strasbourg by the solicitor-general and the horse that the complaints will be remedied <e> <s> is he aware that he cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be for the convenience of the committee if we discuss the amendments mentioned in one debate <e> <s> i referred at second reading to the report of the european commission on human rights which has been published since the debate on second reading in fact on th june <e> <s> from that report we have some very valuable leads which will assist us in considering the contents of the employment bill which is before us and in particular the clause now under discussion <e>", "<cs> i rely on a majority and i hope the house relies on a majority still <e> <s> if mr fawcett the president of the court dissents then the court will be able to consider his judgment <e> <s> if as the noble and learned lord suggests i must give equal weight to the minority i hope that he will do so in the case which i am bringing before the committee <e>", "<cs> i think it would be convenient for the committee if the noble lord would make his speech in turn <e> <s> i am making my speech on the assumptions that i have given to the committee and noble lords must judge <e> <s> i understand the noble lords anxiety but he must restrain himself until i finish <e>", "<cs> it is courteous for the noble lord to wait <e> <s> it was not a question but a statement and i listened to the end <e> <s> i resume <e> <s> the commission therefore rejected the argument of both governments that a finding according to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will agree that the amendment which i supported with others has provoked a very interesting debate and we have had a very interesting speech from the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack <e> <s> i have argued with him many times in private and in public and i hold him in the highest regard and affection but generally in his argument he succeeds in convincing one of ones ignorance to begin with if not of ones malintention <e> <s> i have studied the convention <e> <s> i have done my best to understand it <e> <s> i used the words of the convention because i think that in legislating in parliament as a member of the council of europe we ought to pay particular attention to what the convention says <e> <s> if the court has not decided when we are legislating on a matter which is germane we ought to pay attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer and i am grateful for the offer of consideration <e> <s> when considering the question and the problem will he and his colleagues remember that union management agreements both impose duties and confer rights on both parties <e> <s> will he remember that it is of importance particularly to workers to know as precisely as possible when an agreement has terminated so that they know the implications and how their rights and duties are affected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a short intervention simply on the code of practice on the closed shop <e> <s> in the preliminary draft which the employment secretary issued some months ago he included this statement regarding the closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords since the court of human rights in strasbourg decided under article of the convention that the question of material losses legal expenses non-material damage both pecuniary <e>", "<cs> with great respect i have been in the house for years and i have never heard a more abusive and unconstitutional speech in my life in this house <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will cease otherwise i shall have to move that he be no longer heard <e>", "<cs> withdraw <e>", "<cs> in rising to support what the noble lord lord george-brown has said may i take up some words which i think were used by the noble viscount on the front bench that you cannot prevent an employer from sacking a man <e> <s> it is perfectly true that you cannot stop paying his wages but before the act it became a matter of common law <e> <s> the man who was dismissed because he insisted on sticking to his professional standards against trade union pressure had the right to sue his employer for improper dismissal and all the consequences which flowed from it <e> <s> the concept of fair and unfair dismissal arose out of the donaldson report <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to that is that the damages are not settled under the compensation clause <e> <s> they are settled by judges and they may be very heavy indeed <e>", "<cs> i do not want in any way to diminish the effect of what the noble lord lord houghton has said <e> <s> i hope he will not take my support from another point of view <e> <s> articles and of the european convention of human rights bear on this <e> <s> article says <e>", "<cs> it is not my view <e> <s> it is the view of the convention <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get into a detailed argument about the judgment of the court <e> <s> i do not accept lord wedderburns remarks about it <e> <s> i rest upon the fact that we acceded to the european convention of human rights <e> <s> under the labour government <e> <s> individual applications were allowed <e> <s> i argued in the debates that under the convention the closed shop was not permitted <e> <s> i still argue that <e> <s> if we are going to say that we accept the convention but not the judgments that is one argument <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would tell us whether he does <e> <s> if he does not submit to the jurisdiction of the european court and of the commission then we should know <e> <s> the judgment of the european court in this matter was <e>", "<cs> seldom have i heard two more conservative speeches from noble lords on either side of the committee <e> <s> in many ways i agree with many of the comments made by noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> we must face the facts as they are <e> <s> trade unions have become more powerful and in relation the workers have become weaker <e> <s> in many other spheres of life we have insisted that ordinary people should be fully informed about this their rights and obligations <e> <s> this is an important right and obligation and as things exist now there is no reason why the worker should not have the terms of his contract explained to him and in his possession <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply may i point out to him <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend why the government did not accept the opinion of the commission and reach a friendly settlement on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his solicitude <e> <s> is the minister aware that an adequate pension for all holders of the victoria cross is unlikely to be an effective deterrent in the very exceptional circumstances in which a holder is minded to offer his decoration for sale <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that the great majority of holders of the vc believing as he has rightly said that the value of their award cannot be measured in monetary terms would not wish for an increased pension on the grounds proposed by my noble friend or indeed on any other grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i think most of us agree that this is a timely debate we are grateful to the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> there have been many developments in broadcasting and the bbc has enjoyed its privileged position for no less than years <e> <s> i well remember the debate in this house in the early s when it was proposed that parliament should license commercial television <e> <s> i shall never forget how lord reith with the zeal of an old testament prophet resisted that proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his reply does it signify that up-to-date customs clearance for passengers to london on the fast rail link will not be in place by the time that link comes into service <e> <s> if so are we to expect the institution of an archaic post-journey system at the london terminal a system which has long since been superseded on continental cross-border trains <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord kimball and the right reverend prelate my prime concern in considering this report is the future of the british pub <e> <s> of course i do not ignore what my noble friend lord orr-ewing said about clubs but as the right reverened prelate said in the country and also in the town the pub is a social institution of prime importance <e> <s> what worries me is that the mmc does not seem to have addressed itself to the social importance of the pub nor does it connect as did the right reverend prelate the practice of breweries of maintaining marginally profitable or even unprofitable public houses in some areas as being a valuable social contribution <e>"]
