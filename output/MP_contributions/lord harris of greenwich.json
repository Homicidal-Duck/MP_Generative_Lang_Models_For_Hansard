["<cs> my lords i intend to make a fairly non-partisan speech today which probably means that i shall incur the displeasure of virtually all sides of the house but i think it is appropriate to do this in a debate of this character <e> <s> i thought once or twice during the speech of the noble lord lord cockfield that i should not succeed in this objective particularly when he made his allusion to mr david lloyd georges budget of <e> <s> i think that it is slightly overstating the case to suggest that this country went to the dogs on the day when that budget was introduced <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble lord would seriously suggest that this country would be a far more agreeable place in which to live if we had neither an old age pension nor national insurance <e> <s> therefore as i said i parted company with him when he made that allusion <e> <s> i suppose that there are some in germany who would take the view that germany went to the dogs when bismarck introduced social insurance in germany in the th century and there are certainly many in the united states who take the view that america has seen nothing but ugly days since the introduction of the new deal by franklin roosevelt <e> <s> however having made that reference and having assumed at the time that the noble lord lord byers would join me in defending mr lloyd georges budget i now pass on to the substance of the chancellors proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the foreign secretary whether he is aware that many of us in all parts of the house very much welcome his statement that the responsibility for this very grave situation is entirely that of the government of vietnam and of nobody else <e> <s> may i also ask whether he would not agree that it would be particuarly helpful if many of those who have consistently supported the case of the regime in vietnam would join their voices with those of many of the rest of us in applying pressure to the government of vietnam for them to accept their international responsibilities <e> <s> lastly may i ask whether the statement on the conference could be made before the house rises for the summer recess <e>", "<cs> may i press the minister on that last reply my lords which i am not totally sure i understood <e> <s> would he not accept that the governments who have experienced this huge wave of refugees must take first priority so far as any additional aid is concerned <e> <s> is he not aware that many people in this country understanding as they do the situation explained by the minister today about existing contracts nevertheless feel deep unease about british money going to support a rgime which has murdered tens of thousands of its own citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the exchanges that have taken place this afternoon demonstrate the urgent need to increase the regional funds available to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the foreign secretary for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that those of us who take the view that it is necessary to exercise restraint over public expenditure would be less than honest were we to say that any service in which we had a particular interest should be sacrosanct when it comes to a review <e> <s> however having said that i should like to put two specific points to the noble lord <e> <s> first is he aware that many of us would take the view that a withdrawal of the foreign language services to eastern europe would cause many of us the gravest anxiety <e> <s> secondly is he aware that following suggestions in the press that there might be some withdrawal of foreign language services to south-west europe many of us would be concerned about to take one obvious example the withdrawal of the foreign language service to portugal whom we soon hope to welcome as a full member of the european economic community <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us will be glad to hear that a government statement on this matter is likely before long <e> <s> can he give us an indication of whether or not we are to get this statement before the christmas recess because as my noble friend lady stedman pointed out this matter has been before two governments over the last year and a half <e> <s> is he also aware that the answers which he gave this afternoon indicated the large-scale evasion of this duty which is at the moment taking place <e> <s> is he further aware of the total amount of unnecessary work which is imposed upon the already overburdened magistrates courts as a result of trying to enforce this duty when it would be far more sensible to transfer this to the petrol tax <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord on the government front bench one question about this letter which has been sent to my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and to the leader of the liberal party in this house <e> <s> now that the author of the letter is with us can we perhaps ask someone on the government front bench to answer this particular question <e> <s> is it suggested that the proposed talks should be on the sort of issues which are raised specifically in this bill or as i assume is the case that they should range on rather wider issues <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the foreign secretary whether he is aware that many of us on this side of the house wish to associate ourselves with what the noble lord lord home of the hirsel has just said about the very considerable skill which he personally has displayed during the course of these negotiations <e> <s> may i ask him one additional question i note that the noble lord has suggested that a governor will be going out to rhodesia in the next few days <e> <s> am i to assume that it is likely that british forces will also be going out to rhodesia in the next few days <e> <s> or what arrangements are being made <e> <s> i do not wish to press the foreign <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak very briefly because i did not put my name on the list of speakers although i informed the parliamentary under-secretary that i was going to say a few things this afternoon <e> <s> first of all it gives me great pleasure to follow the noble lord who always takes a very keen interest in matters concerning the police although as he will recognise he has gone rather outside the precise terms of the bill we have before us today <e> <s> he referred to the question of special constables <e> <s> like him i attach the greatest importance to them but i think he is a little unfair in saying that their value is in some way underrated by the police force generally <e> <s> certainly chief constables i know attach the highest importance to them and certainly anything that the present government can do to stimulate recruitment would be very welcome to many of us including the noble lord <e> <s> secondly the noble lord referred to the question of police training and perhaps we may come back to that on some occasion because again it is outside the terms of this particular bill <e> <s> nevertheless like the noble lord i attach the greatest importance to it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord in terms of any future consideration which may be given by the government to any further inquiry into this matter whether he is aware that many of us who have spoken against an inquiry by a joint select committee of both houses would be just as firmly and unequivocally opposed to such a procedure in the future following this statement as we were when the issue was raised earlier this year <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on this group of amendments which we are discussing <e> <s> in moving them the noble lord lord foot made as always a moderate and reasonable speech <e> <s> i do not think that on many occasions in the past i have differed substantially from the central thrust of the noble lords speeches on matters of this kind but i am bound to say that today he did not carry me with him largely for the reasons which have been given by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> however i very much agreed with what the noble lord said about the chief constable of devon and cornwall in the light of a particularly objectionable attack which has just been launched upon him <e> <s> anybody who knows anything about community policing in devon and cornwall as does the noble lord lord foot and i am glad to say that i know something about it too regards the statement which was recently made on this matter by an honourable gentleman in another place as particularly mischievous and as <e>", "<cs> all i would say to the noble lord is that i do know of a great deal of evidence that the police have been thwarted <e> <s> i had a great deal of knowledge of this when i was a minister in the home office for five years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us take the view that one of the most unsatisfactory situations at the moment is the disenfranchisement of british subjects resident in the european community who are not members of the armed forces <e> <s> is this one of the issues that will be taken into account and will there be a white or green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be right for me to begin by declaring an interest <e> <s> it is all the more proper to do so on a day when the noble duke the duke of devonshire managed to do so on no fewer than three occasions in a period of five minutes <e> <s> therefore i do so <e> <s> the chairman of the tote mr wyatt has been a friend of mine for years <e> <s> it is right to say this because mr wyatt and his record as chairman is central to the debate today and also to a great deal of the campaign which has taken place outside this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the noble lord lord wigg to interrupt his own speech because it is only right that the whole house should have the opportunity of being reminded of what he said on that occasion <e> <s> i will begin the sentence again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord maintains his position rather i would not say that i am glad that he maintains it because i regret to say that he maintains it against all the evidence <e> <s> nevertheless i note that he maintains the position which he adopted in <e> <s> it is quite interesting to study what happened in relation to these betting shop acquisitions <e> <s> again the noble lord lord trevethin and oaksey alluded to this and i should like to do so also <e> <s> when the present chairman began acquiring betting shops there were i think <e> <s> now there are but as the noble lord indicated the return on capital is per cent <e> <s> gross <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that the noble lord lord wigg who was heard without interruption could sometimes manage to control himself rather more successfully and not interrupt others from a seated position <e> <s> i should like to continue <e> <s> in the year that mr wyatt became chairman of the tote those betting shops to which i referred a few moments ago were making a loss of some before head office expenses <e> <s> the comparable figure now is a profit in the region of million <e>", "<cs> without having read that judgment my lords i foreshadowed why some of the commotion continues i think there are other explanations for at least some of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak very briefly and i wish to say only this <e> <s> during the period when i was minister of state at the home office in the last administration i had something to do with this problem of tape recording because of the pressure to which the home office was then subjected to have tape recorders introduced into police stations in england and wales and this is one of the matters which i know is being looked at by the royal commission on criminal procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris said nothing of the kind <e> <s> if the noble lord lord foot will look at my remarks in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us warmly welcome the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak only briefly in this debate this evening <e> <s> i thought it right to do so as i was the minister responsible for the passage of the original bill through this house in <e> <s> it seemed to me even more desirable to speak given the fact that in the debate to which the noble lord lord monson has just referred in another place on th march a number of members of my own party chose to speak against the renewal order which was introduced by the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak fairly briefly this evening <e> <s> however before doing so perhaps i should say that i have not hitherto regarded it as proper to intervene in debates on penal policy in the last months given the fact that as chairman of the parole board i should have regarded that as inappropriate <e> <s> however i speak tonight for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that i was involved in a debate in this house with the noble lord lord avebury into the possibility of abolishing penalties of imprisonment for certain offences that <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend he has in no way disposed of the case put by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby and i feel i must comment on this issue <e> <s> i do so with some regret because my noble friend lord underhill and i served at transport house together for a number of years but on this matter we certainly find ourselves in total disagreement <e> <s> i like many noble lords on this side of the committee and no doubt many noble lords opposite have been a member of a trade union for a substantial time <e> <s> however i am bound to say that at the time when i joined my trade union i would have regarded it as a most extraordinary proposition that a man who had a deeply-held personal conviction should notwithstanding that conviction be press-ganged into that trade union <e> <s> after all let us bear in mind what we are talking about here <e> <s> we are talking about unfair dismissal so that in fact not only could he be dismissed but he would have no redress after that dismissal <e> <s> that is after all what we are voting on tonight and i say without the slightest hesitation that i shall vote against the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand very clearly that a statement was made some months ago on this question but can the noble lord tell us what action is now contemplated to be taken by our government and the governments of our european colleagues <e> <s> there are children being shot in the streets there are villagers being attacked by soviet aircraft while they go about their ordinary everyday business <e> <s> is it not time that the western world started to take this matter a great deal more seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak briefly but i think it right to do so though i am aware of the fact that the house would now like to come to a decision <e> <s> i very much agree with the speeches made by my noble friends lady burton and lord robens <e> <s> i want to explain why i propose to vote against this amendment <e> <s> first of all i start from the proposition that this is a moderate bill <e> <s> that is clearly my view <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to raise three issues in this evenings debate first the question of the fourth channel service secondly the issue of public meetings being held by the independent broadcasting authority on the applications for the new contracts and lastly the question of the taxation of independent television companies <e> <s> before doing so i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am the chairman of an independent television company <e> <s> at the same time i must declare a former interest in that for five years i was responsible to two home secretaries for broadcasting policy <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e>", "<cs> my lords all i would say to my noble friend is that the total number we are talking about is eight <e> <s> with great respect to him i listened to his speech with great interest it seems to me that this particular charge really does fall apart <e> <s> we are talking about precisely eight people that is the net number in <e> <s> with great respect it is impossible to take seriously a suggestion that there has been a massive outflow of talented people this is the charge constantly put about from the bbc to independent television when as i have pointed out the number involved is eight <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words following the speech of the parliamentary under-secretary <e> <s> i very much agree with the general thrust of his argument and if the noble viscount were to press his amendment i should unhesitatingly vote against it <e> <s> having had the kind of responsibility that the noble lord lord belstead has had in the home office i am bound to say that the withdrawal from the home secretary of this form of power would in my view be highly disadvantageous to the public interest <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will be aware there is a very substantial feeling in nearly all parts of the committee about this amendment <e> <s> therefore i hope that before the next stage he will look at the matter with his right honourable friend <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is one of considerable importance namely that this is the last time that we shall be looking at the issue so far as this bill is concerned <e> <s> i agree very much with what was said by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter it raises questions of propriety as to whether this house could reject the affirmative resolution when it comes before it <e> <s> it is not good enough to say that we will wait until the regulations are made to find out what is going to be done <e> <s> the house requires some form of guarantee at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> speaking for myself and i suspect for many others we very much hope that the government will then come forward with a proper amendment on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think most of us would agree that in this dispute the right honourable gentleman the home secretary has been faced with a very dangerous situation indeed particularly if i may say so in the local prisons where this problem has been felt most seriously <e> <s> the prison officers association have raised the range of issues which are now the basis of the current dispute as a result of the fact that they did not succeed when they put precisely the same arguments to a committee of inquiry presided over by mr justice may <e> <s> i think that we have a rather unfortunate habit in this country now of rejecting the umpires decision and i think that if the umpires decision had been accepted in this particular case this wretched business would never have been undertaken in the first instance <e> <s> nevertheless they rejected it which i think was particularly unfortunate <e>", "<cs> i should like if i may to say just a few things about this <e> <s> i started off when considering this matter at the beginning very much taking the same view as my noble and learned friend lord gardiner but i am bound to say i have changed my view to some extent as a result of what happened in the sutcliffe case <e> <s> it raises substantial issues which make one go back and consider ones own position very carefully indeed <e> <s> but i am bound to say to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that i am worried if i may go back to clause as to whether this does represent an adequate defence for a newspaper <e> <s> that is because subsection says this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> first is he aware that this closed shop policy was imposed after miss harris and a number of others became employees of the local authority <e> <s> secondly is he aware that it has also been suggested that the action of the local authority is unlawful <e> <s> is that so <e> <s> if their action is unlawful are the noble lords department and that of the secretary of state for the environment proposing to warn this local authority and any others which may be contemplating equally offensive behaviour of this character that they are putting themselves at the risk of a surcharge from the district auditor <e> <s> lastly is the minister aware that a very large number of people in this country regard the behaviour of the local authority as absolutely outrageous in putting this young woman into the position of having to choose between her principles and joining a very very long dole queue and that if in fact matters of this sort cannot be resolved under the present law there will be an overwhelming demand for a change in the law <e>", "<cs> my lords taking up the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is the noble lord aware that the crucial question in this case is whether this young woman can get her job back because compensation is not enough <e> <s> the central question is whether she is going to get that job back <e> <s> at a time of high unemployment it is intolerable that this young woman should be put in this position by a local authority behaving in this grossly totalitarian manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply and hoping that his reply will get a great deal of publicity particularly in the areas of the two local authorities concerned may i invite him to ask the secretary of state for the environment formally to warn the local authorities concerned of what is contemplated <e> <s> does he not agree that what is contemplated in the case of both these local authorities is a disgraceful attack upon the civil liberties of these women who are taking up a position under immense pressure from their employers <e> <s> in this situation is it not right that the members of the local authorities should be formally warned by the government that the government themselves will draw these matters to the attention of the district auditor because only in those circumstances is it likely that they will in fact avoid dismissing these women who then will have only claims for compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this final question if the minister argues as i understand he does that what the local authorities here are doing is unlawful why does the secretary of state for the environment not formally warn members of the local authorities concerned that he will draw these matters to the attention of the district auditor <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak fairly briefly to this order <e> <s> members of the house may recall that i was in fact the minister who introduced the first of the prevention of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e> <s> the noble lord touched on the matter that had been deployed at rather greater length by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> let us at least agree on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as always to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> but i am answering a speech which was put forward by the official opposition in another place <e> <s> they chose to divide the house of commons on the issue <e> <s> i am in fact pointing out why i believe that the recommendation made by the official opposition and voted upon by them as the noble and learned lord may recall was in fact in my view wholly undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> that is the type of courtesy which i have come to expect from her i regret to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord since i have certainly drawn upon the letter today but on th february it was in fact quoted by the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> what on earth has this got to do with what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the characteristic thoroughness with which he has dealt with the issues i raised in my speech and which were raised by other noble lords to whom i should also like to tender my gratitude for having spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware i was never on a ministerial committee that considered this matter <e> <s> that is the answer to the question <e> <s> it affects ministers of all governments <e> <s> it no doubt affected some of my former noble friends when they came into the chamber to listen to me speaking on behalf of the home office <e> <s> ministers have to accept collective responsibility <e> <s> nevertheless the fact is certainly clear that i was a member of a government which did a number of things in the area of trade union reform which i find looking back on them were highly distasteful to put it at the very least <e> <s> i must accept a measure of personal responsibility for having continued in office as a member of that government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister of state aware that many of us take the view that the principal danger to the security of western europe and to britain arises not from the deployment of cruise missiles but from the deployment of large numbers of soviet troops and nuclear weapons in eastern europe <e> <s> secondly is the noble viscount aware that many of us also take the view that one of the most grave risks to the security of the people of this country arises from the activities of those who are warmly in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament which would strip this country of its defences <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words on this matter <e> <s> having listened to the debate i am puzzled <e> <s> the minister pointed out rightly i am sure that a great deal of consideration had been given to this issue <e> <s> i have no doubt that that is so <e> <s> it would not be part of the bill if it was not a matter that the scottish office considered important <e> <s> i still do not understand why the change is made at all <e> <s> is the figure to be eight as is the present law or is it to be six which is what the government propose or is it to be seven as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has proposed <e> <s> i admit that i am a floating voter on this particular grave issue <e> <s> i am waiting for somebody preferably from the government front bench to explain why the change is made at all <e> <s> at the moment i do not think that any of us has heard an explanation <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl lord mansfield will be able to assist us <e> <s> it will be helpful to the committee if he is able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister of state for that reply <e> <s> not making any comment on the aspects of this matter which are <e>", "<cs> rather like the noble viscount i do not see that there is a substantial ideological issue here and i was mildly surprised to hear the minister suggest that there was <e> <s> it seemed to me that the noble lord lord mishcon made a reasonable case <e> <s> he pointed out the relevance of the per cent <e> <s> proposal in this amendment <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord who has just resumed his seat i do not think that any of us doubt that there are very large numbers of very capable high-minded people working in british rail now and no doubt will be in the future <e> <s> the fact is that it is an illusion to imagine that they are entirely free and independent agents <e> <s> they are leant on from time to time by governments of different political persuasions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be good enough to give us some indication as to when the minister is likely to come to a decision on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament would cause far greater risk to the safety of the people of this country than any of the risks which are set out in the question which has been tabled today <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening because in order to answer my question the noble baroness will have to ask for leave of the house once more <e> <s> she said i think on two occasions that subsection of the proposed amendment was outside the scope of the bill and therefore was unacceptable <e> <s> however i am sure she will agree with me that this house unlike another place has the right to change the long title of the bill and therefore there is nothing unacceptable so far as the traditions of this house are concerned in accepting the amendment as drafted on that particular aspect of the matter at least <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us are extremely anxious to ensure a satisfactory settlement to the northern ireland problem but at the moment our principal concern is the catching and conviction of those who have committed these disgraceful offences in the city of london <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble lord whether he will bear in mind that with the death of mr howorth this is the second metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord lord bruce of donington will necessarily welcome the fact that i am springing to his defence <e> <s> nevertheless it is only right to say that i do not think that in this matter the noble lord is guilty of trickery even of technical trickery <e> <s> it seems to me he has done no more than put down a motion which is rather reminiscent in the form of words used of the very weighty complaints made by the noble lord lord carrington when speaking as leader of the opposition when he delivered in my view a wholly well-merited rebuke to the then labour government for producing shoals of amendments at the last stage of the parliamentary year and not giving this house the opportunity of debating them <e> <s> i am bound to say that i sat then on the government front bench and thought that the views expressed by the noble lord lord carrington were wholly justifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> let me say at the outset that i am quite sure the government in meeting some of these points have done extremely well and i am sure we shall all be delighted about that <e> <s> but that is not the point <e> <s> the point is why have over amendments albeit some of them are of a technical character been produced hours before the end of this parliamentary session <e> <s> that is the issue <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord complained of the time <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may follow the noble lord lord wells-pestell in what has become a rather wide-ranging debate and i make no complaint about that on the criminal justice system i do not think that we have a large number of opportunities to direct our attention to this particular series of issues <e> <s> it is by happy accident that we find ourselves in a position to do so today <e> <s> i speak entirely for myself and i support the order moved by the parliamentary under-secretary for two reasons first <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us recognise that with the suggestion that petrol bombs were being manufactured at a time such as that which existed a few months ago in brixton it was perfectly understandable that immediate action was called for from the police <e> <s> but is he also aware that a number of us would prefer to reserve comment on this whole range of issues until the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman which will i think give us a much better opportunity to pronounce on this whole question <e> <s> lastly we are of course in the difficulty of not having had the opportunity of looking at this memorandum and we will presumably have that opportunity later this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i do so only in order simply to correct the record as i was a minister of state when mr rees was home secretary <e> <s> at no stage when he was home secretary did he consider any such proposal as supervised early release <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all accept that the british government have made a significant contribution as have our partners in the european community <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that many of us would feel reassured were there to be some indication given in the fairly near future on the specific question as to whether a small group of administrators could be used to assist the voluntary organisations <e> <s> i welcome the fact that government representatives were present at the meeting yesterday but the need is urgent and as i am sure the minister recognises many of us would be reassured if this matter could be put at the top of the agenda so far as the government are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although recognising that there are problems in terms of administering any controls that might be introduced there is grave anxiety among many chief officers of police about the misuse of glue in the circumstances outlined in the noble baronesss question <e> <s> is the home office involved in discussions within government on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the debate we had on this matter in this house last week the noble lord lord home and the noble lord lord stewart and others pressed the government to take some action to assist british voluntary organisations church bodies and that sort of organisation in the present difficulties which they are encountering in getting desperately needed food and medical supplies through to poland <e> <s> is he aware that many of us would be extremely reassured were he able to take a personal interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply which was phrased in an extremely helpful way i should like to ask him two specific questions <e> <s> first is the noble lord aware that in november a circular was issued by his own department and by the home office specifically suggesting that the police should be invited to case conferences <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that in this particular case the police do not appear to have been invited to the case conference and is that one of the matters which will be subject to investigation <e> <s> secondly in terms of the local authority inquiries which are taking place when the noble lord receives the result of those will he consider placing them in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a further question to the noble lord arising from the question put by the noble baroness <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the association of chief police officers was consulted before the circular was issued in and that therefore it was done with the full knowledge of the service <e> <s> secondly will the noble lord particularly direct his attention to why the terms of this circular were not implemented by the authorities in cambridgeshire <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of the rest of us in this house also welcome the frankness of this statement by the right honourable gentleman the home secretary <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord two specific questions really on the two points he has just dealt with first computers and secondly training <e> <s> first on the point relating to computers and the particular point made in the right honourable gentlemans statement about <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> the proportions are one-third and two-thirds <e>", "<cs> my lords let me begin by saying that i propose to devote the whole of my speech to those aspects of the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman relating to the police <e> <s> in doing so i should i suppose declare an interest of a kind in that i am a trustee of the police foundation with the noble lord lord sieff of brimpton though that foundation has no views on the matters which we are discussing today <e> <s> i should make that clear at the outset <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask the noble lord a question on that i take his point completely of course and i am most grateful to him with his customary courtesy for giving way <e> <s> but the fact is that the noble and learned lord indicated that he wanted a -month training period and was prepared because of the resource implications to accept six months <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that all the police organisations have indicated that they want a six-month training period run within home office training establishments <e> <s> are the government prepared to accept that recommendation if it is indeed the position of all the police organisations as of course i am aware that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to clarify this point <e> <s> it is a very important one and it would be most helpful were he able to be a little more explicit <e> <s> is he saying that a local authority can decide on prohibition as far so these establishments are concerned in its own local authority area <e> <s> that is the point and it is one on which i think we should all value the advice of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords having been responsible for introducing the and the bills to the house i should like to speak briefly and to welcome on behalf of my noble friends the decision of the home secretary to invite the noble earl lord jellicoe to conduct the inquiry <e> <s> i think that four years after the inquiry by the noble lord lord shackleton is about right <e> <s> i think that the home secretary has been right to ask the noble earl lord jellicoe with <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to ask a question on this matter which i am sure fills us all with considerable interest <e> <s> can he explain what would be the attitude of a future labour government to the miners superannuation fund and other funds of that kind which had invested in such stocks as we are now considering <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she is aware that many of us are grateful for the fact that all the statements made in another place have been repeated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for long but shall very briefly in making my maiden speech in this series of debates on the falkland islands refer to a few points which have occurred to me during the debate and indeed before it took place <e> <s> i say that in particular in relation to the interesting speech made by the noble lord lord jenkins some elements of which he will be surprised to learn i agreed with although on the substance of the argument i do not think i did <e> <s> certainly i agreed with him that we should act with restraint <e> <s> that is absolutely right <e> <s> secondly i think it would be foolish <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords but the united nations argument has been put very firmly both in this house and another place <e> <s> i agree that the economic option is important and i rejoice that we have received such a high degree of support from our allies in the european community <e> <s> it is lucky that we are members of the eec and it is unfortunate that there are some in this country who underrate the significance of british membership of the european community <e> <s> this is a classic illustration of europe standing together on a matter of supreme importance to the interests of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in what the noble earl says <e> <s> all i would say is that speaking for myself i think that the word paramountcy is not a particularly suitable word to use <e> <s> parliament must decide this matter i think that parliament is the right place for it to be determined <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord bellwin and the noble baroness lady birk will forgive me for intervening in this extremely interesting series of exchanges between them may i raise one or two slightly broader questions and explain why my noble friends and i will be voting for this amendment though without necessarily the same degree of enthusiasm as the official opposition <e> <s> most of us recognise that there is a real problem <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding amendment no <e> <s> the home office have responsibility to ensure that the scale of fines is appropriate <e> <s> i should like to know on what basis the figure of has been agreed <e> <s> i am in favour of these amendments but i find the maximum figure surprising <e> <s> i should like to know on what basis it has been agreed and how it compares with other maximum fines under other licensing laws <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with the leave of the house put the point again i am well aware of the other amendments <e> <s> i am asking in particular how this scale of penalty compares with other offences of a similar character in relation to other licensing laws <e> <s> the parliamentary under-secretary will be aware that there is a responsibility on his department to ensure that there is some degree of consistency of approach so far as maximum fine levels are concerned <e> <s> i am asking what is the comparison with other licensing law offences <e>", "<cs> with great respect the noble viscount asked what seemed to me to be a perfectly reasonable question as to whether this could be taken into account <e> <s> i do not think we have asked the minister a great deal today and certainly if we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for that answer <e> <s> it presumably means that government amendments will be put down in another place <e> <s> may i express my great pleasure in the reply given by the noble and learned lord and ask two questions <e> <s> first would he agree as his answer implies that it is a very serious matter when people who have been convicted on or separate occasions ate entitled to serve on juries and are only now not subject to imprisonment because of the extension of the range of non-custodial penalties in the past few years <e> <s> secondly is the noble and learned lord aware of the disturbing amount of evidence admittedly anecdotal of tampering with juries particularly in london where it is suggested that bribes have been offered to individual jurors <e> <s> is he aware that this is causing a great deal of disquiet among many members of the bar and others concerned with the administration of justice in london <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton with his customary graciousness has indicated that the answer he has just given is not very satisfactory and with that most of us would agree <e> <s> he is arguing today that it is desirable to maintain detention centres in a separate existence and that is an arguable proposition about which a valid argument could no doubt be made on both sides <e> <s> he was then pressed by the noble lord lord wigoder to say what had happened in relation to the short sharp shock sentence and he has been unable to give any clear indication about that except to say that he will correspond with lord wigoder and others at some later stage to tell them what the results have been of the analysis <e> <s> being well used to debates in this house the minister will recognise that that is not a very satisfactory position <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to be reassured on that and let us hope that on report we shall be able to have that information <e> <s> i would remind the minister that no serious argument was ever made for the introduction of the sentence in the first instance there was no serious criminolgical or social research which ever justified it <e> <s> it was an ill-considered phrase in a weekend speech and that is the basis of the short sharp shock <e> <s> i suggest that we are entitled to have an early answer as to what is the result of the research that has taken place <e> <s> i hope it is being carried out by the home office research unit which has a substantial reputation <e> <s> the minister has indicated that we shall have the information and i hope that every effort will be made to make sure that we have it by report when we shall be able to return to the matter and see what the result of the study has been <e>", "<cs> may i go back to the point on which the noble lord was so helpful a few moments ago <e> <s> as i understand the assurance that he has given the committee it is that before the report stage or at the report stage he will bring to the house all the information that is available about the trial rgime at the particular detention centres <e> <s> as i understand his argument he goes further than that <e> <s> he said that it is not just a question of the statistics involved <e> <s> referring to what the noble lord lord wigoder had said he went on to say that it is not just a question of statistics there are other matters of an unspecified character with which he will be able to assist your lordships when we reach the report stage <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene briefly i would say that though i accept that the noble lord lord mottistone has raised a matter of importance i believe that there are arguments of principle against what he is proposing <e> <s> as i understand it the court would have the opportunity to extend a period of custody to ensure that a course of treatment is completed <e> <s> i speak subject to correction from the minister but i know of no provision in the english law which has ever given a court such a power <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has if i may say so given a most reasonable reply and on the basis of what he has just said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord elton one question on his announcement concerning the curfew <e> <s> it is an important announcement he has made today and a number of us would want to consider it before coming to a conclusion as to our views on this particular proposition <e> <s> it would be helpful before the report stage of the bill to have some indication of what the balance of force has been in terms of the advice given to the government in this matter <e> <s> as i understood the noble lord he indicated that a large number of organisations had been consulted and properly so <e> <s> what a number of us would be interested to know is the position of those organisations and not at the report stage but before the report stage <e> <s> i n order to assist the noble lord in this respect i will put down a question and i hope he will be able to answer it before the report stage of the bill so that the house can be informed on this particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister a little following the question of the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> may i put it to him that it was an extraordinary reply to say that a written answer may be given in another place <e> <s> is the noble lord not prepared to give us the information in the house today <e> <s> i do not begin to understand how it is right to be entirely dependent on a written answer in another place before we can have the information which has been asked for in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us take the view that this is very a sad day for the railway industry and a very sad day for the national union of railwaymen which has now embarked on an industrial dispute which it stands no prospect whatever of winning and will only inflict great hardship on many members of the travelling public especially in london <e> <s> is the minister aware as i am sure he is that in the last few days great hardship has been caused to many people in london as a result of the industrial action taken on the london undergound and that this is undoubtedly causing a great deterioration of relations which in the past have been excellent between members of the travelling <e>", "<cs> may i join briefly in the appeal made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> as the minister recognised in the speech which he made the point about criteria was discussed at some length at an earlier stage of the committee proceedings on the bill and by a decisive majority it rejected the view of the government and decided to proceed in the way that it did <e> <s> it seems to me to follow that the minister should consider again rather more carefully the argument which the noble lord lord mishcon and others have put to him <e> <s> i do not think that any of us would wish necessarily to defend the precise language of let us say paragraph <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would he good enough to allow me to ask a question <e> <s> i am trying to understand the distinction he is drawing and of course there is a distinction between a care order where a young person finds himself in some form of residential accommodation and a normal custodial sentence <e> <s> i recognise that there is a distinction but what happens when the young person absconds from that establishment <e> <s> what then happens to him <e>", "<cs> i propose to speak briefly <e> <s> the reply of the minister does not answer <e>", "<cs> i think it is right to say just one or two things on this issue as i was a home office minister at the time the criminal law act was put on to the statute book and i believe the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones introduced the second reading of that bill in this chamber where the bill actually began its parliamentary passage <e> <s> i should like to look at the background of this for the following reasons <e> <s> first this amendment was a back-bench amendment tabled in another place by the present minister of state at the home office mr mayhew <e> <s> it was accepted by the government after discussion in standing committee <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words to assist the noble lord <e> <s> because i am sure he wants to address the committee on only a limited number of occasions this evening <e> <s> we understand his concern on this matter but i must just put to him the point that my noble friend lord donaldson has just made <e> <s> this is an entirely non-partisan measure <e> <s> the speeches that have been made have been very nearly equal in number and very appropriately so from both sides of the committee <e> <s> indeed i think that if the amount of time taken up by members on both sides were compared it would be seen that they were pretty nearly equal and i repeat that is right <e>", "<cs> i agree with a point made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway who has just left us no doubt for a moment or two <e> <s> i agree with him that this form of supervised release is not <e>", "<cs> no we have not in my view <e> <s> we could all argue about it as indeed we have been arguing for some time but the problem with that section of the criminal law act is that there is a good deal of argument about the effect of its implementation <e> <s> as i tried to say a little time ago many people believe that it will lead to an increase in the prison population <e> <s> i am not saying that is a certainty but it is a gamble as my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> having spoken in favour of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hunt i indicated that i was not prepared to agree to this particular amendment and i want briefly to explain why <e> <s> i have been in the position when a home office minister of considering this with my right honourable friend on more than one occasion <e> <s> we did what no doubt the present government did in terms of the supervised early release scheme consulted a large number of interested parties magistrates the judiciary and so on <e> <s> we came to the conclusion that to introduce per cent <e> <s> remission in england and wales would have the consequence of leading to an increase in periods of imprisonment <e> <s> clearly one cannot demonstrate that one is right or wrong but nevertheless it was our judgment <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that your lordships will accept the motion as i assume it is that the house be resumed <e> <s> if the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply may i congratulate him on behalf of the house on the occasion of his first appearance at the front bench <e> <s> i should like to put to him one or two questions arising from his answer <e> <s> first does he agree that what he has disclosed is an extremely menacing situation whereby heroin seizures in were more than double those of and it appears at the moment that we are running at double the rate of last year <e> <s> secondly is he aware that it is accepted by the authorities concerned that only or per cent <e> <s> of the heroin entering this country is intercepted and that therefore we are facing a situation in which the illicit heroin trade is increasing at a very dangerous level indeed <e> <s> that being so what steps do the government propose to take to deal with this in terms of strengthening both the investigative branch of the customs and excise and also the uniformed staff so that they can be targeted to deal with this very serious situation <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will forgive me for interrupting i hope that it will be too <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord windlesham is now as chairman of the parole board not really capable of answering for himself let me just say that what the noble earl is saying here really has absolutely no basis in reality whatever <e> <s> members of the parole board regularly visit prisons and regularly talk to inmates <e>", "<cs> speaking as has been pointed out already on the first day for some little time that i have not been chairman of the parole board perhaps i can say a few words about this amendment and explain why i propose to vote against it <e> <s> i am sorry to find myself in disagreement with my noble friend lord donaldson and with my absent noble friend lord hunt <e> <s> but nevertheless i am firmly opposed to this amendment and i will try to explain to the committee why that is so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right in general or partially right for a very small number of cases category a prisoners have been released <e> <s> but there is a great deal of pressure on the prison administration to reduce the classification in such cases so that their cases can be looked at more advantageously as far as the individual inmate is concerned <e> <s> the point is that you start looking after years and getting the wheels turning <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury cannot have it both ways <e> <s> if it is wrong to deny all hope which i understand is the purpose behind this amendment what the noble lord is saying is that people in this category have no hope have no expectation that they will be released then the point that i must put is this <e> <s> the relatives of that man the wife and the other members of the family will have their expectations raised and there is no point i think with the greatest of respect in trying to pretend the reverse because one finds cases constantly cases to which ones attention is drawn where expectations have been raised and there is a deep anguish in the family when they discover that the man is not to be released and in some cases may not be released for many years <e> <s> that is the problem <e>", "<cs> my noble friend may recall that he rose to ask a question and i rose to answer the question <e> <s> i have met dozens of life-sentence prisoners and have spoken to them often <e>", "<cs> if i may begin by making two observations first on my rather well publicised departure as chairman of the parole board i would like to thank those noble lords who made observations on this and my old parliamentary colleague lord <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point of course but that is not the issue <e> <s> the issue is whether or not she wants him home and whether or not she is prepared to have him home <e> <s> the real difficulty in cases this sort and i must repeat it because it lies at the centre of this argument is that it is often the case that there is a long history of battery by the husband against that woman and often against the children in the house as well <e> <s> the central issue facing us is whether or not he has a stable home to go to and if not whether there are any alternative arrangements that can be made for him <e>", "<cs> may i before that is done put one point to the noble earl <e> <s> let me reassure him about the unity of the labour party on this issue <e> <s> the last three labour home secretaries have always resisted precisely the amendment he has tabled this evening <e>", "<cs> i concede at once that the government have moved to some extent as a result of the amendment put down in another place <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord elton that the government must consider the resource implications which is a significant issue so far as the probation service is concerned and i also recognise the fact that he must have his consultations <e> <s> i have no disposition to introduce unfair arguments but i think he will be aware of the sense of disappointment in the committee that the government have in this bill so far taken no clear steps to reduce the appaling numbers in prison <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord has said and i am sure that he will take note of what i have said and what others have said <e> <s> i do not propose to put down this amendment at the report stage but at the third reading so that he will <e>", "<cs> i am attracted by the proposal of the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> speaking for myself i want to consult a number of my noble friends <e> <s> that is the approach which we may actually consider adopting if we decided to put down an amendment on third reading <e> <s> i repeat to the minister and i do not think it has to be said again but let it be done for the record that he is aware of the sense of urgency regarding this matter in the committee <e> <s> he has communicated his own concern <e> <s> what we shall definitely want on third reading is some clear indication of substantial progress in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put two points to the minister <e> <s> first is he aware that many of us take the view that at a time like this it is absolutely right to support the position of the chairman of british railways given the totally intransigent position of aslef over a very substantial period of time <e> <s> my second question is one which i put to the noble earls noble friend when he made a statement earlier this week <e> <s> what action is being taken within government departments to ensure that hours are in fact going to be staggered in the way that he suggested should be done <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief in agreeing with the noble lords lord donaldson and lord wigoder <e> <s> i appreciate the arguments that motivate the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones but i hope the government will stand firm on this matter and i have a slight suspicion that they may <e> <s> anyone who visits prisons hears repeatedly from governors about cases where men who are desperate not to go through the routine of eight day remands nevertheless have to do it despite the fact that no earthly purpose will be served by it <e> <s> we should rightly devote some attention to the case of men who may not be legally represented but that is dealt with in schedule as a result of my own observations of the situation in our prisons particularly in the local prisons which are especially affected <e> <s> the rgimes in those prisons are grievously affected because of the demands made on staff to escort prisoners to all parts of the kingdom often wholly unnecessarily <e> <s> i regard the bill as an advance and i hope the government will maintain their position <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord totally followed the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> this piece of legislation will be mandatory whereas the rule is not mandatory <e> <s> that is a distinction <e> <s> the noble lord is missing the point altogether <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady wootton <e> <s> to be blunt i have heard the argument used by the minister for a long time even before he was presented with his brief and it does not sound any better now than when i first heard it <e> <s> i tried to make this change when i was a minister at the home office but did not succeed because of opposition from some of the interested parties who were consulted through certainly not the probation service <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness goes further may i ask the noble lord lord elton in view of the number of appeals that have been made on this subject if he would at least agree to look at the matter again before report of course without giving a final commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is by no means an isolated case that there is a large mental hospital in the thames valley where exactly the same problem is arising <e> <s> does he accept that there are some wider implications so far as this question is concerned about the need to safeguard the delivery of the royal mail when the position is that the safety of the lives of many patients is clearly involved <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord gowrie will remember that he and i participated in a debate on precisely this issue some time ago when he was minister of state at the department of employment when i raised the question of the dismissal of miss joanna harris by the local authority in sandwell and subsequently in the course of that debate referred to the wholly outrageous behaviour of the walsall labour-controlled local authority which was persecuting part-time dinner ladies who were earning and a week <e> <s> i find what the government are doing here right <e> <s> i think it would have been wholly wrong for the government to ignore the deliberate defiance of the law by two local authorities who knew precisely their legal obligations and decided quite coldly and deliberately to defy and ignore those obligations <e> <s> it seems to me that parliament has an absolute obligation to defend the interests of people who were treated in this shameful fashion <e> <s> i very much agree therefore with the general thrust of the governments argument <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i could make a few remarks in view of his brief but gracious remarks addressed to me at an earlier stage <e> <s> of course one objects deeply to racial discrimination in employment and to sexual discrimination in employment <e> <s> both are offensive <e> <s> of course discrimination exists in both respects the noble baroness lady seear is entirely right <e> <s> it may be that at some stage it will be right to look at the levels of <e>", "<cs> may i say a few friendly words to the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> i do not in any way mind the teasing of the sdp or the alliance <e> <s> i am quite sure that the liberal party approach it in an equally robust fashion <e>", "<cs> i believe that this debate has been of great value to the committee <e> <s> the more we go on the clearer it becomes that there is a fundamental gulf which lies between those who are in favour of this clause as we are on these benches and those in the labour party who are most passionately opposed to it <e>", "<cs> a number of my noble friends are trying to encourage me not to reply to the noble lord because i might take marginally more than seconds to do so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord wedderburn could assist us in one matter <e> <s> i realise that he was speaking as briefly as possible on this clause <e> <s> i think he suggested that the clause represented some breach of an international obligation so far as the british government were concerned <e> <s> i am not clear whether he was referring to the european convention on human rights or to some other international obligation on this point <e> <s> it would be helpful if he could assist us in the matter in order to give the noble and learned lord the lord advocate the opportunity of answering this point <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will take the matter slightly more seriously <e> <s> he made a point of substance when he said that in this connection there had in the past been no problems <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy made a perfectly valid point in answer but the noble earl regards a joke as being an appropriate way of dealing with the issue <e> <s> he and i and others have spent an agreeable period this evening in the same lobby on a number of issues in this bill and my noble friends and i do not <e>", "<cs> let me asure the noble earl lord ferrers at once that i am delighted to hear what he said about this consultative document <e> <s> i do not find it amazing <e> <s> i find it a very understandable acceptance on the governments part that there is overwhelming support for this view both by the general public of that there can be no serious doubt whatever and as all public opinion polls demonstrate from individual trade union members <e> <s> why should that be so <e> <s> it is so because for a substantial period of time there have been growing doubts justified by evidence we have all read of abuses of a very disturbing character in terms of trade union elections <e>", "<cs> i would not wish to prolong this discussion but i wonder whether in terms of the future there can be some arrangement whereby these matters can be posted publicly in some way in the house so that we can all see this <e> <s> i do not share lord mottistones views on the matter and i think the use of the term dragooned is a rather extreme form of language to be blunt <e> <s> there must be a simple way to avoid arguments of this kind in the future and i hope we can do something along these lines to avoid this difficulty again <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong the discussion but i believe that all members of the committee have rights in this matter whether they have put amendments down or not <e> <s> i am sure the minister would agree with that <e> <s> the question is how we can improve our internal processes of communication <e> <s> i hope that this can be looked at in future <e> <s> i do not want to prolong the matter but i think there is general agreement that we should try to avoid this sort of problem in the future if we can <e>", "<cs> i rather agreed with the general approach of the noble lord lord lucas though i accept the force of some of the arguments deployed by the noble earl lord avon <e> <s> i think there is a real problem here touched on by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> of course we have to encourage responsible use of parking meter bays <e> <s> of course that is fight <e> <s> but i do not think that the department responsible for the implementation of this legislation should have any doubt about the degree of anger that there will be among many law-abiding motorists when they find these immobilisation devices on their cars when they have at least put their car on a parking meter when there are many other people in the same area who have not troubled to put their cars on parking meters and when the only reason why they find themselves in that position is not for any deliberate desire on their part to ignore the regulations but because and this is obviously a feature of many peoples lives they have been inadvertently delayed <e> <s> i believe that there is likely to be a great deal of public indignation about this and i hope we are not going to be told that it is quite impossible to refine this process <e>", "<cs> yes but i hope the noble earl is going to respond to the general feeling expressed in the committee on this particular amendment <e> <s> i hope he is going to give some clear indication that he is prepared to look at this matter again <e> <s> having simply listened to this debate as he of course has it appears that a very significant number of members of this committee are concerned about the provisions of the bill as they appear on the face of it <e> <s> i therefore hope very much that he will give some indication that he is prepared to look at this matter extremely seriously with a view to moving in the general direction set out in the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lucas <e>", "<cs> i share the view expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the more we go into this matter the more apprehensive one becomes of what is being proposed <e> <s> i agree very strongly with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it is a point which i made earlier <e> <s> there is a real risk of a very significant <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that there are some aspects of the answer which he has given today which fill a number of us with a great deal of concern particularly the suggestion that if the money is not used for regional secure units it will be used for other psychiatric purposes <e> <s> is he aware that his department has an unenviable record of diverting money in this way not only during the lifetime of the present administration but during the lifetime of previous administrations <e> <s> finally is he aware that until we make major progress in the development of regional secure units of this kind we shall not be able to get severely mentally disturbed people out of our prison system and therefore we shall continue with the scandalous situation of the mentally ill being kept in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that seems to be an extremely well-taken point <e> <s> the minister can only have it in one of two ways <e> <s> if as i understand the argument to run this will impose an intolerable strain on the prison service then by implication the number of children in this category is going to be substantial <e> <s> if on the other hand the numbers are going to be limited as i assume is the position the strain on the prison officers and the prison department establishments will be fairly small <e> <s> i do not with great respect think that the minister has made an altogether persuasive argument <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the minister that is not at all a satisfactory answer to my noble friend lord hunt <e> <s> prisoners will continue to be locked up hours out of whether or not this amendment is passed <e> <s> that is the fact as i am sure the noble lord lord elton will be the first to agree <e> <s> the difference that would be made in terms of lessening the pressures on prison officers has i think been considerably overstated by the noble lord <e> <s> i certainly recognise the problems of management which the noble lord lord elton put earlier <e> <s> he certainly has a case there <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect with the leave of the house perhaps i could answer that point <e> <s> i have indeed visited a number of such establishments in the recent past <e> <s> the conditions to which i referred reflect the general situation prevailing in local prisons and some of the problems attendant on this situation of over-crowding in fact put the position of the prison service in a great deal of difficulty because it then has to deal with the problem of looking after teenage prisoners of this kind <e> <s> it is that to which i refer <e>", "<cs> i welcome that my lords <e> <s> for some time it has been regarded as rather unfashionable to have senior attendance centres but speaking for myself i thought the decision of the government is this respect was very sensible <e> <s> i has an opportunity of visiting one of the two centres which existed before the present government came into office <e> <s> the centre was in greenwich and was run by officers of the traffic branch of the metropolitan police <e> <s> i thought that it was run with a high degree of efficiency and what is more having visited it i had no doubt that the kind of young men who were sent there would otherwise in many cases have attracted custodial sentences <e> <s> i was agreeably surprised at <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i think on one issue we are all agreed that is that we want to do everything we possibly can to avoid children or adults being sentenced to a period of custody <e> <s> therefore it is perfectly reasonable to look at what the government have come forward with to see whether this is a workable proposition <e> <s> it turns exclusively on the issue of enforceability and initially i certainly did not approach this issue as a dedicated opponent to the idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a state of some puzzlement if the noble lord lord trefgarne will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> he is such an agreeable member of your lordships house that it is quite impossible ever to become cross with him but if he were not so agreeable one might be mildly tempted to be a little cross <e> <s> he having delivered that speech which i think he would agree was remarkably reminiscent of a speech which he made at committee stage i fail to understand why the government said that they would consider the matter between committee and report because the argument which the noble lord has addressed to the house is an argument against the principle of this amendment <e> <s> that being so i am in something of a difficulty of wanting to apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me to be a very substantial sum <e> <s> it may well be that the matter has been carefully thought through by the noble lords department but could we be told how the figure of million is reached <e> <s> would the noble lord be helpful to the house and tell it precisely what are the constituent elements which go towards making up this total <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for pressing the noble lord but he will realise that the whole basis of his argument rests upon his statement that this will cost million <e> <s> it seems to me that if that figure is correct it is not at all unreasonable for us to ask the noble lord how it is made up <e> <s> bluntly it does not seem to me and i suspect it does not seem to others that that figure can deal with the question of magistrates expenses <e> <s> magistrates expenses are not quite on the scale which the noble lord seems to suggest <e>", "<cs> with great respect my lords this is a most important issue and that does not deal with the issue at all <e> <s> the issue which has been raised on the floor of the house is the accuracy of the figures <e> <s> all we are asking for is a letter to those of us who have spoken in the debate so that we may consider the matter before the third reading of the bill to see whether we should come back to the matter and table further amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would not agree that this is the second attack on british servicemen in london within a relatively short space of time and that this demonstrates the need for the various measures which have been taken by the present and previous governments to deal with the situation particularly the prevention of terrorism act <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he would agree that although we have all i think been seriously concerned about developments in the last few days this demonstrates the real peril so far as the people of this country are concerned and indeed the need to support the police in the measures that they are taking to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us will agree with the sentiments he has just expressed and that one of the least attractive features of this whole situation has been the relentless search for scapegoats <e> <s> if i may say so speaking as someone who is not a member of the same political party as the home secretary i deplore the very venomous and in my opinion unjustified personal attacks which have been made on the right honourable gentleman <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that many of us welcome the proposal to have a new permanent group headed by a senior official of the home office who is going to bring together as i understand it all the various interests involved in guaranteeing the security of the queen and other members of the royal family including the police and officers of the household division and of the property services agency <e> <s> this seems to me an extremely sensible proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for meeting the point in this amendment and with the leave of the house i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the conference of chief probation officers is taking place at this moment i should be interested to know exactly to whom he is attributing these views <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord says the probation service i am asking him specifically what is the view of the conference of the chief probation officers <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk said something wholly different on that point and the noble lord is appearing to contradict her and then when challenged he is saying that he is not prepared to specify to whom he is referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord he will of course appreciate what he said he referred to the probation service implying a unanimity of view <e> <s> he has now indicated that it is one part of the probation service that he was referring to <e> <s> it is a point of substance as i think he may agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be right to pretend that this decision was in any way an easy one for the government to take <e> <s> i say that at the outset <e> <s> in the middle of last year i was consulted by home office officials at the request of the home secretary on his own proposals <e> <s> on that occasion i ventured to give a number of opinions <e> <s> i was only giving a personal reaction at that time and the first important point i put forward was that i hoped this was not going to be called parole because it was not <e> <s> it was in fact an early release system there was no qualitative judgment on the individual cases coming before anything approaching an institution like the parole board itself <e> <s> it was in fact an early release scheme and there was a principle of automaticity <e> <s> there are problems about automaticity and about imposing a form of supervision on people who do not want to be supervised <e> <s> i accept that at once <e> <s> though i do not object to the governments changing their minds the warm agreement being expressed by the noble lord lord elton on this point disguises the fact that it was his government who were putting forward the proposal in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has just made the point that the government have changed their mind and asked should they be censured for that <e> <s> no of course they should not <e> <s> but i think that a number of us are concerned about the character of the new decision <e> <s> i do not believe there is any serious comparison at all between the partially-suspended sentence and what is proposed in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> when the noble lord mentions reservations of course there are reservations among many institutions which have been consulted <e> <s> the question however is whether they opposed the governments proposal in principle or whether they did not <e> <s> we all have reservations on virtually every possible scheme we have been considering <e> <s> there are painful and difficult choices in this matter <e> <s> i believe the government have taken the wrong decision and that if this amendment is not carried and not added to the bill we shall be driven into the executive release scheme which i believe will be a profound error and will cause widespread public anxiety and further trouble in the prisons <e>", "<cs> i rise simply to point out that the party represented on this bench propose to adopt a most reasonable approach to this question after the next general election so the noble earl need have no fears <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many fair-minded people believe that the nurses are not being treated generously <e> <s> but notwithstanding that is he aware that the action being taken by some pickets to impede the flow of the mail into hospitals is causing great concern in the medical profession <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that in the terms of the post office act it is an offence to impede the free flow of the mail and if that is indeed so what action is his department taking with the general administration of the national health service to draw this matter to the attention of the appropriate authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue raised in the amendment of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway the noble lord lord spens and myself is whether or not individual trade unionists should in reality be compelled to support financially a political party they do not favour <e> <s> that is the issue we are discussing at the moment and it is fundamental <e> <s> the legal background has been stated by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in the clearest terms <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill said under section of the trade union act as amended unions that want to contribute to a political party must establish a separate political fund and they must do that after a ballot of their members <e> <s> they are obliged to give all their members the right to contract out from paying this political levy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a question <e> <s> do they not also raise questions of personal freedom <e> <s> as i understood it is that not an issue which the noble earl and his colleagues take rather seriously <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have misheard the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that there will be no absolute enforceable requirement on the local authorities to make that information available <e> <s> is that what i understood the noble lord to say <e> <s> would he please clarify that <e>", "<cs> lords may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall gladly give way to the noble lord to allow him to resume his seat <e> <s> with great respect the answer that he has given is totally unintelligible <e> <s> having listened to the answer that he has just given to me it is wholly unclear what is the parents duty so far as the supervision is concerned <e> <s> is the duty none whatever under any circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support what my noble friend lord wigoder has just said <e> <s> private members both in this house and in another place often come forward with sensible ideas and sometimes they come forward with less than sensible ideas <e> <s> i think one is bound to acknowledge in the light of the response that there has been to the inquiries made by the home office that this is one of the less attractive ideas that has been put before parliament during the discussion on this particular bill <e> <s> rather like my noble friend lord wigoder i began as something of an agnostic on this question <e> <s> i cannot pretend that i had a very strong view on the matter when we began to discuss this but the more one looked into it the more one was persuaded that at the very best this idea required a great deal of work done within some areas on an experimental basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having accepted the amendment which the noble baroness lady trumpington and i put forward during the report stage of the bill obviously i agree with the noble lord that it is important for parliament to indicate the grave view it takes of trafficking in class a drugs particularly in heroin and cocaine although i accept the argument which he has put forward indicating that there would be administrative problems over differentiating this particular category of offender from others <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak only very briefly <e> <s> using fairly restrained language i find the ministers reply deeply disappointing <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones referred to ministers in the previous government <e> <s> i certainly was one and i made many speeches from that box in debates of this character defending the then governments record <e> <s> but i am bound to say that i find it almost impossible to envisage a situation where we would be having a debate with a prison population having touched and listening to that sort of speech from the government front bench <e> <s> as a minister i did not believe and i do not believe now that it is right to make this a party question <e> <s> it is a matter of supreme importance to our society that we should try to have the maximum degree of bipartisanship in dealing with our criminal justice system <e> <s> it is not the sort of issue that we should relegate to the small change of party political warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally trivial point and the minister really should not embark on that sort of argument <e> <s> i was addressing my remarks to the position last year as i made quite clear <e> <s> i have made my position clear <e> <s> i think the house now wishes to come to a decision on the matter and i therefore propose to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is common ground that we are deeply indebted to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having <e>", "<cs> my lords youth unemployment in this country is a very serious matter but i do not believe that figures of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate suggested today is a situation which grave though the existing situation is applies to young whites in many parts of this country <e> <s> i would find it astonishing were that to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is apparently moving off the subject of police training may i remind him that i specifically asked whether the government were or were not going to accept the recommendation of the noble and learned lord that the minimum period for initial training should be six months <e> <s> is the answer yes or no <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many of us recognise the force of the argument that she has just put forward that if procedures were tightened up beyond a reasonable extent it could create genuine civil liberties problems <e> <s> i think most of us accept the force of that argument but would she also not agree that the revelations at this trial have done the most grievous damage to our relations with the united states of america and with the intelligence community within the united states which will have a very serious impact upon our security services in this country <e> <s> secondly would she recognise that this matter came to light only because of a particularly painstaking inquiry undertaken by police officers in the west mercia force into a number of sexual offences <e> <s> had it not been for that inquiry the offences of mr prime would not have been detected <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is common ground on the basis of the speeches which have been made so far that the issue we are debating this evening is a matter of great importance in our system of criminal justice in this country <e> <s> for that reason if for no other we are much indebted to my noble friend lord wigoder for having introduced this bill today although at this stage i would enter one caveat and i suspect that my noble friend would agree with me <e> <s> i very much regret that we are not discussing a government bill to deal with this matter which was indeed the point made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> frankly i do not believe that in normal circumstances it is appropriate for private <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall gladly deal with that point <e> <s> no they did not serve on juries <e> <s> i fear that i may not have put this as clearly as i should have done <e> <s> the point i am making is that all of them were defendants at the old bailey and all of them were qualified for jury service notwithstanding the long records of previous criminal convictions <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to my noble friend there have been cases where juries did take the money which they had been given and took it into police stations in the metropolitan police district <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> he has dealt very adequately with the various points raised in the debate <e> <s> he may be about to come to this particular point and if so i apologise <e> <s> the noble lord has indicated the governments general approach to this issue <e> <s> is he going to indicate whether the government propose to introduce legislation in this session of parliament to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us welcome what he has just said in the latter part of his answer and that we like him look forward to welcoming a democratic spain into the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is common ground that the issues raised in the bill which we are debating this evening are not new <e> <s> they lay at the heart of the argument that took place during the passage of the abortion act and they were subsequently raised in the seven unsuccessful attempts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate and let me just put the matter to him <e> <s> with great respect i wish it were as simple as that but i believe that the passage of this bill would give rise to a climate of uncertainty within the medical profession <e> <s> it is not quite so easy as the right reverend prelate imagines to give a reassuring answer of the kind for which he obviously hopes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise for interrupting the noble earl so early and this is not in fact addressed to him i am really addressing his noble friend through him <e> <s> a number of us are waiting to hear the important statement to be made by the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> we have already had to cancel a number of appointments this afternoon <e> <s> it would be helpful if at the end of this debate we had a clear indication as to when we are going to have the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a question relating to the question put to him a moment ago by the noble lord lord hampton <e> <s> i think many of us increasingly recognise the need for self-publicity of the present leader of the greater london council but does the noble earl not agree that in the light of the outrage perpetrated in ballykelly last night it would be something approaching a national scandal if this visit to london of a group of terrorists and the public relations officers of terrorists took place <e> <s> can i ask him whether he would not agree that nothing except perhaps a further intervention of the leader of the opposition in another place can possibly stop this disgraceful episode from taking place <e> <s> can i ask also whether the noble earl would not recognise that there are real risks as far as public order in london is concerned when this visit occurs <e> <s> lastly may i put this to him <e> <s> he will be aware as i am of the provisions of the prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act as it is quite clear that a number of the people who are going to embark on this journey are clearly covered by the provisions of this act would it not be desirable to make it quite clear that this act will be implemented if they arrive in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether it means that if in fact the council of ministers does not reach <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what has changed since his honourable and right honourable friends in another place tried to amend the act relating to the european assembly when they advocated precisely the change that i am suggesting in this question <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware of a sense of burning injustice felt by many hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens who are not getting the vote in these elections <e> <s> could not the noble lord at least ask his right honourable friend the home secretary to pass on the views of these people <e> <s> as i have indicated they do not understand why when in many cases they are doing urgent work promoting british trade they do not get the vote in these elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to enable certain local government elections in england and wales to be held by that system which entitles each elector to a single transferable vote <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although many of us take the view that it may well be right to question the judgment of the government in this matter and one can understand some of the anxieties which have been and will be expressed in scotland on this question we share his view and the view of my noble friend lord tordoff that there is something rather squalid in some of the personal attacks which have been made on the secretary of state in the past hours <e> <s> although many of us may differ from the noble lord on matters of policy no one could conceivably question his honour <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> he very kindly invited me to ask one earlier <e> <s> he is speaking for the official opposition in this house <e> <s> can he simply answer this question is he in favour of black-listing contractors on the grounds that they have secured government contracts or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to associate myself with the various tributes that have been paid to my noble friend lord donaldson for having raised this matter tonight and to associate myself with the general thrust of what he said and with what virtually everybody has said particularly the noble lord lord hooson <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure that all of us welcome the fact that he is to pay this visit to grendon <e> <s> it will i am sure be a great pleasure to the staff and to the board of visitors <e> <s> may i however ask the noble lord a question which i put to him earlier <e> <s> he dealt at some length with the question of overcrowding and rightly so <e> <s> i asked the noble lord whether because of the present degree of overcrowding the government were going to implement that section of the criminal justice act which would bring down the parole threshold and thereby provide some relief for the present degree of overcrowding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> many of your lordships who favour the bill start on the basis that they would support the introduction of proportional representation for elections in another place but that is certainly not the position of everybody who backs the bill <e> <s> that is not surprising because although the case for the introduction of pr in another place may be regarded by many as strong the case for introducing it into local government elections is i believe overwhelming <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express considerable gratitude to all who have spoken in the debate on both sides of the argument and i think that we all immensely enjoyed the speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton made one very accurate point <e> <s> he said that i had torn up part of my speech <e> <s> i had indeed <e> <s> i had intended to say and fortunately the character of his speech enabled me not to make this point that the home office officials should not be blamed for the sort of speech he made <e> <s> of course home office officials have this unhappy task whatever the government may be <e> <s> they produce exactly the same speech because both front benches agree entirely on this matter as has been made clear during this debate <e> <s> the noble lords speech was clearly his own work and it was none the worse for that <e> <s> however i would express one word of gratitude to him <e> <s> he did not think it right to advise the house which way to vote on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that both the ministers statement in another place and his own statement today appear to a number of us to be almost incomprehensible <e> <s> is he aware following the question put to him by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that the noble lord was simply referring to the position of the chairman of the beddington cab which was itself part of the ministers statement in another place justifying the wholly mistaken decision which he has now taken <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that he owes to the house an explanation as to whether the facts stated by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede are correct or incorrect <e> <s> if i may put a further point to the noble lord is he aware that the ministers statement repeated here vague allegations about changing attitudes within the cabs will be seen by many to be a slur upon an wholly admirable organisation <e> <s> finally is the noble lord aware that a six-month grant is wholly unacceptable to a major organisation like the national association of citizens advice bureaux which requires sustained financial support if it is to do worthwhile work in the community <e>", "<cs> if i may say a few words following the noble baroness lady birk i always look forward to those occasions when the noble baroness lady trumpington and i are allies <e> <s> but i am bound to say that on this occasion i am in an extremely difficult position because i wholly disagree with virtually everything she said in the short speech she made <e> <s> with great respect to her because i know that she is a person of considerable liberal sentiment i do not think she wholly understood the point that she was making because what she was saying to us was that because mr livingstone and his colleagues produce a journal which periodically says unattractive things as undoubtedly it does therefore the language of this statute should be framed in a different way <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question of the noble lord at this point <e> <s> is the house able to pray against them <e> <s> is it the negative procedure <e>", "<cs> may i put in one point <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord skelmersdale is right in saying that there is not an enormous amount between us on this question <e> <s> but with great respect i do not think that he has wholly satisfied the committee and i hope that before report stage and certainly well before third reading there can be some discussion of the kind he has suggested because i do not believe that a document in the vote office meets the point of those who have spoken during this debate <e> <s> i just do not think that that is at all satisfactory <e> <s> if it is in the vote office all that can be done is to put a question on the order paper or presumably an unstarred question <e> <s> we want something far more satisfactory than that <e> <s> the noble lord has offered to look again at this matter and i very much hope that he will discuss it with his advisers because at the moment i do not think his proposal wholly meets the point that has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord is going to look at it with more than care <e> <s> the statements i have quoted are direct quotations from the noble lord <e> <s> he was the person who put the cost at to per night <e> <s> after he has looked at this tomorrow carefully as i am sure he will i hope he will come to the conclusion that if there is any doubt at all about these figures particularly given the scale of error which it is at least possible to interpret from these different answers he has given he should use the normal procedures of the house and make a personal statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has answered albeit rather briefly the point on the parole threshold and he rightly said he had gone into much detail and had taken a lot of trouble to answer the various points that have been made <e> <s> will he not give any indication of when the government will make up their mind on the parole threshold <e> <s> is it really impossible to give any guidance at all about when that will be done <e> <s> i hope the noble lord intends to look into the question of the inaccuracy of the statements he made last year <e> <s> i do not want to make a major issue of it but bluntly if ministers make inaccurate statements they should correct them <e>", "<cs> because the noble lord had not corrected it in the past i was giving him an opportunity to consider doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> would he not agree that what is represented in the action of southwark and other local authorities is an abuse of power on a truly deplorable level <e> <s> first in the debate that we had on this matter in january the noble lord lord bellwin indicated that there was going to be a reference to the office of fair trading <e> <s> has that taken place and if so with what result <e> <s> secondly would the noble lord not agree that the government have a duty to protect their own contractors and what is even more important the employees of those contractors from arbitrary action by local authorities on the lines advocated now by the campaign for nuclear disarmament <e> <s> finally does he not agree that there is a need to protect the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has indicated this morning the anxieties of the government as regards this matter <e> <s> first is he going to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all join in thanking the noble earl lord longford for the opportunity that he has given us today to discuss the work of the probation service <e> <s> i participate in the debate with particular pleasure because for five years <e> <s> i had ministerial responsibility for the service and for a further three years as chairman of the parole board i had the opportunity of seeing the work of the service as did my noble friend lord hunt before me <e> <s> i think that both of us and indeed all our colleagues on the parole board would join in an expression of appreciation of the very high quality of work that we experienced from members of the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that he will look into this point with his right honourable friend and i hope with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the home office should ask the lord chancellor for money to carry out their responsibilities <e> <s> i was suggesting the lord chancellor department made a contribution to the vote so far as this aspect is concerned because the probation service is fulfilling his departments responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall respond only briefly before withdrawing the motion for papers standing in my name <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton need have no anxiety that he is likely to experience any reproach from me resulting from his speech <e> <s> i am glad to say that with one significant exception i agree with almost everything the noble lord said <e> <s> i suspect that this is also the view of very nearly all those who have participated in what i believe has been a very interesting and rewarding debate <e> <s> like the noble lord lord elton i hope that not only editors but as the noble lord lord jacobson said proprietors pay some attention to what has been said in this debate really on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> i do not doubt and i am sure many who are apprehensive about the situation disclosed by my noble friend will not doubt that the minister and his colleagues are seriously concerned about what has been happening in a number of london boroughs and elsewhere where the activities of the extreme left which has taken control of those local authorities have done grave damage to the reputation of english local government <e> <s> i do not doubt and i am sure nobody else does the noble lords general condemnation of such behaviour <e> <s> but the question he has to answer is a rather different one what is he going to do about it <e>", "<cs> it was a most remarkable statement that the noble lord has just made <e> <s> the bill arrived in this house only on monday for second reading <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that he will oppose any amendment to this bill at any stage before he has read the terms of an amendment <e> <s> is that what he is saying <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord then explain what he did intend <e> <s> if i have inadvertently misrepresented him i will of course gladly withdraw but as i understood it he was wanting to indicate to us indeed he did indicate to us that it was so vital to get the bill on the statute book quickly as fast as possible <e> <s> urgent work remained to be done <e> <s> it was at the very least a quite clear implication that if he was not going to take objection in principle to any amendment put down he would approach it in an extremely negative spirit <e> <s> if i have got him wrong i will gladly withdraw <e>", "<cs> i shall now come to the terms of the amendment because we will be coming back to this on report stage i should not leave the noble lord in any doubt on that matter and we will be coming back to it on third reading as well in the form of amendments <e> <s> what we have to say to him is that of course the labour party agrees with him on this matter because we are discussing the behaviour of a left-wing local authority <e> <s> so it is hardly surprising that when he looks for comfort from the labour benches he gets it <e> <s> of course he does <e> <s> what we are concerned <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord lord mishcon has said but i shall look with interest tomorrow at the <e>", "<cs> i was about to remind the noble lord lord bellwin of that point <e> <s> i can understand the speech of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and i congratulate him upon the degree of indignation that he managed to get into his speech <e> <s> i wish that a little part of that indignation had been directed at the anti-democratic behaviour of his political colleagues in islington but as we noted it was not <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> what i had hoped that the noble lord would join me in doing was to condemn the examples i have given of what the labour councillors at islington have been doing <e> <s> of course the noble lords position on the general abuse of power is well known <e> <s> i have been indicating like my noble friend lord kilmarnock the disgraceful behaviour of the labour party in the london borough of islington <e> <s> further examples of this have been given <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord bellwin has indicated his concern not only this afternoon but on the last occasion that we had the opportunity to discuss the matter <e> <s> at that time we were discussing what the labour party was going in southwark <e> <s> it was behaviour defended on that occasion by the opposition spokesman in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying briefly to this interesting debate i should first like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for two things first for having received us at such short notice and for having had with my noble friend lord kilmarnock and myself such a helpful discussion yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing my own gratitude and i am sure that of many other members of your lordships house to the most reverend primate for having introduced the debate today <e> <s> in my view it has been regrettable that this house has not had the opportunity of discussing the question of capital punishment either in this parliament or in the last parliament when

past provided any answer to this problem <e> <s> accordingly what action is he contemplating taking to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that in the police service in particular among senior officers there is widespread concern about the existing state of the law <e> <s> with great respect she has not answered the noble and learned lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two points arising from the statement <e> <s> first would he confirm notwithstanding what the noble lord lord dean of beswick said that the and acts in no way changed the law so far as illegal picketing was concerned that in fact it has always been unlawful to do what was done in warrington last week and what it is suggested is going to take place in warrington this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on these benches wish to say in the most unqualified terms unlike the statement that has just been made by the leader of the opposition that we warmly approve of the action of the police last night and we wish the chief constable of cheshire to be told on our behalf and <e> <s> i am sure on behalf of the overwhelming majority of the house of our warm support for the bravery and courage of many of the police officers concerned who were so viciously abused last night <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will be good enough to give way <e>", "<cs> that is the only point that i am going to ask the noble lord about <e> <s> is he aware that what i said was that i went there at the request of the then home secretary who was deeply alarmed about what was going on in the grunwick picket line and wished to be reassured that all possible steps were being taken by the government to support the metropolitan police <e> <s> what i saw then persuaded me that some change in the law was necessary because of the very serious situations which were arising there and of course there was clearly no adequate framework of law <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble earl lord longford for having initiated this evening this debate which raises issues of considerable public importance <e> <s> quite apart from anything else it provides an opportunity for the noble lord lord henniker to make his maiden speech <e> <s> before he does so i should say that i do not think there is a more appropriate matter on which he could speak as he was a most valued colleague of mine on the parole board for some years <e> <s> we look forward very much to hearing what he will have to say later <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to hearing the noble lord lord elton reply on behalf of the home office <e> <s> i am sure that he will do it far more adequately than i but my recollection is that statisticians are quite unable to work out any prediction scores so far as women prisoners are concerned <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question on that <e> <s> the then vice-chairman the high court judge did not recommend the abolition of the joint committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i was endeavouring to make on the last occasion and today is this and this is the point should like to put to the noble lord <e> <s> does not what he is now saying make it absolutely clear how unwise it is to fix rigid categories of different types of murderer <e> <s> there are so many exceptions and there are other equally compelling cases i can put to him that it brings considerable doubt on to whether a new approach has a great deal of sense to commend it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that those of us on these benches wish to be associated with the words of the home secretary in another place expressing his horror at the scale of this atrocity committed outside harrods on saturday <e> <s> is he also aware first that it appears from the statement made from dublin by the ira that they claim that there are representatives active in the united kingdom supplied with explosives provided by the ira who are wholly outside the control of the ira leadership in dublin <e> <s> is he further aware that no one would take protestations of this kind in any degree seriously <e>", "<cs> i follow the point that has been made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i hope that the government will reflect on this matter between now and report stage <e> <s> it is the general view of many in the committee that this is a worthwhile bill and we want to see some progress made on it <e> <s> we all know perfectly well if i may say so having occupied a job not dissimilar to that held by the noble lord lord elton that when one hears words like full and detailed consultation or words to that effect in many cases it means a great deal of inactivity for a very substantial period of time <e>", "<cs> i am not going to delay the committee but i should like to register the point that i am not clear what the effect of this amendment would in reality be <e> <s> if one is going to create some form of defence of this kind i am not sure how the term reasonable precautions would be interpreted in the courts <e> <s> i make the point today but i may conceivably want to come back to this on report because if this bill is as i hope going to proceed further we must be clear that it is undesirable to put in forms of words of this kind which could drive a coach and horses through the meaning of this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl one or two questions arising from the statement <e> <s> first would he accept that many of us agree with him that given the fact that grave errors have been committed it is entirely right that a number of staff changes have taken place <e> <s> secondly although it is perfectly understandable that the noble lord lord underhill raised the question of whether there would possibly be a deterioration in relation to remand prisoners given the fact that five guns were smuggled into the maze is it not absolutely clear that there will have to be infinitely more vigorous arrangements made for families visiting that prison <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord campbell of alloway replies may i say that i hope he will not be put off unduly by the ministers fairly predictable response to his amendment <e> <s> the ministers case is and i speak as someone who has a high regard for those who work in whitehall and around it that the gentlemen in whitehall know best <e> <s> he is defending a situation whereby the authority will be given an absolute discretion <e> <s> without in any sense supporting every particular subsection of what the noble lord lord campbell of alloway is putting forward i believe that we need to look at this matter far more seriously i hope we shall have an opportunity to do so at report stage <e>", "<cs> i realise the amendment we are discussing which is the one that has just been put to the house but what other amendments are we taking at the same time <e> <s> i am not wholly clear what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> as i indicated earlier i do not propose to detain the committee at considerable length i realise that it is the general wish of the committee to make as much progress as possible <e> <s> but i look forward at some stage to debating this matter at rather greater length with the noble lord who has just resumed his seat <e> <s> he and i are allies on most issues though not unhappily on this <e> <s> i repeat to him that if we do not move in the direction in which this amendment endeavours to move towards incorporating in the bill our treaty obligations so far as the european convention on human rights is concerned this country will continue to have the worst record in europe of being dragged to strasbourg in one civil rights case after another <e> <s> that as we all know is the reality of it <e> <s> having made that point the hour is late and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we may well return to it however at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> there are some important issues here relating to broadcasting freedom not only to the cable authority but the bbc and the iba <e> <s> we are conferring extraordinary powers for which so far as i am aware there is very little precedent <e> <s> in clause we are giving a superintendent of police the power to <e>", "<cs> i asked the noble lord about the association of chief police officers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is widespread indignation in the prison service both among governors and among members of the prison officers association that neither of their professional organisations was consulted before the right honourable gentleman made his speech at the conservative party conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it hard to believe that some of the most loyal supporters of the party oppposite can doubt that the government have seriously mishandled this issue of the gchq <e> <s> on one issue i think there is general agreement that is that crucially important issues of national security are involved <e> <s> no one has seriously challenged that proposition <e> <s> i should make it clear if that is at all necessary that my noble friends and i do not regard it as acceptable that trade unions should be allowed to call strikes or organise disruption at an intelligence monitoring agency which is of vital importance to the security of this country to the united states and to the whole of the north atlantic alliance <e> <s> in these circumstances i believe that the government indeed any government would deserve support when they said that such conduct would not be accepted <e> <s> i think that that would be the view of the overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question on that point <e> <s> why did his right honourable friend not make that clear on th january <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about the statement which was made on th january <e> <s> why was the latter point the one which the noble lord has just mentioned not made absolutely clear in the statement made in both houses <e>", "<cs> on one matter i think that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would have persuaded us that he was right and that was that telephone tapping is desirable on some occasions in the national interest <e> <s> first it is clearly desirable when there is a case of espionage or suspected espionage <e> <s> secondly it is desirable when there is a belief that it is the only way of bringing to justice some group of criminals involved in the international trade in narcotics <e> <s> thirdly it is right when there is a belief by the home secretary that it is the only way to bring to justice people who are involved in grave criminal offences which if carried through will cause loss of life <e>", "<cs> at the beginning of a relatively brief speech this afternoon may i say that it gives me pleasure to follow the noble lord lord fitt and to say that all of us including those who do not agree with the conclusion which he has just expressed on this amendment pay tribute to him for the high courage he has displayed in standing up against ira terrorism in northern ireland <e> <s> on an such occasion as this it is right to recognise that fact <e> <s> when i was a minister in the home office i remember having a discussion with the noble lord about one of the exclusion order cases about which he has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will begin by making an apology to the noble lord and to the house that i have to slip away soon and i would not wish the noble lord to believe that i had been discourteous to him by so doing <e> <s> i should like to speak briefly and say that i strongly agree with the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> it is a significant improvement if i may say so on the amendment we discussed at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> i mentioned mr hatton and his colleagues yes <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than indulge in question and answer now i should be glad to hear what the noble lord says on that particular point <e> <s> but it seems quite clear to me that mr hatton does have an overwhelming majority of support in the labour group in liverpool <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to persist in this cross-examination <e> <s> the noble lord has not troubled to put his name down to speak <e> <s> the fact is that i have made my position quite clear on what mr hatton stands for and the degree of support he has in the labour group in liverpool <e> <s> i do not think that it is appropriate to say any more <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put the noble baroness right <e> <s> the form of the question has in no way changed since i first put it down <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord implies that a number of authorities are not making progress <e> <s> is that so <e> <s> if it is which are those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be absolutely clear which amendment we are discussing <e> <s> is it amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and i endeavoured to persuade the house and we very nearly succeeded on the cable and broadcasting bill to include a similar provision <e> <s> i am warmly in favour of local authorities and others being made to give reasoned decisions so that there is always the fall-back possibility of a judicial review <e> <s> i am sure that this is the right way to deal with it <e> <s> therefore i very much welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> would he not agree with me that one of the disturbing elements of this situation is that the archway road episode is by no means an isolated instance <e> <s> that being so does he feel that at some stage in the future when the law on the matter is being reviewed it would be appropriate to see whether any possible clarification of the law is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is widespread agreement in the house this afternoon as is obvious from the question raised by the noble lord lord fanshawe and what was said by the noble earl lord cathcart a few moments ago <e> <s> that being so could she tell us when this matter was last put by the british government to the soviet ambassador in london or to the soviet government in moscow and when this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply and placing on one side matters that are now properly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put forward one additional point or rather ask one further question in the light of the noble lords answer <e> <s> would he not agree that libya has been involved over the last few years in a whole series of attacks on libyan nationals in this country <e> <s> would he not agree that in this situation it is necessary to indicate to the libyan government that if this continues we shall have to ask some of the representatives of the libyan peoples bureau in london to leave these shores <e>", "<cs> my lords when is it hoped that that relay station might be in use assuming that the negotiations with the seychelles government go satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all associate my noble friends with the tributes which have been paid to woman police officer fletcher and express to her relatives our deep regret at her untimely death <e> <s> at the same time i should like to associate my noble friends with what the noble lord lord mishcon has said about those who were shot down in the street at the same time and who are now we hope recovering in hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord cockfield aware of the deep anxiety that i am sure is shared in all parts of the house about what is going on in relation to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words before the noble lord lord mishcon responds <e> <s> i should like to urge him to follow the advice of the noble lord lord nugent and withdraw this amendment without any prejudice to his position at report stage <e>", "<cs> i say right at the outset and the minister may be about to say this for all i know that this is not a new issue <e> <s> local authorities have felt for a long time that when issues of this sort arise in their areas and the chief constable decides that he must bring in a substantial number of policemen from other forces that it is quite unreasonable that that local authority should have to pick up the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord elton for repeating the statement here i should like to put two questions to him arising from it <e> <s> first is he aware that we on these benches warmly welcome the home secretarys statement that he is to strengthen immigration checks on libyan visitors to this country <e> <s> we welcome his statement that libyan students who come to britain must be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question on the last point made by the noble baroness concerning the scanning of diplomatic bags <e> <s> does she not agree in the light of the explosives which were in the libyan peoples bureau that it is almost certain that diplomatic bags were used to introduce ammunition and guns into the united kingdom <e> <s> that being so does not the noble baroness agree that we shall obviously have to review this matter <e> <s> in the light of the general situation she has described can she provide some indication of the countries which do scan diplomatic bags <e> <s> i believe it will be helpful to the house to have that information <e> <s> as i understand it those countries are able to scan the content of diplomatic bags notwithstanding the requirements of the vienna convention <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to say that unlike the noble lord lord mishcon i support this bill almost without reservation <e> <s> my single reservation relates to the point which the noble lord lord mishcon made towards the end of his speech when he dealt with probation orders <e> <s> at this stage i am not saying that i am necessarily opposed to the provision in the bill but it is only fair to say that many people in the probation service are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord had a meeting <e> <s> as far as i can recall we had no such agreement <e> <s> we had a useful meeting with the solicitor-general but as far as i can recall there was no obligation on either side that there should be confidentiality <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been commonly accepted that the matter we are discussing today has deeply shocked public opinion in this country and in many other countries as well <e> <s> that is the circumstances in which a young policewoman was shot down in st jamess square and shortly thereafter we were compelled to escort the murderers to london airport and see them safely on to a plane to take them back to libya <e>", "<cs> my lords without becoming involved in an argument about the falklands inquiry what is the argument against this matter going to the security commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with something of an apology because this is the second time that i have spoken in the past hour on rather different matters <e> <s> but i should like to say how grateful we are to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for having raised this matter <e> <s> as he has indicated he has had a lifetimes interest in and concern for the probation service and it is of great help to the probation service that he has raised this matter tonight <e> <s> although i say that i do not agree in all respects with the criticisms he has made but in one or two respects we probably share a common outlook <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baronesss department are considering these matters which have been widely publicised in the press in the past few days will they then consider making any representations to the soviet authorities about this whole matter particularly in the light of the decision of the jury <e> <s> secondly may i ask her whether her department will in particular consider the allegations made at the inquest that the embassy in moscow did not take with sufficient seriousness the suggestions made that mr skinner was under severe pressure from the kgb <e> <s> lastly may i ask her whether she will ensure in so far as we can that the russian government is made absolutely aware of the fact that if anything is done to harm mrs skinner in this country in the way that mr markovs life was extinguished by the bulgarians not so long ago this will in itself do great damage to relations between this country and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up the supplementary question of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he asked whether there would be a statement after the foreign office had considered these matters in detail <e> <s> is that not a reasonable request <e> <s> can we not receive an assurance from the noble baroness that a statement will be made when that review has been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer a question on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be suggesting that anyone who is a critic of this bill is a critic only because he has been bamboozled by the glcs propaganda campaign <e> <s> will not the noble lord realise that that is a particularly unworthy suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it hard to believe particularly after listening to the debate today that there are many noble lords opposite who do not entertain some doubts about this extraordinary bill <e> <s> indeed i am sure that there are several ministers though undoubtedly they come from outside the department of the environment who profoundly wish that the government had never proceeded in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords could the chief whip help us <e> <s> two different questions appear to have been put <e> <s> the motion was moved by the noble lord lord denham and apparently a different issue was put to the house a few moments ago <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord denham can help us <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that we are grateful to him for having repeated this statement <e> <s> following <e>", "<cs> i understand the position of the opposition as far as this amendment is concerned <e> <s> i think that their position is entirely logical <e> <s> they are opposed to this bill in every aspect as they were opposed to the last trade union bill in every aspect and the one before that as well <e> <s> therefore their position if i may say so can be described as very clearly defined indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> would he agree with me that there is increasing public disquiet about the increasing traffic in cocaine and heroin in this country <e> <s> the very modest announcement he has made today compares extremely unfavourably with the reduction of customs and excise uniformed staff which has taken place since april <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a further question to the noble earl on that particular point <e> <s> may i ask him whether he would agree that in a situation where there has been a very substantial increase of illicit importation of cocaine and heroin it is right to reduce the uniformed staff of hm customs and excise at heathrow and elsewhere when we know perfectly well that many people going through the green channel have illicitly imported these dangerous drugs into this country and are now less likely to have their luggage inspected because of the reduction in staff that has been brought about during the lifetime of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware on the last point that he made that the parole board regularly sees cases of people who have been arrested at heathrow bringing drugs illicitly through the green channel <e> <s> is he aware in the context of the reply he has given today that it is disturbing that it is possible to pass through the green channel as easily as one can at the moment <e> <s> one reason is the reduction of the uniformed staff that has taken place since april <e>", "<cs> i am speaking primarily to amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord lord dean of beswick referred <e> <s> i would be hesitant for the reasons given by the noble and learned lord lord denning to support an amendment of this kind <e> <s> i have no doubt that the description of his own industrial experience as given by the noble lord lord dean of beswick is entirely accurate <e> <s> however i must draw his attention as i did when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> last week to what actually happened in the affairs of the electrical trade union in <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak for the first time on this bill <e> <s> that being so i will do my best not to make a second reading speech which i am sure members of the committee are relieved to hear <e> <s> i should declare an interest at the outset in that i am a trustee of the police foundation <e> <s> i do not propose to say that on every occasion as regards every amendment but i declare it now so that it is part of the record <e> <s> that being so it did not seem to me appropriate that i should speak in any way as a party spokesman during the committee stage of this bill and i speak therefore now as i shall for the rest of the bill entirely for myself <e>", "<cs> my i just ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> i think that it was indeed put to him by the noble lord lord plant <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> what are the powers of the customs and excise in this matter <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that this matter was put to him <e> <s> i should like to know what the answer is <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i did ask the noble lord a question about the customs and excise <e>", "<cs> before the minister leaves this point i hope the government will before the next stage of the bill look into the point made by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> that is that it seems to me very strange that the offence of arson is excluded from this provision <e> <s> on conviction of arson you can be sentenced to life imprisonment <e> <s> it seems to me rather strange that that being so it is not a serious offence <e>", "<cs> i do not want to persist with this point to a wearisome degree but i must say to the noble lord that i fear that the list has not been carefully thought through <e> <s> it makes absolutely no sense to include item to which the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has referred and to exclude the offence of arson <e> <s> let me put this point directly to the noble lord <e> <s> parliament has thought fit to make the maximum penalty for arson life imprisonment <e> <s> that is a fact <e> <s> it seems astonishing to me i would find it surprising if any of my former colleagues on the parole board take a contrary view in the light of the sort of offences that we regularly reviewed in terms of their degree of seriousness to exclude arson and to include <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be relieved to know that this is the last time that i shall intervene on this particular point <e> <s> i suspect the noble lord realises that the committee would be grateful for some assurance that the department will look at the whole of this schedule again between now and the report stage <e> <s> i rather agree with my noble friend lord hutchinson i understand paragraphs to inclusive <e> <s> after that quite frankly it does not make much sense <e> <s> i do not propose to rehearse the argument on arson i still find it odd <e> <s> if we go beyond paragraph that we do not include arson <e> <s> i find it strange that we include incest and leave out armed robbery <e>", "<cs> it may well be that the suggestion made by my noble friend lord wigoder that clause <e>", "<cs> i think that there are indeed practical arguments relating to this amendment as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones suggested in moving it <e> <s> but in fact they are practical arguments which are in the opposite direction to the one which the noble and learned lord favours <e> <s> following the point made by the noble and learned lord lord denning i want to deal with a particular problem which would arise if the rank was that of assistant chief constable <e> <s> there are police forces in england and wales which have only one assistant chief constable and a deputy chief constable and chief constable on their establishments all the other forces have more than one assistant <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say a few words as somebody who has not spoken before in this debate <e> <s> this is the first time that your lordships have discussed this issue <e> <s> the noble lord suggests that it has been discussed time and again it has not <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord with great respect that apart from himself every single person who has spoken has done so in favour of the amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances would he not agree to go no further than to say that he will report this matter to the home secretary and will consider it before the report stage of the bill <e> <s> that does not seem unreasonable and it is in accordance with the general traditions of this chamber <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the government chief whip does not seem to have a very long memory <e> <s> he will recall from his experience as <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak following two addresses one by the noble baroness opposite and the other by the noble lord lord houghton i have a high regard for both but unhappily this afternoon i agree with only one and that is the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> i am bound to say to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for whom i repeat i have a warm regard that i find the argument about whether the trade unions are graciously going to obey the law unacceptable in a democratic society <e> <s> as i understood it the suggestion that he made a few moments ago was that some delegation of members of the tuc general council had told the secretary of state that there was a risk that if the amendment which was carried during the committee stage was carried through on to the statute book there would be and i think that this was his phrase widespread default of the law <e> <s> the implication of that is that there is not widespread default of the law already <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pretend to be in quite the same state of ecstasy as the noble viscount about this bill <e> <s> nevertheless as my noble friend lord rochester has said we on these benches welcome the bill because it will provide greater democratic rights for trade unionists <e> <s> that is the objective of the bill and in so far as that general principle runs through the bill we welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very happy to give way to the noble earl after i have finished making this point <e> <s> if the noble earl is going to say that every nationalised industry is wholly free to go to the courts tomorrow so far as unlawful secondary picketing is concerned then i and i am sure others will very much welcome that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble earl says <e> <s> i am sure we shall all wait with interest to see what happens <e> <s> i hope very much that we shall not be placed in the position of writing into legislation provisions which once on the statute book are implemented only by private employers and not by nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> may i ask her whether she is aware of the serious anxiety there is on this matter in that people who are wanted by the police are apparently able to sun themselves in spain with impunity <e> <s> that being so is she also aware that many of us who look forward to full spanish membership of the european community hope that this urgent matter will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> if i may say so i was not altogether surprised by the fact that some private employers were using the law given the fact that i happen to be on the board of a company which has itself used the law <e> <s> i made it quite clear on the last occasion that the most disturbing aspect of this situation was the fact it has not been denied and it has not been denied by the noble earl this afternoon that the government have given instructions to nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i will listen with interest and with particular care to what the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl one question that was directly put to him by my noble friend lord rochester <e> <s> why have we not had a definitive government statement this week on this crucially important issue <e> <s> if it had not been for a last minute switch of questions on the order paper we would have had no opportunity to hear any government spokesman on this matter <e> <s> will the noble earl give an undertaking that we shall have a definitive statement on this matter next week on two aspects of the question first the general industrial situation in the coal mines and secondly the public order questions which arise night after night <e> <s> it really is not good enough just to see the secretary of state for energy on television <e> <s> we should have a statement in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on these benches would wish to be associated in every respect with the statement made by the home secretary in another place <e> <s> i do not want to add to that statement because my noble friend lady seear dealt with this matter at length last week and it would be pointless for me to go over the same ground except to say that this was a dastardly attack <e> <s> it was an attack on british democracy and it must be responded to in the most vigorous fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl give way for a moment <e> <s> those changes followed detailed inquiry <e> <s> does the noble earl not realise that what many object to on this occasion is the fact that there has been no such inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i warmly welcome the fact that this debate is taking place this afternoon <e> <s> we shall clearly spend an immense amount of time this session debating local government not only the governments proposals for the abolition of the greater london council and the substantial changes in the responsibilities in the metropolitan areas but also we shall have the opportunity of discussing i suspect on a number of occasions the consequences of the governments rate capping legislation <e> <s> that being so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this has been a notable debate and that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter must be gratified about its character <e> <s> it has had a number of special features not least that four senior former civil servants have spoken the noble lord lord moran a former senior member of the diplomatic service a former secretary to the cabinet a former permanent secretary at the home office and a former head of the civil service <e> <s> for those reasons alone it has been important <e> <s> while mentioning retired members of the public service i should perhaps add that there are few legislatures in the world that have the advantage of having among their members so many senior retired civil servants who take an active role in the day-to-day activities of the house <e> <s> we derive considerable benefit from their expertise and in saying that i must add the following point <e> <s> i very much regret that so far there has been no indication that the last permanent secretary to the treasury and the last head of the foreign and commonwealth office are going to join us <e> <s> i can recall no recent occasion when senior civil servants of that calibre have not been invited to join this house and i very much hope that that matter will be speedily rectified <e>", "<cs> my lords i rejoice to hear what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> i hope that it receives substantia attention in the media because i have read as i think all of us have read substantial accounts in the media which appear to come from extremely well-informed sources which suggest that there are just such considerations in the minds of some ministers <e> <s> indeed although the words i have used this evening are my own i hope that the noble earl paid particular attention to the speech of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale which did not appear to conflict in any particularly direct fashion with what i have just said <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i do not think the noble earl did it with his customary skill <e> <s> he may recall that he received a letter from the secretary of the first division association mr ward challenging him on this matter <e> <s> no doubt when he comes to reply i understand that so far he has not done so he will explain what he really meant in his article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of a question on that is the noble earl maintaining that in fact the amount of information available from official sources in this country is as great as it is in washington <e> <s> is that his argument or am i misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the two conflicting statements in the weekend press to which he referred came from no <e> <s> downing street and the other from the treasury <e> <s> would it not be a better idea to avoid two departments making totally contradictory statements on a matter of central importance to the living standards of the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one question on the interesting point that he has just made <e> <s> how can he possibly say what he has said in the light of the use of soviet military power in the streets of east berlin in czechoslovakia and in hungary <e> <s> how can he seriously maintain such an argument <e>", "<cs> my lords like others who have spoken <e> <s> i very much welcome the fact that the noble earl lord bessborough has put this question down this evening <e> <s> the noble earl has made a notable contribution to the european cause and that being so it is particularly appropriate that he has initiated this debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question as regards the guarantees because i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that this is a matter of central importance <e> <s> he has dealt with one aspect of the matter which i put to him but perhaps i may remind him of the second that is are the government prepared to give any type of undertaking to the promoters of whichever project they finally select that there will not be unduly interventionist policies so far as pricing is concerned <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask him whether he agrees that attacks on the homes of research scientists and other people doing valuable work of this kind are unlikely to change the views of anybody on questions of animal welfare <e> <s> does he also agree that these are only part of a whole series of attacks made by that organisation on the homes of many people in various parts of the country <e> <s> that being so may i ask him whether he is taking steps with the chief inspector of constabulary to ensure that everything possible is being done by all the police forces involved to co-ordinate their efforts in dealing with this serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord on two parts of his reply <e> <s> would he not agree that it is particularly satisfactory given the constant complaints that are made about the quality of internal police reports that is the police reporting on the police that such an obviously high quality piece of work has been done by the deputy chief constable of hampshire <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to thank all those who have participated in the debate and who have spoken in difficult conditions where speeches have had to be limited to what in normal circumstances would be an unreasonable length <e> <s> secondly i think that the house has been very nearly unanimous in the views which it has expressed this evening as regards the government <e> <s> given the fact that there has been this element of unanimity and given the fact that people have not been able to speak at length as they would be able to in normal circumstances we shall not press this motion tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount lord whitelaw for having repeated in this house the statement made by the home secretary in another place <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that we too thank him for having honoured in full the commitment that he entered into after the house had decided on an all-party amendment to the telecommunications bill <e> <s> is he aware that we unreservedly welcome the proposal to appoint an independent tribunal to adjudicate upon complaints <e> <s> that is clearly right <e>", "<cs> my lords i will begin by making a few comments on the last two speeches <e> <s> the noble lord lord hylton asked at the beginning of his speech why sir cyril philips had not consulted a number of people before submitting his report to the home secretary <e> <s> that may be a reasonable point but of course subject to one rather important qualification <e> <s> that is as my noble friend lord wigoder pointed out that sir cyril philips was appointed in only december of last year <e> <s> he has had six or seven weeks in which to write this report <e> <s> in my view he has done a notably successful job in producing such a high quality report in so limited a <e>", "<cs> my lords only two years ago as the noble lord lord blake said in his <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how much i agree with what the noble lord lord ardwick has just said <e> <s> the noble lord has made the point that i intended to make in reply to the noble lord lord maude of stratford-upon-avon <e> <s> i find it a little hard to identify with quite the same degree of precision as the noble lord that golden age of journalism which he found rather more easy to identify <e> <s> when one looks at the british press of the nineteenth century one finds a situation in which leaks were constantly made to newspapers and bribes often offered to editors of newspapers from secret service funds <e> <s> i am perfectly aware of the many defects of british journalism at the moment <e> <s> some of these were discussed in the debate on the yorkshire ripper case in this house only a year or so ago <e> <s> i believe however that the noble lord over-stated this point of his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that i was not the only one to misunderstand my noble friend if i may so describe him <e> <s> i am glad that he has made his position clear because he carries great weight rightly in this house outside and in the civil service <e>", "<cs> this is a good alliance speech i can assure the noble lord <e> <s> colonel seelys comments provide almost a classic example of how parliament should not agree to hurry through legislation of this kind <e> <s> there was on both sides of the house total support among conservative party and liberal party members the very limited number of labour members and indeed the irish national party <e> <s> no serious dissent was expressed <e> <s> colonel seeley said <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening so early but may i press the noble lord on that particular example <e> <s> it will be within the recollection of a number of us that a few years ago a senior member of the cabinet made a mistake and left highly confidential cabinet documents in a london restaurant <e> <s> i can recall no suggestion that he should be prosecuted under any section of the official secets act <e>", "<cs> my lords following the point made by the noble lord on the government front bench does he agree first that it would be quite impossible for the parole board to interview several thousand prisoners a year and wholly outside their capacity to undertake such a task <e> <s> secondly is he aware that many of us regard the figures he has given as rather encouraging indicating as they do a reduction in the number of prisoners who have committed offences in the last three years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that many of us are deeply concerned about this particular episode <e> <s> is he aware also that there are few penal establishments in the united kingdom which have had such a series of grave events as has this particular establishment <e> <s> that being so <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord give any indication of when the working party report is to he made available <e> <s> secondly will it be published <e> <s> on that point is the noble and learned lord aware that many of us would not be content were the report not to he publicly available <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl one question <e> <s> he may recall that my noble friend lord chandos asked him specifically what the attitude of the government now is going to be in the light of the current situation so far as the european monetary system is concerned <e> <s> can we now have a reply to that <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i welcome the regulations with very little reservation <e> <s> it is probably appropriate for me to say a few words about them because i was responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> does she not agree that there is increasing public anxiety about the number of such cases which are receiving a great deal of publicity at the moment <e> <s> in the light of this does she not also agree that it is necessary particularly when a childs life is lost or a child is seriously injured that there should both be an independent investigation into what happened and secondly some publication after that investigation as to what went wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to intervene but i rather assumed that the noble lord lord mishcon would speak and i was giving him the opportunity to speak first <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord who is always courteous for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> is the noble lord seriously suggesting to the house that our decision on this question as to whether to enfranchise many tens of thousands of british citizens living in the ec should be dependent upon what happens to five six or seven people who may have gone to spain having committed some fiscal offence as i think he described it <e> <s> is he seriously suggesting that on that argument and that argument alone we should disfranchise a substantial number of our fellow citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords when the house is as empty as it is at the moment i should never think it appropriate to raise the temperature on such a bill as this which apart from our differences on the last amendment is not appropriate for normal party strife <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness lady elles who asked about the position of the opposition in relation to her amendment i should like to say that it has our warm and enthusiastic support <e> <s> i am glad to be able to reassure her that the social democratic and liberal parties will vote for it enthusiastically in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord home has raised this issue and given the fact that third reading is the final stage of the bill so far as this house is concerned and we shall not then be able to return to the issue would it be possible for the noble lord to let us know those of us who have participated in the debate including i am sure the noble lord lord home what is the governments view of this matter certainly a few days before we come to the third reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> i should like to ask whether representations have been made by the west central african department in the foreign and commonwealth office to which her honourable friend the joint minister of state referred in his letter to me to the nigerian high commission pointing out that if any nigerian student in this country is debarred from having the foreign exchange approval which all the students have been assured they would receive it would be most discreditable behaviour by the nigerian government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister of state not realise that none of these educational establishments would have admitted these students if it had not been assured by the nigerian high commission in london that foreign exchange approval would be given <e> <s> in that situation could she not take this matter up most vigorously because the honour of the nigerian high commission in london is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that remarkable answer <e> <s> will he not agree that there is something most unusual about a situation in which the government are incapable of fulfilling their responsibilities to produce remand prisoners at the appropriate time as required by the law <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just put to the noble lord the question which i asked him a few moments ago namely what are the governments statutory responsibilities in terms of producing remand prisoners <e> <s> at a time when the government rightly ask everyone else to observe the law why are they not doing it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that we are debating this bill today but i do not propose to go through the history of it <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> his version of history was rather more accurate than that of the home secretary in another place <e> <s> that is undoubtedly the position but i found it remarkable that the home secretary spent quite so much time boasting that it was a truly wonderful thing that the government brought forward this bill without at any stage referring to the fact that the only reason it was being brought forward was that the government had been defeated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement to this house <e> <s> may i ask him two questions <e> <s> first would he not agree that there is bound to be increasing public concern that this proposal will not only damage the west of scotland as the noble lord lord carmichael has pointed out but will also do devastating damage to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a slight suspicion about the way in which the noble lord and his friends will go but i have also a suspicion that the real argument has not in fact been put by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> what we have to do is to understand from the rather incomprehensible speech if the house will forgive my saying so to which we have just listened how it was that the noble lord and his friend voted for british officials of the european communities to get the vote <e> <s> he is now advocating as we have just heard that british officials of nato should not get the vote <e> <s> he did not i think wholly explain his position <e> <s> but perhaps some words of the noble lord lord glenarthur on the last occasion explain why the opposition front bench have taken the view that they have done <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur was speaking on the proposition on which the noble lord lord stoddart voted of course with his colleagues on the last occasion in support of the noble baronesss amendment to enfranchise british officials of the communities <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur was obviously rather surprised by the attitude of the labour party in this house because of the very different attitude of the labour party in another place <e> <s> indeed at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what he is saying happens to be factually inaccurate <e> <s> many elements of past representation bills have been matters of intense partisan debate <e> <s> i would remind him only of the abolition of the university seats in the parliament <e> <s> what he is saying happens to be entirely untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords i would add only a few words to what my noble friend lord tordoff said <e> <s> in one respect but only one the bill has been improved and that was when the government were defeated at the committee stage on the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> the minister on that occasion did the best he could in undoubtedly difficult circumstances to defend the agreement worked out between the conservative and labour parties in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> obviously we are interested to hear the response of the noble baroness lady vickers but to put it bluntly this is a home office matter and not a matter for a private member of this house <e> <s> before we decide what to do we should like to hear the noble lord the under-secretary of state give his recommendations on this matter <e> <s> many of us are gravely apprehensive about making this offence susceptible to a sentence of life imprisonment <e> <s> we want a very full explanation as to why we should favour that <e> <s> frankly it is a matter for the under-secretary of state and not a matter for the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i shall say only a few words on this issue <e> <s> i realise that we have got ourselves into a difficult position namely that if the noble lord lord monson presses this amendment to a division it may well be that there will not be a quorum in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak very briefly <e> <s> i would say at the outset that what causes us most concern is the point that was raised by the noble lords lord mishcon and lord houghton namely that the committee took a decision on this matter last friday <e> <s> i am therefore slightly surprised to find an amendment down which appears to ignore what the committee then decided <e> <s> we were concerned about one very isolated but very important matter that a single act should not be an offence <e> <s> we now find in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the minister this is a private members bill <e> <s> the noble baroness asks the leave of the house to withdraw her amendment and of course we would be very happy to agree with that and in the meanwhile to discuss the matter to see whether we can reach accommodation which unites us all <e> <s> that is indeed our objective <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may begin by saying how much i agree with what the noble lord lord mishcon has just said he has put forward a <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to discuss the merits of this proposal except to say without i hope being pompous that i understood that we were all entitled only to one speech at report stage <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord lord mishcon had replied to this debate <e> <s> i only say this for the purposes of further debate this evening <e> <s> i may be wrong but no doubt this will be explained to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall respond briefly first to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i think the point he made was answered extremely effectively if i may say so by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it really is not an objection to say as he did that he would like something far more substantial than is proposed in this amendment and to give that as a reason for opposing progress in a more limited area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the minister for mentioning that example because i raised the matter in the house <e> <s> will he join with me in expressing surprise that the government whips were used to defeat an amendment to precisely that bill which would have stopped that expenditure in islington <e>", "<cs> my lords tempting though it would be to follow every aspect of lord houghtons speech i shall do my best to resist that temptation <e> <s> i should say at the outset not that my noble friend lord wigoder requires any defence from me that i assume that we are all speaking as private members of this house and not as members of political parties <e> <s> this is a private members bill and it is on that basis that i am speaking <e> <s> i do not have the remotest idea what the views of the social democratic party are on this particular measure or this particular amendment and i am not particularly concerned because in my view it is for us as private members to decide what is the right thing to do and i assume that is the way we shall all approach it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the statement he has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord denham aware that the statement he has made that all the stages of the sporting events control of alcohol etc <e> <s> bill will be taken in a single day is deeply objectionable to a number of us <e> <s> to adopt that procedure would be quite wrong <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that many of us regard it as entirely wrong that new criminal offences should be put on the statute book without proper parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> is the noble lord aware also that a number of us will be opposing the business motion next tuesday in the most emphatic terms <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is also unusual to put down such a motion on such a bill <e> <s> is he aware that one of the last occasions on which that was done was in for the official secrets act <e> <s> after a precedent of that kind is it not desirable to give this house at least two days to debate a matter of such considerable importance <e>", "<cs> i have done so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we on these benches warmly welcome what she has said and give her our total support <e>", "<cs> my lords having raised this matter last thursday perhaps i may first express my gratitude to the noble viscount for his statement today indicating that the government have had second thoughts <e> <s> secondly i wish to say as i did last thursday that no one on these benches denies the need to have this bill on the statute book before the beginning of the next football season <e> <s> i also wish to say to the noble viscount that we all recognise that in a situation of national emergency in certain circumstances it is necessary to put through bills in a single day <e> <s> indeed as a home office minister i did that with the prevention of terrorism bill in this house and the necessary facilities were granted by the then opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall echo some of the words of the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble viscount for his general response to the amendments which have been moved in your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by saying that i very much agreed with what the noble and learned lord has just said <e> <s> i am as it happens fairly firmly opposed to a general right of privacy being embodied in english law <e> <s> i believe that a very substantial series of problems would arise were we to do that <e> <s> nevertheless if by chance the noble and learned lord was referring to a recent example where in the view of many of us fleet street has behaved in an intolerable fashion i entirely agree with everything he said <e> <s> but on the narrower question of the issues raised in this bill i should like to say just three things <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up this debate on behalf of those sitting on these benches i should first like to join with others in congratulating the noble lord lord donoughue on a most outstanding maiden speech <e> <s> i can say that for several reasons the first of which is that i largely agreed with the thrust of his argument that this bill is in some respects too wide and in other respects too narrow <e> <s> i think that that is a correct diagnosis <e> <s> but i join with him also in saying and i think it is common ground in all parts of the house that the government were right to introduce this legislation and it is clearly right for parliament to proceed with it with dispatch so that it is on the statute book before the beginning of the new football season <e>", "<cs> my lords for reasons which i am just about to explain i find that argument rather unpersuasive <e> <s> i will now say why <e> <s> if the noble lords position and that of the government is accepted by the house then it will mean that the bill will be extended way beyond football <e> <s> it can be taken into cricket into rugby union and even in the final analysis into tennis <e> <s> the noble viscount is not in the chamber and i am not sure whether he is aware of this but the provisions of the bill could even be taken into his own game of golf all without being compelled to secure explicit parliamentary approval even by the very limited device of the affirmative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening in the ministers speech but i am afraid that i must make it clear that we on these benches would not be able to accept that and if the noble lord lord mishcon withdraws the amendments as of course he could and does not move them at report stage they will be put down in the name of myself and my noble friends <e> <s> we do not believe that agreements of this sort taken in private should in fact come before our duty as members of the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords how can that have an effect on public order <e> <s> that is the point which some of us find difficult to understand <e> <s> why does it make it more likely that there will be disorder if a person has the opportunity of seeing what is happening <e> <s> i find it extremely difficult to follow the logic of this part of the argument <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord lord monson was not in the chamber when i began to address the committee <e> <s> i indicated that this was entirely a probing amendment relating primarily to ships <e> <s> i am not seriously suggesting that the amendment should be carried <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i have indicated already that this is entirely a probing amendment <e> <s> i would only say as i am sure the government recognise that when we start playing football in europe again this matter will have to be looked at very seriously <e> <s> i believe that our european partners will want some pretty explicit guarantees before we are allowed to play football on the mainland of europe <e> <s> nevertheless i am entirely content with what the noble lord said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> somerset has one other great advantage at the moment and that is an alliance majority on the county council and therefore there will undoubtedly be a transformation of the behaviour of somerset <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not be astonished to learn that his answer left me totally unconvinced and i am afraid i must say to him that he also left the entire committee unconvinced <e> <s> every single member of your lordships committee who has spoken in this debate has been critical of the governments position <e>", "<cs> the new definition put down by the minister improves what was an unsatisfactory situation <e> <s> we cannot in any event as the noble lord in the chair has pointed out pursue our own amendments this evening the amendments of the noble lord lord mishcon and myself because they are caught by the terms of the amendment of the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> i should like to consider again the general questions involved in this issue <e> <s> i shall not add anything more this evening <e> <s> i have already deployed with some vigour the argument about the bottle of orange squash <e> <s> i shall not trouble the committee with it again this evening though i fear i may have to trouble your lordships again next wednesday <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will look at this matter again <e> <s> the point made a few moments ago that the three last serious disturbances in this country took place on grounds where there was no alcohol demonstrates one problem <e> <s> it is a problem which will confront the government if the bill goes on the statute book in its present form <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is saying that it probably would not help <e> <s> can he say why it would not help <e> <s> it seems to many of us that it would help a great deal <e>", "<cs> they suspect it <e>", "<cs> my lords is not part of the answer to the question of the noble lord lord glenarthur that although some violence is alcohol related a lot is not and that is obvious <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak very briefly because the committee has devoted a substantial amount of time to this amendment <e> <s> on the other hand it is an important issue <e> <s> if the legislation goes through in its present form it will undoubtedly do substantial damage to a number of football clubs <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord really saying that he is declining i am sure he is not to meet a number of members of the house between now and next wednesday <e> <s> surely it is in the governments own interests to agree <e> <s> otherwise we shall have a very tiresome report stage on the bill <e> <s> i pointed out earlier to the noble lord lord glenarthur that there is some obligation on the government given the very speedy way in which this bill is being put on the statute book to try to make some concessions <e> <s> frankly the noble lord lord glenarthur has not made a single concession this evening <e> <s> he has not even begun to imply that he is prepared to move in any direction at all <e> <s> it has been resist resist resist at every stage <e> <s> i do not believe that that is reasonable <e>", "<cs> to do with public order legislation <e>", "<cs> as i have already indicated that i am not going to press the matter the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that that is still my view despite a remarkably inadequate response <e> <s> i must say that if i had had the job of replying to that amendment i hope i would have produced one or two slightly better arguments than the point about the fire brigade <e> <s> if ever there was a weak threadbare argument it was that one <e>", "<cs> yes very well <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> but of course it will be for the operational decision of a chief constable how this matter is enforced <e> <s> it is not primarily a matter for the home office <e> <s> it will be force orders which will go out on the basis of this piece of legislation <e> <s> i see the problem about insisting that it should be an officer of the rank of inspector certainly in an emergency situation <e> <s> on the other hand i am slightly nervous that quite bluntly some probationer constable may over-react in some circumstances <e> <s> we are all aware that probationer constables make up a significant proportion of the police force and one could over-react in a particular situation and close a bar <e> <s> then there could be a situation of more difficulty than if the bar had been left open in the first instance <e> <s> it is probably very difficult to do this on the face of the bill but it is a matter which should be carefully considered with the chief inspector of constabulary and there should be informal consultations with the association of chief police officers <e>", "<cs> i propose to move neither of those amendments <e>", "<cs> i shall not try to pin any words on the minister but i welcome the note struck in his intervention <e> <s> on that basis i gladly withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that was one of the most remarkable speeches i have had the good fortune to hear since i became a member of your lordships house <e> <s> the one thing the noble lord did not explain was why he took exactly the opposite position when this matter was debated and voted upon on the last occasion <e> <s> i see from the division list on the absurd amendment as described by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord apparently did not take that view on the local government legislation that we were voting on a few moment ago <e> <s> i notice that there has been a rather remarkable change in his position <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that there is something particularly objectionable in making crude political propaganda of this kind available and injecting it into the curriculum of a number of schools in london <e> <s> does he not agree that there is something particularly wrong and particularly undesirable about making a film with the almost deliberate intention of worsening relations between children and the police and between the ethnic minorities and the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his remarks this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him in the light of the very helpful comments made by the noble lord lord mishcon whether he does not agree that it would be particularly admirable if the leader of the labour party now asked the ilea to withdraw the film in question <e>", "<cs> my lords it always gives me pleasure to agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i was just wondering whether the fact that lord wigoders children could not go to a match constituted a national emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak very briefly <e> <s> by way of introduction i should say that i am grateful to the noble lord and to the minister of state for having met a number of us earlier this week <e> <s> and i am grateful to the noble lord for having said that he and his right honourable friends would ensure that in any public order legislation in the next session or thereafter the bills long title would be drawn in such a fashion as to make this bill amendable <e> <s> i think that that is important and i am grateful for it having been said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am much obliged to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> this matter was drawn to my attention by my noble friend lord crawshaw of aintree and both he and i are grateful to him for having met our point completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked one specific question to which unhappily i have not had an answer <e> <s> it was this <e> <s> what other sports were consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the answer that i believe was going to be given <e> <s> in other words the government have come forward with legislation and have asked parliament to confer these remarkable powers and they have not discussed them nor even notified the other sports which are only now beginning to discover that this piece of legislation could be extended to them and that if it were it would have the most swingeing economic effects to which i have referred already today on many of the mass spectator sports in this country <e> <s> what is the argument for the negative resolution procedure put forward by the noble lord the parliamentary under-secretary <e> <s> first there is the safety of sports grounds act which <e>", "<cs> precisely my lords <e> <s> and what i have been saying to the house this afternoon is that it is not good enough for the minister to say there is this piece of scottish legislation <e> <s> we must automatically follow the scottish example <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly wise enough not to follow the noble lord on that particular point <e> <s> i am quite sure that he would have the advantage of me in any debate on that question <e> <s> whatever may be the admirable features of the scottish legal system i am saying that the idea that we have to follow the scottish example as far as this particular piece of legislation is concerned is i should have thought one of the less impressive arguments which have been put to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always glad to be interrupted by the noble lord and i will <e>", "<cs> my lords i started off speaking very briefly and the house will be gratified to learn that i propose to reply very briefly too <e> <s> as i indicated i do not propose to press this amendment <e> <s> the minister met us to some extent on the long title of the public order bill <e> <s> we will be able to go through these matters again and speaking from these benches we shall do so <e> <s> i shall explain very briefly why <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is she aware that most of us are most eager to see this legislation come before parliament <e> <s> is she aware that the statement made by the lord chief justice at a judges dinner represents the overwhelming view of public opinion in this country that one must make now a determined attack upon those responsible for making fortunes out of this trade <e> <s> secondly may i ask whether the legislation will cover the channel islands as well as the situation in great britain given the fact of an increasing number of allegations that financial institutions in the channel islands are being used in the course of this traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question directly on the point put by the noble lord lord dean of beswick relating to the membership card scheme <e> <s> a moment ago my noble friend lord wigoder said that as we understood it when this idea was propounded by the government it was directed towards keeping out trouble makers <e> <s> is the noble lord aware as the noble lord lord dean pointed out that mr justice popplewell is going far further by excluding all visiting fans <e> <s> is he further aware that in the summary of recommendations which has been distributed by the government this afternoon the government say that this is a matter for the football authorities and clubs but that the government hope that they will be given serious consideration <e> <s> is that a neutral statement or does it imply that the government believe that such a scheme should be enforced <e> <s> as my noble friend pointed out it would have substantial consequences for english football and in the view of many it would go much too far <e>", "<cs> my lords on the particular point of <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the noble lord has already had one question <e> <s> i am now following it up <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness whether she will give particular attention to this question of bail hostels <e> <s> is she aware that the growth of the prison population is already outstripping the growth of the number of new places which are being provided in this building programme <e> <s> that being so will she consider particularly whether some of this money could not be diverted to the construction of bail hostels which apart from anything else are a great deal cheaper than places in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> does the noble lord not welcome the arrival into the european community of two young democracies <e> <s> does he not realise that one of the most hopeful features of what is happening in europe is that those two countries are entering the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with one point made by the noble lord lord glenarthur and the noble lord lord mishcon that is how much we welcome the prospect of the maiden speech of the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> the noble lord had a distinguished career in the house of commons and since then he has been particularly active with the london docklands development corporation which has done some remarkable work in docklands and illustrates if i may say so how much advantage is to be gained from having a constructive relationship between the public and private sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for repeating the answer made by his right honourable friend perhaps i may say that i will not put a number of questions to him now given the fact that we shall be debating this matter next week <e> <s> however perhaps i may ask him two questions <e> <s> first is he aware that the situation mentioned in the statement he has made is caused by the grossly irresponsible behaviour of the present majority on liverpool city council <e> <s> is he aware that in the last few days the deputy leader of her majestys opposition has indicated that he has evidence of corruption as far as liverpool city council is concerned <e> <s> in the light of that statement may i ask him whether arrangements are being made by the merseyside police to ensure that they obtain such evidence as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the minister the question was different <e> <s> it was whether there should be any form of independent research on this question <e> <s> is that going to be undertaken or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend section of the gaming act to make provision for the redemption of cheques and to amend section of that act as to the records to be kept with respect to cheques <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a senior official of the office of the director of public prosecutions has referred to the quite monstrous workload facing officials in that department <e> <s> what are the government doing to rectify that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking all those who have participated in the debate including the noble lord lord elton with whose peroration i agreed entirely as did i am sure the overwhelming majority if not all members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i think the house heard the noble baroness and it must draw its own conclusions from what she said <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that at one stage the noble baroness referred to the liberal council <e> <s> at another moment she referred to the hung council and said that one of the problems of liverpool was that there had been a hung council <e> <s> with great respect she had better make sure which of the two arguments she wants to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble lord one point put earlier by my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i refer to the additional resources in terms of officials to be made available to carry out these responsibilities <e> <s> i realise that the question is one that the noble lord may not be able to answer today but he might perhaps follow it up in correspondence <e> <s> how many additional officials above the equivalent rank of say principal in the home civil service will be appointed to carry out these responsibilities <e> <s> there is no point as i am sure the noble lord would agree in giving these additional responsibilities without having the staff back-up to do the necessary work <e> <s> is he aware that there have already been many criticisms of the inadequancy of existing arrangements to deal with company fraud one made by a senior official in the office of the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> is he aware secondly of the woefully inadequate arrangements that we have in terms of the joint fraud squad between the metropolitan police and the city of london police <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount when the solicitor-general was informed that this letter had been leaked from the office of the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> secondly is he aware that many of us remain puzzled as to why there was a leak inquiry at all <e> <s> given the fact that on the basis of the statement we have heard from the noble viscount this afternoon this leak took place as a result of approval given by the prime ministers own office why did the prime minister then order an inquiry at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble viscount but on the last point that he made in answer to my second question may i ask him whether his case is that the prime minister was not told by members of the office that they had given authority to the secretary of state for trade and industry to leak this letter <e> <s> is that correct or is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is designed to implement two of the recommendations made by the royal commission on gambling under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord rothschild <e> <s> it would amend section of the gaming act which relates to the provision of credit and the use of cheques <e> <s> i shall set out the central purposes of this bill fairly briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to all who have spoken not least the noble viscount <e> <s> all concerned have supported the central purpose of the bill and i have to detain the house for only a few minutes in order to deal with one or two questions which have been asked primarily by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and also by the noble lord lord kilbracken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord home with whose speech i found myself in almost total agreement particularly on the last point he made to which i shall come later <e> <s> i can say without hesitation that this has been one of the most interesting debates in which i have participated and that we all owe a debt of gratitude to the noble baroness lady cox for having introduced this subject today <e> <s> i fear that that view of mine does not appear to be shared by the opposition front bench but nevertheless the noble baroness will no doubt contain her sorrow with her customary fortitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said <e> <s> as he rightly reminded the committee he indicated his firm support for the bill on second reading <e> <s> as he pointed out the intention of these amendments is in no way to affect its central purpose <e> <s> in some cases they are rather more than drafting amendments <e> <s> i can assure him as i have told <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilbracken has rightly said that this is really a drafting amendment <e> <s> we looked at it carefully with the legal authorities responsible for these matters <e> <s> i do not believe that the problem as the noble lord has set it out will be a matter of any difficulty <e> <s> it is primarily a question of the use of language rather than any particular issue of principle <e> <s> reasonable men can take different views on what is the right form of words to use <e> <s> on the basis of the advice that we have received we have concluded that the present form of wording is preferable to the alternative <e> <s> it is a narrow issue as the noble lord lord kilbracken indicated when he pointed out that it was a drafting issue <e> <s> the position is that we preferred our own choice of language having as a result of what the noble lord said discussed this with the authorities concerned <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble viscount cares to add anything <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilbracken quite reasonably asked the question why does this issue have to be dealt with at all <e> <s> i shall endeavour to explain very briefly why it does indeed have to be dealt with <e> <s> it would be a matter of substance were this amendment to be incorporated in the bill <e>", "<cs> the problem about this particular amendment is that it would make no allowance for a situation arising in a casino which necessitated some temporary interruption to gaming <e> <s> one has to accept in these days that not only is there the risk of a fire alarm going off but there could easily be a bomb scare as a result of which the casino had to be evacuated <e> <s> the wording of the bill in terms of <e>", "<cs> it is always difficult to decide how clear to make a statute <e> <s> on balance we came to the conclusion that it was desirable to make it absolutely clear and that is why that particular form of words appear <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank all who have participated in the debate <e> <s> i hope that it has been useful i believe that it has <e> <s> i should have been mildly surprised had the noble lord lord glenarthur announced the home secretarys decision on metropolitan police manpower in a debate such as this and he was not in a position to do so <e> <s> but he will realise from what has been said in this house the expectation on all sides that there must be a substantial increase in its manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the scornful laughter from the opposition benches which greeted the noble lord a moment ago is the noble lord the minister not aware that it was quite obvious when we entered the community what was the role of the european court of justice <e> <s> is he aware that in the light of that decision a labour government and a labour foreign secretary asked the people of britain in a referendum to vote in favour of british membership of the community <e> <s> the people did so by an overwhelming majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords like everyone who has spoken in this debate i welcome this bill <e> <s> it is an appropriate course of action for the government to have taken following the decision of the appellate committee of your lordships house on the operation julie case to which the noble and learned lord lord denning referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right i have no objection <e> <s> but does he realise that he raised the question of the strength of the customs and excise and not i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words not having spoken before on this particular amendment before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate replies <e> <s> i too very much hope the noble and learned lord will say that he is prepared to examine this matter between now and third reading <e> <s> i am quite sure that he will read what has been said with the utmost care but i am sure it would give us even greater pleasure if he could tell us that he was able to move in the direction suggested by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> let me just say a few words on that point because the noble lord lord glenarthur anticipated the question i was about to ask him <e> <s> i am sure that my noble and learned ally if i may so describe him on this amendment would accept what the noble lord lord glenarthur has just said as long as and clearly on the understanding that we are able to come back to this issue either at report stage or if the discussions with the banks have not been completed by then on third reading <e> <s> i do not believe that at the moment this bill deals adequately with the question of money laundering <e> <s> i think many of our anxieties would be put at rest if either this amendment or something similar to it were written into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that no one who is aware of the critical situation in northern ireland wants to create trouble between london and dublin <e> <s> is he aware that that would be the height of irresponsibility <e> <s> is he also aware of the fact that there is concern in all parts of the house about how this sad situation arose <e> <s> will he agree that it is desirable to have as early as possible a more detailed factual statement <e> <s> it would be far better to have an inquiry but if we cannot have that many of us feel that there should be a detailed factual statement on this whole matter which will undoubtedly take some time to compile but it would enable members of this house and another place to form a far more balanced view of this grave situation than they can this afternoon <e>", "<cs> not altogether surprisingly i take the view rather different from the one that has just been expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon who as always has spoken in a most persuasive fashion <e> <s> i am bound to say that he was not so persuasive as to explain to my satisfaction why the dangerous precedent which he saw was being established by the amendment did not apply to clauses and as well <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say just two things to the noble lord lord glenarthur before the noble and learned lord replies <e> <s> speaking for myself as one of the noble and learned lords supporters i would prefer not to press the amendment today but to wait and see what the government come up with on the earlier amendment <e> <s> it does not cover exactly the same ground it goes far wider that is certainly true <e> <s> but i think at that stage we shall be able to form a view quite bluntly of whether we are satisfied with the general direction in which the government are going <e>", "<cs> speaking on behalf of my noble friends and myself i agree that it will probably be sensible to move in the direction foreshadowed by the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> i think it might create certain evidential problems but nevertheless i believe it is right to do it for the reasons he indicated <e>", "<cs> before we move from that point obviously one would like the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the question put earlier by the noble lord lord soames has not been answered by him <e> <s> it has been answered by the noble lord lord bruce of donington but not by him <e> <s> perhaps i may put it to the noble lord again <e> <s> he says that this decision to which he was not a party which we all recognise but of course he has advice available to him was taken on national interest grounds <e> <s> the question is a simple one <e> <s> these negotiations went on for a substantial period of time as the noble lord is well aware <e> <s> when was that definition of the national interest made by ministers <e>", "<cs> i hope to speak only briefly on this amendment <e> <s> let me start by agreeing strongly with what has been said by my noble friend lord ritchie of dundee <e> <s> i do not start with a passionate prejudice against pupil governors <e> <s> i sit on the governing body of a polytechnic in london which includes students who play a useful role <e> <s> however i would be very concerned at any suggestion that pupil governors should be substituted for parents <e> <s> i can see the sort of political massaging that could go on in some local education authorities to bring about what would be in my view an extremely unsatisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> is he aware to take one example that in the case of the local authority in islington an advertising boycott is directed at the local weekly newspaper the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that i think we are all gratified to hear from the noble lord that he has moved with such dispatch to deal with the judgment of the european court on this question <e> <s> we also hope that we shall have an opportunity of getting at third reading in perhaps slightly more detail the character of the amendments which may be tabled in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that many of us who are firm supporters of the north atlantic alliance find this a deeply depressing day in that we are put in the position of criticising the united states which is something that we have no desire whatsoever to do aware as we are of the crucial importance of a close relationship between the people of western europe and the united states <e> <s> is he aware also that there is the most overwhelming <e>", "<cs> i speak briefly as one of the signatories to one of the amendments before the committee <e> <s> i agreed very much with the speech of the noble baroness lady cox in moving the amendment and also with the speech of the noble viscount lord tonypandy <e> <s> the noble viscounts speech carried with it the overwhelming majority of support in this committee <e> <s> there is as he said a real problem <e> <s> i hope that when the government come to respond to this amendment they will speak in the context of that situation <e> <s> nothing is more pointless than to have this constant request for more and more examples <e> <s> examples are given and then one is asked for more and more examples <e> <s> it is a rather circular situation <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble earl will take seriously what the noble lord lord home has just said <e> <s> there is strong support for doing something in this area <e> <s> i think most of us recognise that drafting this is difficult and extremely complex but i hope he will accept the general sense of the committee over this question and give an undertaking to look at this matter and try to come forward with something incorporating the language just used by the noble lord lord home <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord renton deals with that point i am sure he will have noticed cuttings from the <e>", "<cs> i begin by saying that i am quite sure the wording of this amendment rather like those we were discussing before we adjourned could be improved as the noble earl has suggested <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble lord said a few moments ago <e> <s> inevitably a debate of this kind is almost by definition unbalanced because one is attempting to persuade the government to change a bill before the committee <e> <s> inevitably one talks in critical terms about undoubtedly a minority of the teaching profession <e> <s> that is perfectly true <e> <s> it would be absurd were we to imply that the majority of teachers behaved in the way about which we are complaining because obviously they do not <e>", "<cs> i find the use of the word unbelievable perhaps slightly excessive in the light of the fact that this document was referred to in public at a meeting of liverpool education committee and not one labour member of that committee made any suggestion of the kind that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is now making <e>", "<cs> i move away from the important question of eton to the inner london education authority <e> <s> a few moments ago the noble baroness lady cox referred to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a question of those responsible for the management of the bill <e> <s> how long do they suggest we should sit until <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all who have participated in this debate <e> <s> this is an important and serious issue and that has been recognised by noble lords in all parts of the committee <e> <s> i can immediately answer one question put to me by the noble lord who has just resumed his seat <e> <s> i give him an absolute guarantee that this matter will come up again on report and frankly if we do not get a better answer then we shall vote <e>", "<cs> i had assumed that i had incurred the displeasure of the noble earl when he rose <e> <s> however let me repeat the point that i was making and then i propose to sit down <e> <s> we are asked to believe that a group of trotsky-ist schoolmasters are to be prevented from barring the police as a result of two circulars <e> <s> quite bluntly that is nonsense <e> <s> those who drafted the argument were talking nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that since the end of there have been regular meetings of european community ministers of the interior <e> <s> in view of the fact that the terrorist situation in europe is now quite clearly escalating is it proposed that there should be a special meeting of these ministers in the near future or not <e> <s> if the noble baroness is not able to answer that question this afternoon perhaps she will do so tomorrow <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful as i am sure would the committee to see the letter that the noble baroness lady young eventually sends to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i say this particularly in relation to poundswick school because many of us have been seriously concerned about what we have read <e> <s> many of us want to ensure that children involved in a disciplinary situation of a grievous kind should have some right of appeal <e> <s> at the same time having said that i am sure that many of us are seriously concerned about the climate of violence which now exists in a number of schools not only in manchester but in other parts of the country <e> <s> that being so it seems to me that the issue which has been raised today is of considerable importance <e> <s> as i say together with i am sure noble lords in other parts of the <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness wants me to re-open the issues raised on the previous amendment i shall gladly do so <e> <s> however i should have thought that as the noble lord lord denham has expressed his disquiet at the amount of time we have been devoting to this bill it seems mildly strange that a minister should invite one to re-open issues on which the committee has taken a decision <e> <s> i find that a rather bizarre suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government had agreed to try to attempt a consensus in this house it is almost certain that they would not have lost the bill in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by taking up a point made by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and that is what nearly happened at heathrow yesterday <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble baroness will specifically deal with the matter when she comes to reply <e> <s> only because an el al plane was involved did we prevent people being blown to pieces over the centre of london and that despite constant reassurances from ministers that every possible step has been taken at heathrow and other british airports to deal with the terrorist threat <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the report of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies was submitted to and implemented by the present governments predecessors <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at the outset that despite the fact that the noble lord lord orr-ewing and i may differ about the report of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies and its timing i agreed very much with what he said <e> <s> we were discussing these issues only the other day on the education bill and it is absolutely essential that they are dealt with because young children are at risk of violent crime <e> <s> it is vital that every possible step should be taken to safeguard them certainly by means of policemen going to schools <e> <s> i find it deplorable that in a limited number of schools in london and now elsewhere that has been made impossible as a result of the action of some members of the teaching staffs <e> <s> i very much hope that the house will agree with that view when we come to discuss this matter again on the report stage of the education bill <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord orr-ewing that that is fundamental <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord lord glenarthur as he may recall whether there was any possibility of his telling us the decision of the home secretary on the application made by the commissioner of police for the metropolis for increased resources <e> <s> in our last debate two months ago the noble lord said that it was on the home secretarys table <e> <s> what is the situation now <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a few remarks <e> <s> a few moments ago the noble lord lord sandys said that he knew of no precedent for this <e> <s> i never regard that by itself as an overwhelming argument <e> <s> it is sometimes a good idea to take some step of an innovative character and undoubtedly this proposal is one such step <e>", "<cs> it is disappointing that the noble lord is so inflexible <e> <s> he did not have the opportunity of dealing with one point that i endeavoured to put to him and i am sorry to have to take up a small amount of time in repeating it <e> <s> there has been constant criticism during the lifetime of this government just as there was in the lifetime of the previous labour government and the previous conservative government as well about the powers of ministerial patronage <e>", "<cs> i wonder when we are to hear a government spokesman on this bill say that he has been persuaded by any argument ever <e> <s> we had this on the telecommunications bill <e> <s> there was total resistance <e> <s> we are having the same again except that the committee is now sitting only because the opposition were good enough to supply the government with a quorum on the last debate <e> <s> it is a most extraordinary situation that on the major privatisation measure in parliament the government cannot keep their supporters in the committee to support them in the division lobby and provide them with a quorum <e>", "<cs> may i start by saying to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who has just resumed his seat that often i find him a very persuasive advocate even when i do not happen to agree with his conclusion <e> <s> however i did not find his speech this afternoon so persuasive <e> <s> let me explain why <e> <s> as i understand it his argument is that if the minister has powers to appoint a number of people rather than one that undermines the position of the principal officer concerned with the matter <e> <s> that is a curious doctrine <e>", "<cs> please <e>", "<cs> with great respect the noble lord has just repeated the point which i have endeavoured to answer <e> <s> i do not think that that is a persuasive argument for the reasons that i have cited already <e> <s> this is constantly done and if the noble lord would encourage me to do so i could find plenty more <e> <s> the director general or whoever is the principal officer appointed by a secretary of state does not feel that he is in some mysterious way undermined because the secretary of state has appointed others to subordinate positions <e>", "<cs> i shall give way in just a second if i may <e> <s> that is why i find the argument put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter unimpressive <e> <s> of course i acknowledge the fact that the noble lord says i am sure rightly that he is concerned about the position of the consumer <e> <s> speaking for my noble friends i am sure that we shall gladly support any proposal emanating from the noble lord which strengthens the position of the consumer so far as this bill is concerned <e> <s> what does concern us this relates directly to the point made by my noble friend lady burton of coventry is that in the previous examples where we have transferred power from a public monopoly to a private monopoly the position of the consumer has already been gravely undermined and we see nothing in this bill which satisfies us that we have learnt from that experience <e>", "<cs> to answer the precise point the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has put to me i do not think that is the central question <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a precise question <e> <s> these are civil service appointments to be approved by the first civil service commissioner <e> <s> can it be made clear precisely who gives authority for the appointments <e>", "<cs> i am putting a point of some importance <e> <s> there was a dispute about mr levenes appointment to the ministry of defence <e> <s> undertakings were given that in the future all appointments of the character of mr levenes would be cleared by the first civil service commissioner <e> <s> is that the case here or is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in thanking the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> as has been said it is one of the most serious statements that has been made in the history of the prison service <e> <s> i think that we must all recognise that at the outset <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there have been recent reports emanating from a member of the prison officers <e>", "<cs> i was not if i may say so wholly persuaded by the noble lord lord gray of contin in his speech a few moments ago <e> <s> perhaps he will not be surprised to hear that nevertheless i do not really think that we finally determined the question of the position of parliament on this matter <e> <s> we discussed the narrow issue on a previous quite important debate about whether in fact parliament should be in some way involved in the appointment process <e> <s> we are talking here of something wholly different <e> <s> and when the noble lord lord gray of <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i noted what the noble lord said <e> <s> he told us that in the sad event of the noble lord lord denham no longer being the government chief whip in this house he as his replacement <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for repeating the home secretarys statement in the house of commons may i ask him whether he agrees that last nights wretched events have undoubtedly done a great deal of damage to the self-confidence and reputation of the british prison service <e> <s> can i ask him whether notwithstanding that he will pass on to the many dedicated prison governors and staff who did not abandon their positions last evening our congratulations and i am sure i speak for many in all parts of the house <e> <s> without them people would have lost their lives last night and it is right that the courageous men who stayed at their posts should have public tribute paid to them <e> <s> i hope that these words will be passed to the prison service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one or two questions specifically <e> <s> there is a suggestion of an unconfirmed report of the death of two inmates at northeye <e> <s> if the minister will forgive my saying so that is rather a strange statement <e> <s> have bodies been discovered <e> <s> if the prison department now has total possession of northeye prison why should there be any doubt about this <e> <s> no doubt there is an explanation and i am sure we should like to have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i would agree with what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> confronted with amendments to a government bill it is appropriate to say something about them <e> <s> i join with the noble lord in thanking the minister for having written to us with an explanation what were the governments intentions in the series of amendments that we are now discussing <e> <s> having said that i very much regret that some of those amendments have arrived relatively late in the day and that some are starred government amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing the regret of the noble and learned lord lord denning that he is unable to be present today <e> <s> as the noble lord lord glenarthur has said this was an amendment that was put down by the noble and learned lord and supported from these benches <e> <s> unhappily the noble and learned lord has an engagement which made it impossible for him to be with your lordships though he wants to reassure the minister that he will do his best to be present on the third reading of this bill and in the interval between now and then he will wish to consider the terms of this particular amendment in order to ensure that as far as he is concerned in his view it is wholly adequate for its purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords since we are coming to the end of our proceedings may i ask an wholly unreasonable question for which i shall not ask for an answer tonight <e> <s> as these provisions are being extended to scotland i cannot recall whether we have discussed the situation in relation to northern ireland banks <e> <s> i do not press the point tonight but no doubt the matter is being looked at and no doubt it has already been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl about the agencies at shildon horwich and swindon which have been established by brel with the support of the local authorities <e> <s> the statement referred to their success and that point has been repeated this afternoon <e> <s> can he tell us how many new jobs have been created in each of these three areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that a most puzzling answer <e> <s> why on earth should the government resist this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness has found it quite impossible to give any coherent answer to that question save only that she wishes to avoid prescription by central government <e> <s> surely one of the objects of the whole exercise we have been discussing in terms of this bill is to ensure the maximum involvement of parents with the school <e> <s> in many rural areas it will be difficult as the noble baroness has acknowledged and as was pointed out by the noble lord lord renton on a previous occasion for parents to come to meetings <e> <s> many rural bus services as we are aware are being axed <e> <s> in a situation of this kind it seems wholly reasonable that the government should make it absolutely clear on the face of the bill that there is a duty to ensure that people who wish to cast their vote in a postal ballot should be able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble earl lord longford perhaps i may say on behalf of my noble friends that there are a substantial number of non-conservative members of the house who regard this matter as extremely serious who regard what is happening in a number of schools particularly in inner london as alarming and consider that it is time that parliament began to take the matter seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps may first say that i welcome these amendments <e> <s> as i have already made clear i think that this represents a substantial improvement of the bill <e> <s> it is right to say as the noble baroness said a few moments ago that this is the first time there has been any explicit statutory position for the police in any education legislation <e> <s> i welcome that but having said that i welcome it i am bound to say that years ago i should have regarded it as quite inconceivable that we needed to have a debate on this issue in the first place <e> <s> we have needed it because of the well publicised cases in london and elsewhere where a militant minority of teachers have tried to make the position of the police totally impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us who know the noble viscount are aware that if he gives his word he will of course honour it <e> <s> the noble viscount has made perfectly clear the position arising from the point raised by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> it seems to me that we should accept what the noble viscount has said <e> <s> we know that he is a man of his word <e> <s> we shall come back to the matter on third reading <e> <s> it would be a profound mistake given the generous words that he has used not to accept what he has offered <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make one fairly minor point <e> <s> i welcome this amendment as i did the previous ones <e> <s> the only assurance i should like is that the whole issue will be monitored by her majestys inspectors <e> <s> i hope that will be done because it would reassure many were we to receive that guarantee <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that not only is the commissioner getting only a fraction of what he has asked for in terms of increased manpower to answer the question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but he is having to wait four years in order to get them <e> <s> would the noble lord not accept that many of us regard what he has announced as wholly unsatisfactory and would he also accept that what he says about resources in police training establishments is frankly untrue <e> <s> is he aware that on that point there are resources available in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just ask one last question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that he used the position of the chief inspector of constabulary in his evaluation of metropolitan manpower needs in order to justify his position <e> <s> is he aware that the inspectorate of constabulary has no role whatever in relation to the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> i too having listened to the discussion share the scepticism of my noble friend lord tordoff <e> <s> i speak as a non-enthusiast for this bill which is another piece of doctrinaire legislation which in my view has very little merit <e> <s> however on the actual proposal now before us it seemed to me that the noble lord lord carmichael did not deal with the point of substance made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter which is this it is perfectly right to say that banks are sometimes represented on the <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with whom i agreed in his last speech i am afraid that on this occasion i must part company with him <e> <s> if the same administration is responsible for two pieces of legislation then in those two pieces of legislation they can treat such a matter entirely differently but they must satisfy your lordships that there are rational grounds for dealing with the matter wholly differently <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him first how many of the local authorities have yet replied <e> <s> secondly is he aware that the minister has substantial powers under the public libraries act in sections and and that it is disappointing to some of us that those powers have not been exercised as yet <e> <s> finally is the noble lord aware that this type of totalitarian behaviour by local authorities in taking newspapers out of public libraries because they dislike the proprietor of the newspapers is wholly unworthy of people involved in local government administration in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord belstead join the rest of the house in expressing the hope that the labour-controlled councils which have been involved in this practice will listen to what their own national executive has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not any national interest involved <e> <s> this is exactly the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if it becomes clear that there is a risk that this country will not have enough airport capacity what steps will the government then take <e> <s> that is the question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> so far the noble earl has not addressed himself to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did intervene earlier on this point and the noble earl chastised me for having interrupted him when he said he was going to come and give a full and adequate answer to the questions which had been put to him <e> <s> as the house will realise none of the questions in fact has been answered <e> <s> the noble earl has now been asked one specific question <e> <s> he claims there is a general power in civil aviation legislation <e> <s> what is the power <e> <s> the noble earl is representing the government in this house and is trying to reassure us that the power the house wants to write into this bill is unnecessary because it is already part of the legislation of this country <e> <s> the noble earl must therefore answer this question and in detail i hope <e> <s> what is in fact the position <e> <s> can he answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i asked a question earlier <e> <s> i have now in fact put the point made in a former speech which is to ask the noble earl to answer the question that i and others have put to him today namely can he now answer this question in precise detail <e> <s> the question is what is the effect of existing legislation on this particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he takes the view that if a restaurateur appropriates this money that is objectionable conduct <e> <s> is that his view or is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining the noble lord in thanking the noble baroness for repeating this answer may i ask her whether she is aware that many of us who favour an unequivocally clear no-strike agreement regarding gchq and have made that clear repeatedly find this a deeply depressing statement <e> <s> is she aware that many of us take the view that this is a further attack on the civil rights of a small number of officials who have done excellent work on behalf of the whole community <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that this can do nothing to improve the rather poor morale at gchq <e> <s> is she further aware that this long-running dispute will considerably damage the whole intelligence community in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> given the deplorable nature of this particular piece of propaganda relating as it did to the death of many millions of jew in concentration camps to the prevention of terrorism act and the dispute over gchq may i ask him whether the inner london eucation authority has now agreed to withdraw this teaching pack from schools pending the revisions which i understand are now being made to it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl or the department do not receive a reply very soon indeed from the inner london education authority can we take it that the secretary of state will make it clear that he expects this guide to be withdrawn forthwith and that if it is not he will consider what other steps to take <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that as well as putting the original document in the library he will also put the revised text into the library at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that some of us are rather puzzled by this episode <e> <s> as far as many of us are concerned there is no vacancy for this appointment given the fact that mr scott still holds this office and so far as any of us are aware has not been dismissed <e> <s> that being so may i ask her whether she is aware that mr scott is known by many of us as a person who treats people of different political parties with scrupulous fairness <e> <s> may i also ask her whether she is aware that many of us who have known him for a number of years know him to be a man of outstanding ability and integrity <e> <s> is she aware that there are most disturbing reports that the reason he is being forced out of this job is exclusively political <e> <s> in that situation is she not aware that many of us would regard such an outcome as deeply discreditable to those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that gratified though we are to learn that the tribunal exists the fact is as her noble friend pointed out that these people have been held in custody for five years <e> <s> is it not quite intolerable that this situation continues in circumstances where as the noble baroness recognises there is widespread concern in all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he is merely repeating a bland statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> he has given no clear indication as to why this has been delayed <e> <s> why has it been delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we welcome his remarks about the need to study the report very carefully before reaching final conclusions on at least some of the issues that it raises <e> <s> is the minister aware also that some of us are mildly surprised to hear him say so given that for the past week we have been reading reports in very nearly every national newspaper in which the recommendations of professor peacock and his colleagues have been rubbished in a most systematic fashion <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will do so <e> <s> it is very unusual to make public appointments on the basis that he is describing <e> <s> they are normally for a fixed period <e> <s> to take an illustration which is not particularly relevant to this area when people were appointed to the parole board they were appointed for a specific number of years <e> <s> if ministers therefter wanted to appoint someone for a longer period then they re-appointed the individual <e> <s> i find it very unusual to have this degree of uncertainty <e> <s> i do not want to press the noble lord today <e> <s> it is not a matter of critical importance but perhaps the noble lord will look into it between now and the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the judiciary was consulted before the change was made in the law <e> <s> given that there are expressions of disquiet as i understand it by members of the judiciary was the judiciary consulted <e> <s> secondly the noble lord talks about possible changes so far as local review committees are concerned and adding to their responsibility <e> <s> can he say whether additional resources will be made available for them if they are to be asked to do more work <e> <s> lastly taking up the point made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones does the noble lord agree that if we did not continue to apply the parole system as it now exists <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be very glad to give way if the noble viscount would like to speak <e> <s> as i understand it we are discussing a motion and the normal procedure is that the noble viscount having moved the motion will presumably respond to it at the end of the debate <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends i should like to say that we wish to associate ourselves with the remarks made by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of the local authorities have already passed resolutions confirming their previous decision <e> <s> in the light of this wholly totalitarian action by this group of local authorities is it not time that the government acted when it is clear that local authorities intend to continue to defy the law <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the object of the question is to give him and others the opportunity of saying firmly and unequivocally that they are opposed to political censorship in public libraries <e> <s> is he aware that although we welcome the fact that the department is apparently consulting legal advisers on the point this matter as my noble friend lord wigoder has indicated has been before the department for many months <e> <s> is he aware that we hope very much to have a statement before the summer recess on what the government propose to do <e> <s> in the context of the question put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the government either have powers in which case they should use them or they do not and if they do not they should seek parliamentary approval for those powers <e>", "<cs> i was surprised to hear the noble baroness lady macleod who was one of my colleagues on the parole board give some rather unusual statistics a few moments ago <e> <s> as i understood it she said that a -year sentence could become two years as a result of some decision by the parole board but of course that is entirely inconsistent with the present parole scheme <e> <s> there is no way in which the parole board could make such a recommendation <e>", "<cs> the committee can be assured then that that problem will not present itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him whether he is aware that many of us will be very gratified by the latter part of his answer <e> <s> is he aware that at a time when the government rightly are devoting a lot of time to crime prevention it seems very strange that there is no absolute obligation on shotgun owners to keep their weapons in a safe and secure place <e> <s> is he aware that this is giving a great deal of anxiety to the police in the light of the increasing number of offences where shotguns are used <e> <s> can he indicate when he hopes that this change will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome what the noble earl has said concerning the interests of passengers being foremost in the governments mind <e> <s> however is the minister aware that one of the reasons that the government lost the ryedale by-election was the anxiety of people in a rural area about what might happen to their services <e> <s> in the light of the humiliating defeat of the conservative candidate in last nights by-election in newcastle-under-lyme are we going to have less of this doctrinaire privatisation in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to associate ourselves with what has been said about the admirable work carried out by the emergency services by members of the railway staff by the fire service and the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that at this stage the noble lord the minister has said there is some form of constraint upon him to be brief <e> <s> however given the fact which the noble baroness <e> <s> lady david pointed out rather surprising all of us that this is a money bill and therefore the remaining stages of the bill will be taken immediately after the second reading a number of us hope that the minister will give full replies to these questions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he is aware that many of us regard this matter as even more urgent now given the position following the westland affair where classified documents were deliberately leaked by government departments and as a result of which no one was prosecuted <e> <s> does that not throw into strange light the decision to prosecute a junior civil servant who was sentenced to imprisonment for a trivial breach of this section of the act <e> <s> is the noble earl not aware that in the light of these events many of us regard section of the official secrets act as nothing more than an organized hyprocrisy <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak briefly on this question <e> <s> i do not intend to follow the noble lord lord broxbourne on the important question of whether this is or is not a wrecking amendment <e> <s> we have had that debate on previous occasions <e> <s> all i would do is follow the logic of the noble lord lord nugent when he invited the noble lord lord bruce of donington to answer the question as to what he believed would be the effect if <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that on the basis of what he has said this man as i understand it would have been released in six months in any event <e> <s> is he also aware that parole boards are constantly looking at the cases of dangerous and potentially dangerous men to consider how they should be released into the community <e> <s> it is a difficult decision and it would be wholly wrong for this house to draw any conclusions other than that the parole board does a difficult job in a highly responsible way <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak only briefly on this point and to develop a comment made by my noble friend lord diamond a few moments ago <e> <s> it would be wrong to oppose an experiment in this direction <e> <s> it is desirable to have constant experimentation in such areas and undoubtedly as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said there can be a degree of unnecessary bureaucracy in local government as elsewhere <e> <s> therefore it is worth looking at such proposals on their merits <e>", "<cs> i did and it is only fair to add the noble lord will not be surprised to hear me say this that it is unlikely any of the inner london authorities will be conservative with a large c for a substantial number of years if ever <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that not altogether satisfactory reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that what he said at the beginning of his reply certainly represents overwhelming opinion in your lordships house <e> <s> may i however ask two specific questions <e> <s> first on st july the noble lord told me that the minister was taking the first step in the formal exercise of his default powers under the public libraries and museums act <e> <s> he gave the local authorities until st september to reply <e> <s> what were the replies from the defaulting local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is no legal action being taken in the scottish courts <e> <s> i say this to reassure noble lords on my left <e> <s> that being so will he agree to discuss this matter with the secretary of state for scotland as a matter of urgency because it appears from the local government scotland act that the secretary of state for scotland has the power to take action against local authorities who behave with the degree of gross impropriety shown by a number of scottish local authorities <e> <s> in that situation when there is no question before the courts in scotland will the minister undertake to discuss this matter with the secretary of state for scotland as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that all these issues were argued out in and that by an overwhelming majority the people of this country decided to stay within the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say one or two words before the noble lord the minister speaks again <e> <s> i join with the noble lord lord barnett in what he said <e> <s> i have listened to the debate <e> <s> this is my maiden speech at this stage of the line-by-line discussion of the bill <e> <s> but i have heard a number of noble lords say that they believe there would be substantial advantage in getting this amendment carried <e> <s> what is the argument against it advanced by the noble lord <e> <s> it is that it is repetitious <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord that is not an argument <e> <s> it is a stylistic point at best <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that all of us wish to express our deep regret that police officers have been injured during the course of this dispute <e> <s> if he further aware that this vicious hooliganism has now continued for many months and is beginning to have a profound effect on the quality of policing throughout the metropolitan police district because of the call on resources <e> <s> does he agree that the sooner responsible trade union leaders cease to call for large-scale demonstrations at wapping the sooner the people of this city will have the quality of police protection that they deserve <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that all of us believe i hope in the right of people to picket in industrial disputes <e> <s> is he also aware that picketing should be by means of peaceful persuasion and that there is no relationship between what is going on at wapping and peaceful persuasion <e> <s> is he further aware that in future those who call for large-scale demonstrations as they are continuing to do must bear full responsibility for the risk of injury to police officers <e> <s> such injuries have already taken place as we heard today <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble baroness the fact that there is a <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to enter into the merits of this argument with which the noble viscount has been dealing will he look at the experience in when the standing committee procedure was used and the report stage of this bill took precisely two and a half hours after a three-day committee session <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question on a rather more detailed issue <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that i wrote to his honourable friend the minister of state regarding the concern of a number of business schools in this country about the impact that the introduction of the new visa requirements will have upon them <e> <s> is he aware that some of them are gravely concerned about this matter and all the more so because of the very substantial delays being experienced as regards posts abroad <e> <s> will the noble earl agree to ask his honourable friend whether this matter can be looked into with a degree of urgency because the consequences on some of the educational institutions in this country could be very serious indeed if some form of ameliorative action is not taken <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies to that point may i remind the noble lord who has just spoken that the minister answered specifically the questions which he has now repeated <e> <s> the fact is that over the falklands conflict we received an immense degree of support from our colleagues in the european community <e> <s> it was of enormous advantage to this country <e> <s> the noble lord is so ungracious as constantly to complain about the behaviour of our colleagues in europe <e> <s> in reality we had nothing but their wholehearted support <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> obviously there may be some trick of memory so far as i am concerned but my impression was that this document from which he is now quoting was one presented to the electorate by a labour government <e> <s> he is speaking from the labour front-bench <e> <s> do we take it that there is some new move so far as foreign policy is concerned or are they in fact dissociating themselves from every decision taken by a labour government in <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i share the view expressed by the noble baroness <e> <s> if the noble lord were to press the amendments we should undoubtedly vote against them <e> <s> i was surprised by the phrase used by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon when he referred to the danger of passing authority over i hope that i quote him accurately to foreign representatives sitting in a foreign capital <e> <s> that presumably is the authentic voice of international socialism as now defined <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble baroness for repeating the statement may i ask whether she is aware that we welcome the decision of the government to take action in respect of syria in relation to the communitys mediterranean financial protocols <e> <s> perhaps i may raise two specific questions <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that we very much hope that the next ministerial meeting with our community partners in london next month will be rather more satisfactory than the last <e> <s> is she aware in respect of our relationship with our colleagues in europe that there is some need to avoid self-righteousness in this matter <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that we hesitated for a very long time before we took action against the terrorists who were working from the libyan peoples bureau in st jamess square <e> <s> is she aware that the only reason we ultimately did so was because of the lamentable murder of woman police constable fletcher <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that a number of us raised the need for more vigorous action in respect of the libyans on a number of occasions and got precisely nowhere until that murder occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that inadvertently there was one point with which she did not deal namely the position of syrian arab airlines <e> <s> is she aware that as i understand the situation the syrians themselves have decided to suspend flights to london <e> <s> the question which i asked was this <e> <s> assuming that that decision is changed are we prepared to allow what is in fact an airline used for terrorist purposes throughout western europe to start flights again to london <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the noble earl lord longford for having raised this motion <e> <s> he initiated a similar debate in and it is valuable that we have the opportunity from time to time to discuss the work of the parole board and to thank the many members from the different disciplines for the admirable work they carry out as do the members of the local review committees <e> <s> this debate gives us an opportunity to discuss not only parole but some of its wider implications on criminal justice policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe obviously that every case should be considered on its merits which is why i was very critical of the approach made by mr brittan and i shall be coming on to that in a moment <e> <s> but just to deal with this point i consider at a time when this country has been exposed to a high level of terrorist violence the idea that the only consideration which the board should take into account is the likelihood of reoffending to be quite unacceptable <e> <s> i must make that absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that i was being given guidance of such subtlety that i was never able to understand it in which case we probably got very upset with one another <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not realise that the difference between these two cases is that the first cannot now be considered on its merits because of the new policy while the second can be <e> <s> what is the possible conceivable argument for the introduction of such a policy when such a clearly absurd situation arises <e>", "<cs> my lords let me begin with a point on which i think there will be universal agreement and that is to congratulate my noble friend lord bonham-carter on a maiden speech of rare quality and excellence <e> <s> i think he raised an issue of high public importance the interface between the ethnic minorities and the criminal justice system <e> <s> i hope given his expertise in this area that his words will he looked at extremely seriously by the home office and by the other departments involved <e>", "<cs> my lords there was indeed a hostage-taking situation which took place at peterhead <e> <s> what i am saying is that in the last year there have been a number of hostage-taking situations where people were threatened in prisons in england and wales <e> <s> they have not had the degree of publicity that there was in scotland because the persons concerned were not generally members of the prison service <e> <s> they were often other inmates although i think in one or two cases a member of the prison service was in fact involved <e>", "<cs> my lords who makes the final judgment in these matters <e> <s> is it the district auditor or who <e> <s> what is the policing authority <e> <s> is the noble lord implying that it is entirely a matter for the local authority to decide itself or is there some pressure brought upon the authority in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl when he expects to announce a decision on this matter <e> <s> may i also ask him whether he recalls the statement made by his predecessor that the government were looking urgently into the question of tightening up the provisions relating to the custody of firearms in peoples houses and in creating a requirement that people who have a licence should look after their shotguns <e> <s> may i also ask why after many months of being told by ministers that they are looking at this matter urgently there has still been no action <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a final question on this point <e> <s> is he aware that for many months the home office has been having discussions with shooting interests <e> <s> is he further aware that despite those discussions and despite the fact that they are now involved in a national crime prevention campaign the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some of us find it mildly surprising that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter regards the continued deterioration in the british balance of payments as good news in some way or another <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord one specific question <e> <s> while the government are not responsible for what appears in the newspapers does he agree that the series of statements in the serious financial press this morning indicating widespread disbelief in what has been presented as this remarkable improvement in our invisible earnings in this month makes it even more necessary for the government to have given a far more detailed explanation yesterday of why there was this massive apparent change in our fortunes <e> <s> although the government are not responsible for what appears in newspapers is he aware that many people who have to take a view on sterling read these newspapers and that therefore the negative speculation that has appeared in the press over the past hours could be seriously damaging to the interests of this country <e> <s> could that not have been avoided if the noble lords own department had been more careful about the way in which the figures were announced yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many of us are grateful to her for that profoundly satisfactory answer <e> <s> is she further aware that with regard to the position of miss mcgoldrick she is now being proceeded against by the local authority by way of some form of disciplinary action despite the fact that counsel for the local authority undertook to the master of the rolls that it would not dismiss her <e> <s> is she also aware of the case of mr gwyn powell head of a department at willesden college of technology who again is being proceeded against by the local authority and faces precisely the same charge as miss mcgoldrick <e> <s> is she aware that many of us regard this as no less than a shabby farce and the sooner the secretary of state takes vigorous action to deal with that abuse of power by a local authority the happier we shall all be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness undertake in respect of the case of mr powell which is causing widespread concern to ask her right honourable friend to do his best to ensure that a statement about this case is made before both houses rise for the christmas recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord mishcon in saying that the house will obviously approve of this order <e> <s> it is right to look from time to time at this question of disapplication <e> <s> i speak only because i was involved as minister when the rehabilitation of offenders act came forward as a private members bill in <e> <s> it is always

it satisfies no one else <e> <s> we all know why we have a separate electoral system in northern ireland and so does the noble lord <e> <s> we have it because of the serious public order situation that has arisen there <e> <s> the moral is therefore clear <e> <s> if there are widespread disturbances and substantial loss of life the government are prepared to devise an electoral system that ensures that the minority is represented but if there is civil tranquility in no way are they prepared to ensure that we have a fair electoral system <e> <s> as my noble friend lord gladwyn pointed out many members of the conservative party take a view strongly different from that of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount will find the noble earl lord caithness eager to reply to this point <e> <s> the fact is that it requires the support of the british government in the council of ministers if there is to be a change in the electoral system <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords why not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is obviously not aware that the labour government actually proposed a regional list system and ministers voted for it in the house of commons <e> <s> he appears not to understand what happened when this legislation came before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she is aware that the question put by my noble friend baroness robson was whether this money will be available on a continuing year on year basis <e> <s> she did not in fact answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that whoever may have started this dispute the level of violence both in wapping and in the surrounding streets has now reached an unacceptable level <e> <s> is he also aware that many hundreds of police officers have been injured in the course of this dispute and at the moment lorries carrying news international newspapers are being attacked on the highways <e> <s> i am sure the minister realises the seriousness of this situation and i should like to ask what is being done to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be commonly agreed that this debate has been valuable <e> <s> it was opened by my noble friend lord kilmarnock in a thoughtful and persuasive speech <e> <s> that has characterised the contributions made on both sides of the house <e> <s> i propose briefly to discuss three issues first the question of research secondly the problems caused by drug abusers and thirdly the resources available to the national health service a matter mentioned by the noble lord lord hunter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord going to deal with the other question which is this strange meeting with ministry of defence employees <e> <s> does he realise that if people think that the whole quality of their lives will be damaged and the value of their houses will be slashed they believe they have a right of free speech <e> <s> does he agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that while many of us welcome the fact that these discussions are taking place we hope very much that they will lead to agreement by the home office to establish such an institution <e> <s> is he aware for instance that the national association of senior probation officers and many others in the field of probation are firmly in favour of this <e> <s> is the noble earl further aware that at a time when the government are trying to promote the cause of non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment it is vitally important that the responsible service has a staff college like other home office services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is general agreement in the house that this has been a very worthwhile debate <e> <s> we all owe a debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for having initiated the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little time at my disposal <e> <s> with great respect the speaker

noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i agree in particular with his last sentence <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this huge and entirely irresponsible borrowing is in the case of a number of london borough councils continuing against the hope of a future labour government <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the labour party leadership i understand has made clear that it is not prepared to bail out these local authorities <e> <s> that being so is it not right for the government to consider any further action that can be taken in order to avoid the situation foreshadowed by the controller of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend section of the gaming act with respect to the hours for gaming <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord lord beaverbrook has just said and also for what the noble baroness said a few moments earlier <e> <s> i think this is a useful modest bill and i very much hope it will have the same uninterrupted passage as did the last bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may join with the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is clearly right as the home secretary has said for the government to pause for a substantial period of time before attempting to interfere with verdicts in the courts <e> <s> however i think that it is clear from the statement which has been made about all three cases that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> my noble friends and i would like to be associated unequivocally with the statement of the home secretary in support of the actions of the metropolitan police over a matter which the home secretary rightly describes as a disgraceful incident <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that first this prisoner was in an open prison secondly that there was no record of violent offences as far as he was concerned and thirdly that home leave is an absolutely critical factor in the preparation for an offender to return to the community <e> <s> is the minister aware that these are difficult questions of judgment which rightly should be left to the governor of each individual establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to welcome the fact that we are having this debate <e> <s> our enthusiasm for it is perhaps a little greater than that of the noble baroness who has just sat down and for perhaps rather predictable reasons <e> <s> i did not find the speech of the noble baroness lady cox antidemocratic <e> <s> that is a curious argument <e> <s> if we are to say that if we attack a local authority it is being antidemocratic what happens when we are attacking the elected government of the day <e> <s> it seems a strange argument at first sight but no doubt the noble lord lord underhill will come back to this point when he responds to the debate at the end of our proceedings today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord keeps on talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has boasted about two authorities brent and the ilea <e> <s> is he aware that in both areas the majority of citizens who voted voted against the labour party <e> <s> the only reason that a labour majority exists is the electoral system which he and some of his noble friends support <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton dealt with the point earlier <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill is making a totally false point <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the metropolitan police provide national services <e> <s> the local authorities we are talking about do not provide national services <e> <s> the noble lord is not comparing like with like <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a serious point <e> <s> the noble lord is speaking not only on behalf of the government but on behalf of the department of the environment <e> <s> it was his department which through the lips of its minister urged the chamber to reject the amendment <e> <s> if in fact that amendment had been carried this abuse of power in islington would not have occurred <e> <s> i asked the minister earlier and i repeat the question whether he was prepared on behalf of the department of the environment and not in terms of himself to offer its apologies to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of remands in custody is the noble earl aware that while in office the predecessor of the present home secretary mr brittan announced in an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that many of us are very gratified to hear his answer given that the first question this afternoon by one of his noble friends was read out at dictation speed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we welcome the conversion of the government to the cause of secret postal ballots with the ballot papers being sent to the homes of union members <e>

surprised that many unions have <e> <s> as he said retained very unsatisfactory workplace ballots <e> <s> does not the noble lord agree that it might have been slightly better if the government had accepted those amendments and thereby prevented the abuses which have taken place since then at many workplaces <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be gratified to learn that this will be one of the briefest speeches that i have made in the chamber given that we have over-run our time in a fairly spectacular manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble and learned lord and the noble earl in express <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount clear up one point that appears to be puzzling some of us <e> <s> who asked the director general of the securities services to conduct this inquiry <e> <s> did he do it as a result of a request from the prime minister or did he do it on his own account <e>", "<cs> i was wondering whether the minister was proposing to deal with the questions he was asked by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e>", "<cs> i should like to join in what was said by the noble lord lord holderness to whom i think i may refer as my noble friend during this debate because we spent so many agreeable weeks together on the select committee <e> <s> we found ourselves in general agreement <e> <s> i very much agree with what he has just said <e> <s> i do not regard the governments response on this matter as satisfactory <e> <s> the words close review are as the minister will be aware wholly devoid of meaning <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds i welcome what the noble lord has just said about local misunderstandings <e> <s> i recognise that they can occur <e> <s> however we are concerned about the future <e> <s> perhaps i may once again refer to the governments response to the recommendations of your lordships select committee <e> <s> referring specifically to the dover point one sees in paragraph of the report that in the view of the committee <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to be tiresome but i have put a specific point to the minister concerning the select committees recommendation relating to dover and to the very bland statement in the governments response <e> <s> i asked whether he is prepared to go further <e> <s> i believe it is reasonable that he should do so <e> <s> we are asking for remarkably little <e> <s> i recognise that another government department is involved <e> <s> will he agree to look at this matter between now and report stage and perhaps write to one or two members of the committee <e> <s> i believe that that is the least for which we should ask <e>", "<cs> we listened with care to what was said <e> <s> the point that the noble lord was making was that the criticism of the committee in so far as there was one was directed at the local authority <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> it was not directed at the people around waterloo <e>", "<cs> it is good to know that we have the governments sympathy <e> <s> but when i hear the word sympathy used in relation to an amendment i begin to hope that the proposer of the amendment will be as tiresome as possible which is what i hope the noble lord lord teviot will be <e> <s> that was a deeply disappointing reply <e> <s> the second phrase which was spine-chilling was the government are keeping an open mind <e> <s> we know what that means after our unfortunate experiences in the past <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to disagree with my noble friend who was the chairman of the committee <e> <s> however if he will read the governments response to our recommendation it does not give unqualified support to the recommendation of the committee and nor did the ministers speech <e> <s> if the minister said now that if an amendment were put down before report stage which made clear that it would relate to all trains going north of london if i may use that shorthand the government would accept it think he would reassure many of us and clear up this point <e>", "<cs> north of london <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is very fair <e> <s> many of us will welcome what the minister has said <e> <s> if he is prepared to look at the matter between now and report stage with regard to trains going north of london that will reassure many of us <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the motivations of the noble lord lord underhill are admirable <e> <s> however like my noble friend lord tordoff and the noble lord lord brougham and vaux i very much hope that the government will not accept the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend the committee chairman will agree we went into this most thoroughly <e> <s> i think that all of us were satisfied that the safety authority will look at the matter of segregation as compared with non-segregation with the utmost care <e> <s> i do not believe that the amendment is phrased in such a way that it would improve the situation <e>", "<cs> at first glance there are a number of perfectly reasonable features in the amendment though i am doubtful whether they should appear on the face of the bill <e> <s> these are matters for the intergovernmental commission and the safety authority <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill said that is one of the many reasons why membership of the authority has to be satisfactory to reassure the public <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord lord underhill not that i disagree in any way with what he has said <e> <s> i would specifically draw the ministers attention to page of the minutes of evidence <e> <s> not only is there the question of the kent fire service being represented on the safety authority one of her majestys inspectors of fire services is also an alternate member of the authority which i think is highly desirable <e> <s> on the other hand the minister will note the cross examination on page of the new chief inspector of fire services mr doyle <e> <s> this related to one very important safety question <e> <s> a serious incident occurred between manchester and yorkshire when a petrol train caught fire <e> <s> eighteen months after the request of the chief fire officers association to have a meeting at the home office on this question nothing had happened <e> <s> i hope that episodes of this kind do not take place again because they do not exactly enhance public confidence in the way in which our fire services are administered <e> <s> i make no criticism of the new chief inspector of fire services who has been in his post for a relatively short period <e> <s> it is however a disquieting episode <e> <s> the government produced a report on the matter and most of my colleagues were rather concerned when they read it <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will take that into account when he sends the letter to the noble lord lord underhill my noble friend lord tordoff and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there will be so many fires in the channel tunnel as to stifle anyone with bureaucracy <e> <s> it is a rather terrifying concept which the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls appears to be suggesting namely <e> <s> that there will be so many fires occurring that an alarming weight of work will descend upon the safety authority <e>", "<cs> my lords as the chairman of the select committee pointed out the committee were unanimously concerned about this matter <e> <s> he was also right in saying to the best of my recollection that we were not furnished with quite as much information as we have been given subsequently <e> <s> but the fact is that basically in all the evidence we received from local and other public authorities and other organisations north of london serious disquiet was expressed about customs and excise policy so far as these depots were concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be less than gracious if i did not begin by saying that i welcome what the noble lord has said about trying to arrange some form of dialogue between hm customs and the port authorities <e> <s> that is a sensible idea <e> <s> as the minister has rightly said it is contained in his letter to me of th july <e> <s> that is a step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of what the noble lord lord mulley said at the end of his short speech i assume that he will not press this amendment and that he is looking for some form of assurance from the minister <e> <s> were he to do so i very much hope that the house would not accept it <e> <s> i say this for two reasons <e> <s> first the noble lord lord mulley has had responsibility for nationalised industries and i have not unless one regards the metropolitan police as a nationalised industry which probably one would not <e> <s> i do not like the idea of giving a minister a power of this kind to certify whether british rail is or is not behaving sensibly <e> <s> it involves a degree of interventionism which i do not think is desirable in the day-to-day management of nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i would have beenand i suspect the chairman the noble lord lord holderness would agree with me more than mildly mortified if such an allegation had been made <e> <s> we spent many days listening to the evidence of various groups from around the waterloo area <e> <s> we recognise that there is genuine concern and without trying to make any partisan point we were all and i use fairly moderate language disappointed by the attitude of the two local authorities lambeth and southwark <e> <s> both had the opportunity to become involved with detailed discussions and both declined to do so <e> <s> both have been involved in a rather childish walkout from a meeting presided over by mr mitchell <e> <s> it does not help the inhabitants of the waterloo area when the elected representatives of the people behave in this fashion <e> <s> i very much hope that the two local authorities and the other local authorities which are involved will follow the unanimous recommendation of the select committee and now involve themselves without further delay in the detailed discussions which are necessary in order to minimize the inconvenience to the local community <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those involved in the discussion of these matters in standing committee i agree with what has been said so far <e> <s> first i welcome unreservedly an amendment which i think improves the bill substantially <e> <s> secondly like my noble friend lord tordoff i can see no argument whatever in the longer term for having green and red channels at waterloo <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly prepared to accept an apology from the government chief whip <e> <s> it is one of those happy occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misunderstood the second question <e> <s> it was whether as a result of this review and looking at this whole question again he would now undertake that there would be ministerial statements made on the outcome of that review <e> <s> that is the least the minister should offer to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer the house a few thoughts at this last stage of the bill <e> <s> first of all i should say that i began my work on this bill as a member of the select committee who was enthusiastically in favour of a channel tunnel but i believe that i and others on the committee who took a similar view listened to the evidence with minds as fair and open as possible <e> <s> i have no doubt that it is in the interests of the people of this country that the tunnel should exist <e> <s> i believe that it will act as an instrument of economic regeneration not only in the south east of england but in many parts of the north as well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ensure that the exchanges in the house today are drawn to the attention of the chairmen of british telecom and the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who contributed to this short debate <e> <s> so far as i am aware this is the first time that this house has discussed a substantive motion on the report of the commissioner <e> <s> i think it has been a very useful experience for all of those participating and i am grateful to all who have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that we shall obviously want to go into the question of police cells during our debate on the criminal justice bill <e> <s> there are a number of amendments down on that point <e> <s> is he further aware that many of us welcome the progress that has undoubtedly been made in the implementation of fresh start <e> <s> a great deal of progress has been made and that reflects well on the local branches of the poa and the home office officials who have been responsible for that <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that it is deeply depressing once again to hear about these wearisome disputes going on in a limited number of london prisons caused by the intolerable behaviour of a few poa branches <e> <s> is he aware that the only result of that is an attack on the civil rights of inmates because they do not receive the privileges to which they are entitled <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak very briefly <e> <s> i listened as i am sure we all did to the speech made by the noble lord lord irvine on second reading when he raised some of these questions <e> <s> notwithstanding the fact that i listened to that speech with i hope some care and attention i started off this debate as something of a neutralist on the issue <e> <s> however as the debate has proceeded i have become increasingly uneasy about what we are asking to be done <e>", "<cs> may i put just a very brief point to the minister <e> <s> let us suppose that a british subject goes on holiday to italy <e> <s> on his return to the united kingdom an allegation is made that he has committed a serious assault while on holiday <e> <s> he makes representations assuming we are going to get representations to the home office saying it was not me it was somebody else <e> <s> in that case who precisely makes the judgment <e> <s> here is a clear conflict of evidence <e> <s> an official will presumably either recommend acting in his role in reality as the bow street magistrate that he will accept the view of the italian authorities and their evidence or that of the british subject who vigorously denies the allegation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that our aims are entirely compatible <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything between us on that <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl for the purposes of clarification whether he could go just a little further <e> <s> as i understand it murder not being a federal crime in the united states as he is right in saying it is not save in the most special circumstances the federal government is in fact acting on behalf of the state attorney general <e> <s> would it not be possible as part of these arrangements to ask for an undertaking given on behalf of the state attorney general to the united states federal government that they would not move to execute a particular offender if he was extradited <e> <s> is that situation absolutely impossible <e> <s> i am sure that the matter has been considered in detail but it seems to be a reasonable request given our clear view in this country on the question of capital punishment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is right in saying that a certificate signed by the governor on his behalf would not necessarily bind his successor <e> <s> however it would undoubtedly have a substantial moral authority and i do not think that we should regard that as a matter of no account <e> <s> however the noble lord has made some interesting points and i hope that we have made some equally interesting points <e> <s> i hope that he will reflect on the matter between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> the minister has said that he will reflect on the matter between now and report <e> <s> given the fact that important issues are involved it would be helpful if he were to write to those who participated before report to give good notice of the result of his reflections <e>", "<cs> let me begin by saying that i very much accept that powerful advocates have spoken in favour of these amendments among them the noble and learned lord lord silkin the noble baroness lady faithfull who has had immense experience with regard to treatment of children and the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies <e> <s> it is also true that there has been widespread public concern about some recent cases in particular one highly publicised case at the central criminal court <e> <s> i do not doubt that there are many in this chamber and outside who would agree with the general approach of these amendments and in particular the first <e>", "<cs> what happens if through counsel he is then denied the right to cross-examine that child because the only defence he has is a direct attack on the evidence of the child who said that he committed the offence <e> <s> if we are to have video recorded interviews in future there has to be an absolute requirement that the child has to be available for examination at the trial otherwise i fear there is a real risk that in some cases there will be a grave miscarriage of justice <e>", "<cs> i share the views of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> if we are invited to increase maximum sentences i think we should have information of that sort <e> <s> i am sure the minister will supply it before the report stage <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will not be totally astonished to hear that that in the view of many of us was a profoundly unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> of course it is right to say that there is a fear among the general public concerning people who burgle their houses and people who steal <e> <s> that of course is true <e> <s> the question is not whether there is fear and justifiable fear but whether sentences as long as these which the noble earl argues are very rarely utilised should be kept on the statute book <e> <s> he says two things <e> <s> first in relation to theft the language he used if i took a correct note of it was that courts must have the option for longer sentences <e> <s> but what is inherently right about the existing -year and -year sentences respectively <e> <s> with great respect he has not argued that <e> <s> neither has he dealt with the points made by the noble and learned lord lord silkin <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble earl has convinced remarkably few people by the answers he has given this evening <e> <s> indeed were we to contrast the statements he has made with great sincerity on a number of previous occasions with statements made by his predecessor who also expressed deep regret and deep alarm we would see that three or four years later we are hearing exactly the same thing except that the or have become or <e> <s> where is it going to stop <e> <s> i accept of course that there have been problems in london <e> <s> i accept that immediately <e> <s> the new clause provides for precisely that situation <e> <s> i would never argue that the drafting of any new clause or any amendment is impeccable but it sets out a system whereby parliament would be invited annually to give its authority to what everybody now accepts is wholly undesirable <e> <s> that is what the minister says what mr whitton says and i am quite sure what the present home secretary says <e> <s> everyone accepts that it is unsatisfactory <e> <s> but are we going to do anything about it <e>", "<cs> i welcome that and no doubt the noble earl will be able to write and tell us the up-to-date situation <e> <s> certainly the situation i outlined obtained for a very long period of time and the figures i gave stated precisely the numbers of women involved <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord hunt has made clear that in any event it is not his intention to press this amendment today <e> <s> i believe that the question raised by the noble lord lord mishcon is entirely reasonable in terms of the general approach of the home office on the assumption that the carlisle committee makes a positive recommendation in favour of this broad approach <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has just said <e> <s> i doubt whether any proposal in regard to prisons in the immediate past has received more widespread support than the recommendations of the prior committee <e> <s> that having been said i imagine that mr <e> <s> prior must be feeling a little upset at the way in which his principal recommendations have been treated by the government <e> <s> i hope that mr carlisle will be rather more successful when he makes his recommendations <e> <s> if people are asked to study these matters carefully over many months and give up a great deal of time and effort in so doing it seems most unfortunate that their central recommendations are thrown out on the basis i am bound to say of a pretty flimsy argument <e>", "<cs> as courteous as i always try to be in this chamber i am nonetheless bound to say that that was one of the least persuasive arguments that i have heard delivered on behalf of the home office during this debate <e> <s> the noble earl told us that there was very little between us <e> <s> i rejoice to hear it <e> <s> however he went on to say that one of the reasons for his concern was that it might make magistrates less likely to impose a fine and might drive them towards imposing a sentence of imprisonment <e> <s> i wonder whether he consulted the magistrates association before he made that observation and whether he represents their views <e>", "<cs> no but as the noble earl was putting forward the argument that magistrates would be less likely to fine an offender and might be more likely to send him to prison i at least assumed that he had been in contact with the magistrates association before making such an observation <e> <s> apparently he has not been in contact with them <e> <s> i shall not press this amendment today <e> <s> quite bluntly i think that the argument he has put forward is most unimpressive and we will certainly look at it again <e>", "<cs> i think that by far the strongest argument of the noble earl is the question of the administrative difficulties which would arise given the scale of the problem <e> <s> he then went on to say as i understand it that he had a number of experimental projects under way <e> <s> given the administrative problems which he set out and which i to some degree acknowledge what is the character of these experimental projects which relate directly to the amendment which is being moved by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> if the noble earl is not in a position to answer that point tonight i should be perfectly content for him to deal with it when he writes to those who have contributed to this discussion between now and the report stage <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with what my noble friend lord wigoder has just said <e> <s> like him i much regret the decision taken by the committee earlier this week <e> <s> given the fact that that decision has been taken i do not begin to understand the argument for the single judge <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out it will undoubtedly lead to additional work for a hard-pressed judge in any event <e> <s> i do not believe that it will do other than add to the delay for a defendant who would know that the attorney-general was asking for his case to go to the court of appeal <e> <s> i think that the case if it is authorised as it has to be by the attorney-general <e>", "<cs> it is very rare for me to disagree with my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington but this appears to be one of those rare occasions when his judgment was at fault when he thought he was able to detect a gleam of hope from the features of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> if i may say so this sounds rather like a proposal to save of public money <e> <s> having listened to this debate i very much hope despite the lateness of the hour that the noble and learned lord will look at this argument again <e> <s> a substantial number of people would probably not make any demand on the scheme for the relatively small cost involved in damage to clothing <e> <s> but for persons of limited income as the noble lord lord morton of shuna has said old age pensioners who have very limited resources are this could be quite an important issue <e> <s> they not only have the shock of the attack for which in terms of injury they may receive some degree of compensation but they also have damage to a limited quantity of personal clothing <e> <s> it seems to me most unfortunate that as part of an arrangement whereby we are trying to put this whole scheme on a statutory basis this rather mean-minded approach has been adopted <e>", "<cs> i think that a number of us are going to have to read <e>", "<cs> i think the noble and learned lord will find when he looks at <e>", "<cs> i really hope that at some stage we shall get some guidance as to what is actually going to happen this evening <e> <s> i think it is a great pity that the noble lord lord morton of shuna has had to leave us given his expertise in this matter <e> <s> it seems to me rather unfortunate that we are being placed in a position where one person who has a very substantial expertise has now had to leave us <e> <s> also there is the fact that we are now discussing some very sensitive issues involving many people who are the victims of violence <e> <s> it does not seem to me that we are behaving in the most appropriate manner <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that we are going to adjourn soon and come back to this on monday <e>", "<cs> obviously i am not in a position to enter into any form of agreement at this moment <e> <s> i heard what the noble lord said <e> <s> we are told and the noble lord will confirm it that there is a tradition in this house that we do not sit late on thursday evenings but that is what we are now doing <e> <s> we have certainly gone through a very substantial number of amendments and nobody could possibly suggest that there has been any time-wasting <e> <s> i hope that we may reflect on this matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could be clear on this point <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has been good enough to say that he will reflect on a remarkably large number of issues between now and report stage <e> <s> presumably we shall have the benefit of those views through correspondence before report stage so that we can then consider ourselves whether it is appropriate for us to take any further action <e>", "<cs> if we have to consider whether we shall put amendments down before report stage it is obviously necessary to know whether the reflections of the noble and learned lord will lead to any action on the part of the government <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will look at this matter again <e> <s> i take his point that it is part of the present scheme <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> i know that because i am a director of a public company which had to consider exactly this issue where an employee was murdered and we had to consider what action to take to help the widow <e>", "<cs> may i raise one question which is not directly related to this amendment if i may reassure the noble and learned lord <e> <s> as the noble earl and the government chief whip are with us let me say this in terms of the future progress of the bill <e> <s> i have been asked by my noble friends to indicate that they have understood through the usual channels that there is to be some suggestion of a discussion of some kind in relation to the debates we had earlier in the committee stage dealing with extradition <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble and learned lord will listen i am sure he will to the points that have been made in this short debate not least by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> in a number of cases as he will be aware chief officers of police in england and wales and so far as i know in scotland as well have asked for the assistance of members of the public to help the police when they are involved in an episode of the kind which has been described <e> <s> i think it would cause widespread concern were they to believe that people who were injured as a result of attempting to assist the police were not to receive the degree of assistance which i think most of us believe they should receive <e>", "<cs> perhaps may ask the minister a question on that <e> <s> i apologise for not being able to give him notice of it <e> <s> is there no distinction in the statistics between burglary and aggravated burglary <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness moves this amendment i should like to point out that we on these benches were informed that the committee would rise after consideration of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on the basis of that information which we secured through the usual channels two of my noble friends went home <e> <s> i accept that it was done in good faith but i do not think that we should be given one account at one moment and a few moments later find that a totally different picture appears to emerge <e> <s> i hope that this topic can be started tomorrow <e> <s> we had a very clear indication from the government that they intended to leave the debate after we had considered amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> with great respect i am more than mildly surprised by that reply <e> <s> i am sure that the minister accepts that cost effectiveness as he said applies to the city as well as to everybody else <e> <s> it is highly doubtful whether a tiny service like the city of london probation service at the moment makes any sense whatever <e> <s> the noble viscount who raises this issue makes the very valid point that a number of special crimes such as fraud and forgery are particularly prevalent in the city <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> it is not an argument for a separate probation service for the city <e>", "<cs> the noble earl was right in saying that a number of valuable initiatives are being taken in the private sector <e> <s> long may this continue <e>", "<cs> given the increased level of heroin and cocaine importation into this country it is obvious that there will have to be strip searches in some cases and in other cases intimate body searches <e> <s> i do not think that any reasonable person can take any view other than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with everything which has been said by the noble marquess <e> <s> to some extent he has raised new issues in this debate because we have spent much time discussing how we should approach our own responsibilities as members of this house without considering the role of government <e> <s> i propose to deal with that issue during the course of my remarks <e>", "<cs> i always hesitate before disagreeing with a fellow member of the mcc but if i may say so to my noble friend lord wyatt surely sunday one-day games do not begin before pm am i wrong about that <e> <s> maybe i am <e>", "<cs> with great respect i think that this debate is not a particularly serious one <e> <s> we cannot start having an auction as to whether the number is five seven or nine <e> <s> i am not necessarily convinced that picking out racing and taking it up on its own is the right way to do it either <e> <s> i did not vote for the first amendment but i at least saw the logic of it <e> <s> i accept that there are legitimate anxieties on the part of people living near to sites where major <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends and i should like to associate ourselves with everything the minister and the noble lord lord cledwyn have said <e> <s> is the minister aware that many of us have in the past used harsh language to describe terrorist incidents in northern ireland but that it is extremely difficult to find adequate language to describe what happened yesterday <e> <s> it was an ultimate act of obscenity on a day of remembrance for those who have died to save the freedom of the people of britain and indeed the freedom of the people of ireland as well <e> <s> is the minister aware that we should also like to be associated with everything he said about the royal ulster constabulary and obviously the need as the noble lord lord cledwyn said to further improve security in the border areas and the degree of collaboration between the security authorities on both sides of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> he said a few moments ago that he was delighted to hear that the magistrate was going to make the decision and that this was absolutely right <e> <s> does he realise that the magistrate will not be making a decision on the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what evidence the noble lord lord moran possesses that this country has become a haven for foreign criminals <e> <s> having been a home office minister for five years no such facts were ever drawn to my attention at any ministerial meeting through the foreign office or through any other source <e> <s> i hope very much that we are going to make a decision about this very grave matter on the basis of evidence and not on the basis of fairly wild assertions of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords that is undoubtedly true and to the extent to which it is set out in the bill it is now explicit rather than implicit and that is an improvement <e> <s> in my view it is no substantial improvement <e> <s> it does not represent a major change in the position of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think when the noble baroness examines what i said she will find that the point she has made has no validity whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not seeking to reopen issues which were discussed on the previous amendment moved by the noble lord lord irvine this afternoon <e> <s> however as we shall obviously be coming back on third reading to what appears as amendment no <e> <s> and particularly to subsection m i and many of my colleagues would be grateful if before the next stage of the bill we could have a letter from the noble and learned lord dealing with the three specific questions i asked <e> <s> the first question concerns the home office and oral hearings when requested <e> <s> secondly there is the question of whether the secretary of state is prepared to set up a system whereby in appropriate cases he can appoint an adviser on a similar basis to that contained in the provisions of the prevention of terrorism act <e> <s> finally there is the question of compensation <e> <s> i am not asking for an immediate reply but i should be grateful for a reply before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it would be mildly surprising were the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones to be as speedily successful as that <e> <s> i believe that most of us recognise the problem which i know has been discussed before and i do not doubt that the home office has as on a number of previous occasions tried to do something about this and come up against this substantial obstacle of the division of powers between federal states and the united states government <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl moves the next amendment when is it the intention to rise for dinner <e> <s> we are about to start on a significant number of very important amendments dealing with videos and related matters <e> <s> i do not know the governments intention <e>", "<cs> my lords a few minutes ago the noble and learned lord lord hailsham of saint marylebone referred to the debate that we had in this house years ago on exactly this question <e> <s> i then as he rightly said <e> <s> defended a bill which contained a proposition of this kind <e> <s> it was not a question of an amendment being moved but of its being a proposal of the then government <e> <s> like the noble and learned lord lord hailsham i apologise to the noble and learned lord who is not able to be with us today but it is an open secret that the lord chancellors department at that time was far more enthusiastic about the proposition than was the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lord lord windlesham as a supporter of the next amendment which is in my name <e> <s> therefore i have found much of his speech persuasive certainly as far as the wholly unsatisfactory character of the present arrangements are concerned <e> <s> the house has now had the advantage of listening to one of my predecessors as chairman of the parole board and also my successor <e> <s> i do not quite know what the collective of parole board chairmen should be <e> <s> perhaps a cell would be the most appropriate <e> <s> i think that all three of us who have dealt with this matter over a number of years have come to the conclusion that the present arrangements are profoundly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords for a variety of reasons not least the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale i do not propose to press the matter today <e> <s> i wish to reflect upon what they said about the last three lines of the amendment <e> <s> i understand that there is a procedure under which i can tonight withdraw the last three lines of the amendment <e> <s> i am not sure that that is the most sensible way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i welcome the announcement which the noble earl made <e> <s> indeed it was not an announcement it was a re-repetition of the statement made by the home secretary the other day in relation to bail hostels <e> <s> i welcome that <e> <s> i remember that one of the first decisions i made in the home office was to increase the number of bail hostel places <e> <s> the then government inherited a difficult problem so far as bail hostels were concerned and acted fairly expeditiously in dealing with it <e> <s> certainly there is nothing between the present government and ourselves on that <e> <s> inevitably one can make the point that it could possibly have been done some substantial period of time ago nevertheless it is welcome and i do not in any way wish to diminish the importance of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if this power had been on the statute book i suspect that home office ministers would have found it possible to make rollstone camp a remand prison <e> <s> it would have taken them some time to achieve it but it would not have been as difficult as the noble earl suggests <e> <s> however he and i can continue that argument in the future <e> <s> we face the problem that the noble earls response is to deny the assertion that this amendment would concentrate the minds of home office ministers more thoroughly than would be the situation were it not to be passed <e>", "<cs> i propose to speak briefly to it <e> <s> it is essential for the record to point out when the government make a concession which has an effect on the prison population <e> <s> it is necessary to explain why we have now reached this degree of agreement <e> <s> i will be brief but i intend to make the case to explain why it is we attach great importance to this question <e> <s> these are important matters and it is right that they should form part of the permanent record <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl deal with one point <e> <s> i welcome the fact that he is not attracted by subsections and of the amendment which i think many of us would have found difficult to support <e> <s> i do not wholly understand why he is endorsing an approach which leads to this extraordinary increase from level to level in the last subsection of the amendment <e> <s> will he deal with that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason that i asked the question was that if there is a provision in existing legislation there is obviously no need for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with what the noble lord lord houghton has said <e> <s> we are very much in debt to the noble lord lord monson for having put down this amendment albeit in a slightly different form from one that appeared at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> parliament politicians journalists and many others have for a long time and indeed sometimes judges too had an over-relaxed attitude towards people who kill others while driving cars and even when they are sometimes very nearly insensibly drunk at the time that they do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that reply and thank the noble lord for it <e> <s> does the reply mean that the hospice will be able to take all patients it is planned to take <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect will money be made available to provide the full beds which the macclesfield health authority undertook to make available <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a point on this <e> <s> the noble earl is quite right <e> <s> the amendment was moved by his noble friend and very much to the surprise of a number of us the government accepted it <e> <s> it obviously has substantial implications for the inner london probation service and the city of london probation service <e> <s> since our last debate i have been approached in my capacity as president of the senior probation officers to ask for a clearer statement of the governments intention on this matter <e> <s> i shall not press the noble earl tonight but i should be grateful if he would send me a letter setting out in rather greater detail than he was able to undertake in committee the real reasons for the governments change of position on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the amendment <e> <s> i assume that the noble earl will be recommending the house not to accept it and if so he will certainly have our support <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am very worried about paragraph c of the amendment and the words for his own defence <e> <s> as chairman of the parole board i must have seen scores possibly hundreds of cases of unlawful wounding and grievous bodily harm by young men who had been convicted and sentenced to very substantial periods of imprisonment <e> <s> these were cases in which the parole board had to decide whether to recommend to the secretary of state that the men should be released <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl says that there is an objection in principle to what my noble friend has recommended he appears to ignore the fact that until the nottingham justices decision one could make such applications <e> <s> the second point which i would raise with him on the basis of his reply is that the implication of his remarks is that benches of magistrates would take exactly the same view on such applications <e> <s> but as we know from all our experience on the basis of decisions taken by different benches of magistrates there is absolutely no certainty that a second bench of magistrates hearing no doubt as is often the case about the intolerable conditions in which people have been kept while in custody and hearing the argument put on a subsequent occasion would not take the view that it would be right to grant bail <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down no the noble earl can with the leave of the house speak a second time and i hope he will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may suggest with the leave of the house that the noble lord lord monson should take note of what the noble earl has said and ought not to press this amendment tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat what he has just said <e> <s> the public address system is not working <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say in the presence of the noble viscount the leader of the house that the printed paper office appears to be experiencing a number of substantial problems at the moment <e> <s> i understand that apart from the problem identified by my noble friend lord tordoff we still do not have the latest print of the criminal justice bill and that there is no certainty that it will even be here tomorrow <e> <s> it may therefore arrive only <e>", "<cs> my lords i make just two brief points <e> <s> first the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has on two separate occasions this afternoon announced that one of the great victories won by this house is that as a result of the debates we have had a person who is facing the prospect of extradition will have the right to make representations <e> <s> the noble lord implied that that was not in the bill when first drafted indeed that is so <e> <s> he indicated that he thought that we had made major progress <e> <s> he has said it twice <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that we shall not leave the bill as it is <e> <s> i do not have the same suspicions as my noble friend lord grimond about the attitude of home office officials <e> <s> i think that they care as much about civil liberties as do members of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i recognise of course that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is not ministerially responsible for these matters <e> <s> on this occasion he is acting as a spokesman of the government rather than as the departmental minister <e> <s> nevertheless his reply i believe did not take fully into account as i had very much hoped it would the powerful speech made by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated i do not believe in having divisions for the sake of them <e> <s> i would have preferred the noble and learned lord to have gone further <e> <s> i understand his problem but given what he has just said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i agree very much with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i do not think that this proposal by the government will strike terror into the hearts of professional criminals in the way that the noble earl believes <e> <s> as we were saying on the last amendment there is a need to re-examine our attitude on this matter of the whole general question of life sentence policy but i do not believe that it is sensible simply to add more and more cases into this category <e> <s> i do not as i have indicated believe that it has the effect on professional criminals that the noble earl believes and as he knows that is also the view of the police federation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaverbrook cited germany as the single major exception <e> <s> is that right or are there other significant exceptions <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble lord lord wyatt has said <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beaverbrook will realise he has not been able to answer my question in the time available <e> <s> it has kindly been answered to some extent by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> however i should be grateful if between now and the next stage of the bill the noble lord will give me an answer to my question <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will look at this matter between now and report <e> <s> when the principal broadcasting organisations in this country express serious concern in a matter of this kind i think it only reasonable that the government should consider their position again before report <e> <s> there are clearly some major issues involved here which could seriously inhibit the quality of british broadcasting in the future <e> <s> that being so i very much hope that the noble lord will agree to look at this matter before report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> following the point made by the noble lord lord willis the noble lord lord beaverbrook was kind enough to say that he will look at the point <e> <s> perhaps he could send a letter i realise that he is going to have to send rather a large number in the next few weeks because i do not think the point is quite as narrow as he suggested <e> <s> there is a point of some significance here and we would all welcome a clear definition of the governments position in good time before the report stage <e>", "<cs> i too have received a letter from i suspect the same publication as the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> they have expressed concern about the matter and they have expressed deep concern as regards this particular amendment <e> <s> it would create intolerable problems for them <e>", "<cs> it may be that this is a radical amendment but on the other hand one has to accept as was said by the noble lord lord mulley that what we are talking about here is not individual acts of discrimination but a situation an environment which is damaging to the position of the independent local radio companies <e> <s> as the noble lord said originally there was a belief that if this attitude was adopted there would be more live music on independent radio <e> <s> that was one of the early reasons why there was a restriction on needle time <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord willis referred to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that over per cent <e> <s> of the grades concerned are now members of the prison governors association <e> <s> in the context of that situation can i ask him to ensure that the decision is made as speedily as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the general character of his remarks <e> <s> however is he aware that although it is obviously right to consult the other unions concerned it would be quite wrong to allow them a right of veto given the fact and i repeat this that over per cent <e> <s> of the grades concerned are now members of the prison governors association <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord now answer the question <e> <s> is the provision for cancer patients in this area adequate or not adequate in the view of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor aware that many of us in all parts of the house will be as <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that i very much welcome the fact that he will discuss this matter with his right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> but is he also aware as i am sure he is that the northern ireland secretary cannot himself prefer any charges or cause any charges to be preferred against any member of the royal ulster constabulary because he is the ultimate appellate authority in any such disciplinary proceedings <e> <s> as i understand it the only decision that could be made would be made by the deputy chief constable of the royal ulster constabulary <e> <s> i repeat that we welcome the fact that these matters will be discussed between the noble and learned lord and the secretary of state but at the same time we recognise that the secretary of state is not responsible for making a decision in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords following the comments of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones perhaps i may also thank the noble earl for having repeated the statement <e> <s> may i ask two questions <e> <s> first could he discuss with his noble friend the government chief whip the possibility of a debate in government time before the summer recess given that he has indicated that the white paper will be published in june a time when this house will inevitably have before it a very substantial amount of government legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask whether he is aware of the seriousness of the present situation in which a senior official of the united states government has publicly identified the channel islands as one of the major problem areas in regard to money laundering <e> <s> that being so can he indicate when the legislation in guernsey and jersey will be on the statute book as further delay will only play into the hands of the sophisticated criminals responsible for organising this industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the statement by a senior official of the drug enforcement administration in the united states about the problem in the channel islands was <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this another example of the governments excessive interest in secrecy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise one point following the remarks of the noble lord lord mcintosh with whose speech i very much agreed <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are many good private sector employers who do the best <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble lord lord gifford may i say at the outset that to put it as politely as possible he has slightly overstated the case when he makes a comparison between the exclusion orders under this act and the way in which political detainees are treated in the soviet union <e> <s> his case is not strengthened by overstatements of that nature <e> <s> i do not believe that that part of his contribution deserves a great deal of respect in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the minister to return to the circumstances of this case <e> <s> is he aware that this is one of the most shocking examples that we have seen of what happens to an individual prisoner convicted of no criminal offence in the most unsatisfactory situation in which hundreds of these men are being kept in small police cells every night of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recognise as i am sure he does the widespread concern about this matter in all parts of the house <e> <s> will he agree that there is also a great deal of public anxiety about the way in which sex and violence are dealt with by some tabloid newspapers <e> <s> at a time when he is trying to persuade the bbc and the iba about this matter will it be possible for ministers to discuss the subject with the proprietors of some national newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion at least perhaps the noble earl and i can agree that his first reaction to this matter would have been in accordance with what i have put before the house because we are discussing now one of the most extraordinary series of events certainly that i have seen in dealing with prisoners who are in home office custody <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl having identified that problem will join me in expecting an answer from the minister as to who made that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is being extremely helpful in going into detail <e> <s> he referred to the statement made by the coroner that the conditions in which the late mr flynn was kept at marylebone were barbaric <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the government whether given the criticism of the coroner they propose to continue to send prisoners in future to the police cells which were so described <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord trefgarne said there are three amendments and the amendment in the name of my noble friend lady seear and other of my noble friends is the second <e> <s> i think there is nothing between us on this issue <e> <s> as the minister rightly said it was dealt with in committee elsewhere when the minister indicated that he was broadly sympathetic to the principle proposed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to trouble the committee again but as the noble lord lord mccarthy was kind enough to refer also to the brevity of my speech and believes that that is some cause for complaint perhaps i may intervene and explain very briefly why i made a very short speech <e> <s> it seems to me remarkable that anyone can be against a proposition of this kind <e> <s> all that is being asked is that there should be an election address yet the noble lord lord mccarthy interpreted this as a devastating attack upon the trade union movement <e> <s> i do not begin to understand the logic of his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i wish to ask him two questions <e> <s> first is the minister aware that in the first few weeks of this year the number of robberies on the london underground increased by over per cent <e> <s> secondly what is the minister doing to enhance the establishment capacity of the railway police <e> <s> is he aware that many of us take the view that the present establishment is pitiably inadequate given the dangerous level of serious crime in london <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the problems on the london underground is that given the fact that there has been some degree of success so far as the metropolitan police are concerned in dealing with street crime in london there is now a fair amount of evidence that a number of criminals are using the underground system to carry out attacks on members of the travelling public <e> <s> in that situation does he consider it desirable to look again at the establishment of london transport police <e> <s> an establishment of officers not all of whom have been recruited seems to be a small number <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord deal with the very precise and detailed questions put to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say a few words about the bill <e> <s> one would have to be extremely unreasonable to say that there is anything inherently objectionable in the bill it is manifestly desirable and has the approval of us all <e> <s> one of the advantages that it has provided is to give the house the good fortune of hearing a former chancellor of the duchy speaking a few moments ago <e> <s> i have asked three previous holders of the office exactly what is done by the chancellor of the duchy <e> <s> i knew that he appointed magistrates but i was unclear as to his other responsibilities <e> <s> all noble lords now have the advantage of knowing precisely the powers of the chancellor of the duchy <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble earl lord ferrers on this point <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone says that airports are horrid places and no sane person would wish to go to one unless he was using a plane <e> <s> as we all know certainly from the experience of heathrow at the moment large numbers of members of the public go to airports <e> <s> that is fact <e> <s> i certainly believe that the noble earl is right in saying that were the licensing regulations to be wholly different at airports compared with the situation away from airports it would attract a significant number of people to airports <e> <s> with great respect to the noble lord i think he is mistaken on this point <e> <s> i believe that that would be the result were the bill to be amended in the way that the noble lord lord dean of beswick is suggesting <e>", "<cs> i will if i may say a few words on this amendment <e> <s> first of all i think it is extremely valuable that my noble friend lord falkland put it down because there has been an extremely interesting though brief debate <e> <s> i very much agree with some though with not all of the <e>", "<cs> i think a very important point has been raised namely it is clearly necessary for us to see the terms of the order before this bill leaves this chamber if we are being invited by the noble earl as we are to leave this matter entirely in the hands of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said about the position of -year olds <e> <s> i noted that the minister indicated that he believed as a result of the passage of the issue that we are discussing that there would be an improvement in the employment prospects of young people <e> <s> i wonder whether he is serious about that <e> <s> what is the evidence upon which he bases it <e> <s> i have heard no evidence to justify such a sweeping assertion <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing the noble lord make a serious effort to meet the anxieties which have been expressed on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord before he concludes his remarks whether he will agree that as has been put to him both by the opposition front bench and by my noble friend amendment no <e> <s> covers very nearly all the major issues of disquiet which have been expressed in the house <e> <s> will he further agree perhaps he will not that the amendment which he has tabled still gives cause for serious disquiet as far as many of us in the house are concerned as to whether it really addresses the issues which have previously been put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> i also join with him in saying that it must be one of the most remarkable statements made by a home secretary <e> <s> it is approximately nine months since the last series of emergency measures announced in the remission statement last july <e> <s> we are now faced with this series of proposals which have been introduced in order to deal with a situation in which the prison population is spiralling out of control <e> <s> that is the reality of the situation which we face <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble earl indicated a few moments ago that this is not a major problem <e> <s> his precise words were that it is not an enormous problem <e> <s> how many cases have there been <e> <s> it would be very helpful if he could answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by making a point that i believe will receive the endorsement of all in the chamber <e> <s> we have had two exceptionally interesting and stimulating maiden speeches today <e> <s> the first was by the noble and learned

am very surprised that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is satisfied <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether he will answer the specific question which i asked <e> <s> i shall repeat it <e> <s> are the government prepared to give any additional assistance to citizens advice bureaux in scotland as a result of the passage of this legislation <e> <s> yes or no <e>", "<cs> i wholeheartedly agree with the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> such disputes are undoubtedly some of the most difficult cases with which the police have to deal <e> <s> domestic violence of one kind or another creates immense problems for the police <e> <s> as we know they have substantial pressure upon their resources at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i was about to make exactly the same point <e> <s> i assume that the secretary of state will make a commencement order under these clauses only if the negotiations in brussels fail <e> <s> i assume that that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered the question that was put to him by my noble friend lord donaldson namely whether the government will give some indication in future as the noble lord has just done of their expectations so far as progress on the bill is concerned <e> <s> will the noble lord answer that specific question <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate of this character involving as it does the position of greenwich mean time i almost feel that i should declare an interest <e> <s> however given the fact that i am not a passionate adherent of gmt it is probably less necessary that i should do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that we very much welcome the review by sir robert andrew <e> <s> is he also aware that the civil service commission has drawn attention in the past few weeks to the fact that both in and in the crown prosecution service succeeded in recruiting fewer than half the number of people it then required <e> <s> is he further aware of the growing criticism of the crown prosecution service because of this chronic understaffing <e> <s> what urgent action does he intend to take to deal with this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am sure sir robert andrew will be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question i asked will the report be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the question asked by the noble lord lord mishcon which was specifically about the conditions at wandsworth prison <e>

noble earl has that information <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that clear and unequivocal statement by the minister as regards the scottish provision <e> <s> i am sure that there will be wild celebrations in barlinnie tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves to enjoy his weekend as we hope he will i should like to support what was said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i believe that there would be strong support among many senior police officers for such a committee <e> <s> i hope that the minister and his right honourable friend will consider the matter seriously <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will be good enough to reply to the specific points put to him by his noble friend lord rippon <e>", "<cs> with great respect i do not believe that the minister dealt very satisfactorily with the significant questions put to him by the noble lord <e> <s> however perhaps i may ask a second question with which i hope the minister will deal <e> <s> he mentioned the matter of referenda <e> <s> why is it right to have a referendum with regard to housing and wholly wrong to have a referendum with regard to this bill <e>", "<cs> with respect that is no reply <e> <s> the bill comes from the noble earls department <e> <s> how does he defend his approach to this amendment when the government are introducing a referendum as regards housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating the attorney-generals statement in which he described a situation which i think that all of us will recognise as being deplorable <e> <s> i should like to ask him two specific questions <e> <s> first will he confirm as i am quite sure he will that police officers from the united kingdom were in fact available to give evidence but that as he indicated on the advice of the irish authorities the crown prosecution service was told that such evidence would not be required <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble earl a question <e> <s> he appears to suggest that the government have behaved wrongly because they have given in to police pressure <e> <s> is it not right that the government should listen to the views of the police when armed crime is being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin on a point on which i am sure there will be common agreement that is that we have heard two very attractive maiden speeches today by the noble earls lord nelson and lord portsmouth <e> <s> i think that they were bold men indeed to try to make non-controversial speeches on the second reading of this particular bill <e> <s> if i may say so i think that they both acquitted themselves extremely well <e> <s> there was a strong difference between them in terms of the conclusions which they reached and i come down unhesitatingly on the side of the noble earl lord nelson who has the immense advantage of having been a serving police officer in this country and having seen the way in which armed criminals are prepared to use firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not <e> <s> i am referring to shotguns of both categories and not simply to sawn-off shotguns <e> <s> as i have indicated the confrontation normally takes place at a range of between one and yards in the kind of incident that i am describing <e> <s> if a shotgun is fired at that range the effect inevitably is a large hole in the body of the person who has been struck <e> <s> it can measure in many cases between two and six inches <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the minister will be aware that there is widespread concern in the police service especially among chief officers over the governments inability to find an adequate definition of armour-piercing ammunition <e> <s> i wonder whether he will meet my noble friend lord knights and i and perhaps some acpo representatives to discuss the matter to see whether we can make some progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to what the noble baroness said <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> the noble baroness used the phrase so long as they remain within the law <e> <s> what exactly does the noble lord think that that is supposed to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble baroness a question <e> <s> is she seriously suggesting that local government electors could make representations which the secretary of state will have to consider about a school in wolverhampton <e> <s> is that the effect <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just be clear about what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> although we are most reassured to hear what the right reverend prelate has said about the discussions he will have next wednesday the noble lords lord renton and lord boyd-carpenter raised this important matter with the noble baroness <e> <s> as many other substantial issues are being dealt with during the report stage of the bill will the noble baroness indicate whether the government will insist on having the third reading of the bill on tuesday of next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement and in saying that i think it is right to acknowledge that the statement was a great deal better than we had been led to expect <e> <s> perhaps i may ask a number of specific questions relating to it bearing in mind that one has obviously had very little opportunity of looking at the detailed provisions of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first thank the noble earl for having met me on the point on bail hostels about which he wrote to me <e> <s> this represents an improvement so far as this part of the bill is concerned <e> <s> but may i come back to the point about crisis at christmas <e> <s> as i understand it the noble earl has suggested discussions with local authorities on the point but i am bound to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl saying as he has just indicated on this narrow point that he will consider this matter and return to it at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones made an extremely powerful speech and it is not necessary for me to go into further detail as to why an amendment of this kind is clearly necessary <e> <s> he asked a series of questions to which we require the most clear answers from the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords one can pay rates by instalment at the moment <e> <s> that is no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to say a few words only about this order <e> <s> i do so in the context of the situation when i remember speaking in this house as a home office minister and we were dealing with legislation as regards great britain in the period of the then government <e> <s> i welcome the general thrust of this order <e> <s> i believe that it improves the position as regards working women <e> <s> i do not think any of us should have doubts about that <e> <s> it is also clear that the position of working women would not be improved if we were not members of the european community <e> <s> in this country there are constant complaints from some tabloid newspapers and some politicians directing criticism at our membership of the community <e> <s> if we were not members of it we would not be discussing this order today <e> <s> i believe it is necessary sometimes to say that with a degree of emphasis <e>", "<cs> i shall add only a few words <e> <s> i apologise at the outset for not having been present at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> that is why i have remained silent for a fairly significant time <e> <s> after the hungerford shootings the home secretary <e>", "<cs> no doubt one of the reasons why the government in this country are more cautious is that they have looked at what has happened in the united states and seen the appalling level of casualties affecting both the civilian population and the united states police service <e> <s> it would be astonishing were we to accept the argument that because in the united states there is no adequate federal legislation on firearms as a result of the power of the national rifle association we should therefore move to a similar position in this country <e> <s> that is totally unacceptable <e>", "<cs> at the moment there is no statutory obligation on the possessor of a shotgun licence to follow the advice of the police <e> <s> you would not put yourself at risk of losing your licence if you did not take proper steps to ensure the security of your weapon <e> <s> the noble viscount lord mountgarret referred to the position in north yorkshire <e> <s> i would suggest that the chief officer of police there regards it as a crime prevention measure so far as some of his officers are concerned <e> <s> personally i think it essential to ensure that people are put at risk of losing their licence if they do not take proper care of their weapon <e> <s> hope we shall hear from the noble earl that that is the position of the government <e> <s> i suspect that that is the case i very much hope that it will be confirmed <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord realise that if the owner of a car behaves irresponsibly he can lose his licence <e> <s> that is the issue <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble viscount has made that point because i was thinking of volunteering the same information <e> <s> having discussed the matter with the royal ulster <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord make it clear who is giving these estimates <e>", "<cs> a few moments ago the noble viscount lord brookeborough made a suggestion which i hope on reflection he will withdraw <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be wise to make this amendment and whether the noble viscount has considered the implications <e> <s> as i read it any criminal conviction would lead to the certificate being revoked <e> <s> that is the language of the amendment <e> <s> let us say for example that someone is convicted of the offence of shoplifting <e> <s> he has a licence <e> <s> is it suggested that automatically he loses his licence <e> <s> i cannot see any advantage in such a procedure <e> <s> it seems to me an act of gross injustice to the person concerned <e> <s> the noble viscount appears to be surprised <e> <s> but why should a person who after a blameless life is convicted of a single offence of shoplifting automatically lose his shotgun licence <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very strange proposition <e>", "<cs> before we continue perhaps i may just mention something <e> <s> can the noble earl or the leader of the house give us some indication of how late we shall be sitting tonight <e> <s> as i understand it the informal agreement was that we would have risen earlier namely an hour or so ago <e> <s> i may in fact be entirely misinformed <e> <s> but although it gives us all great delight to engage the noble earl and his colleagues in debate it is now pm and it would i think be reasonable to give some indication to the committee as to how long we shall continue <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the noble earl will be telling us in a moment that there are <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord burton advise which chief constables are alleged to be doing that <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that if a chief constable behaves unlawfully and the noble lord suggests that is being done the person affected can appeal to the courts <e>", "<cs> are we discussing amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive <e> <s> i thought that we were and no doubt someone will clear up that matter <e>", "<cs> i wish to follow up the speech of the noble earl <e> <s> i am bound to say that i did not find his contribution today quite as persuasive as i have on all previous occasions during this debate <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord monson i believe that it is going too far to say that this is an exercise in overkill <e> <s> it is in my view a very moderate response to an extremely serious situation <e> <s> as i indicated in the earlier debate it is the view of the police service virtually unanimously that the bill does not go far enough <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not making too much of this matter but as the noble lord lord swansea will realise this amendment was supposed to have been discussed in terms of the suggested grouping of amendments together with amendment nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i hope that in the remaining stages of this bill we shall be able to keep to the groupings otherwise this committee will sit extremely late tonight <e>", "<cs> one of the problems about the point made by the noble lord which at first sight appears reasonable is that he has not considered its full implications <e> <s> if you have a provision whereby any foreign citizen can come into this country and acquire a firearm and take it away from this country that man may well have a string of criminal convictions for acts of extreme violence <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that in such a situation very <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy for what the noble earl lord balfour is trying to do but i am bound to say that i do not think we could possibly accept this amendment partly for the reason which the noble lord lord swansea has given <e> <s> it is that in certain states of the united states there is no certification procedure because of the political power of the national rifle association <e> <s> therefore it would be extremely inequitable were one to pass an amendment framed in the form of the noble earls <e>", "<cs> a question of that sort is by its nature impossible to answer <e> <s> i am not a chief officer of police i do not have access to this type of information <e> <s> the point which i am making is that this bill has been introduced in order to strengthen controls over firearms and shotguns <e> <s> in a number of respects it does not go far enough <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer the point of the noble earl i am not a chief officer of police <e> <s> i do not have access to information on criminal records <e>", "<cs> please let me answer the point quite rightly too <e> <s> criminal records are confidential records kept by police forces <e> <s> i could not possibly be given information of that sort <e> <s> the police would not be carrying out their responsibility for the confidentiality of their own records <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> i answered the question by saying that it is the view of the association of chief police officers who probably know as much as the noble viscount or myself in terms of the merits of this argument <e>", "<cs> i have now made the point on three or four separate occasions <e> <s> it is just possible that the noble earl and i are not going to agree <e> <s> what i have told the committee is that the group of people whose views most people in this country would consider it appropriate to listen to with some degree of respect take the view that there is a serious omission in this bill as it applies to foreign visitors to this country <e> <s> they may be right they may be wrong but it is their view <e> <s> they have rather more detailed knowledge inevitably than any of us can have <e>", "<cs> the problem with amendment no <e> <s> is exactly the same as that relating to the amendment of the noble earl lord balfour <e> <s> in a number of countries one does not have to have what is described here as a <e>", "<cs> the noble lord gives a number of interesting illustrations of what various unnamed chief constables do <e> <s> all i am saying is that on the basis of the amendment moved by the noble viscount it would it seems to me be impossible for a visitor from some parts of the united states to <e>", "<cs> with great respect that does not deal with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think there is some confusion between myself and the noble viscount as we cannot hear one another too well <e> <s> neither of us is sufficiently close to a microphone <e> <s> all i am saying is that unfortunately the interpretation placed by the noble viscount on his amendment no <e> <s> does not appear in the amendment itself <e>", "<cs> the noble earl <e> <s> lord peel has reasonably pointed out the defect in his own amendment <e> <s> he says that the amendment that we have before us at the moment relates to the united kingdom <e> <s> he said that he wanted it to read great britain <e> <s> however the form of words before the committee at the moment is defective in any event <e>", "<cs> the amendment will surely profoundly liberalise arrangements in regard to northern ireland <e> <s> we must sometimes take account of the situation in northern ireland and not push it aside quite as easily as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl divides the committee what are the rules of the committee <e> <s> i say that simply because i do not know the answer <e> <s> i believe that the committee should be aware what we are voting for <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl will agree with me <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that it is virtually impossible for the police to take such action within a period of hours in every case <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers has said that in a number of cases it will be possible <e> <s> however if we make that an absolute obligation i must say to the noble earl that in my view there will be a number of cases where it will be impossible for a chief constable to discharge his responsibilities <e> <s> that is the position <e> <s> i believe that the noble earl lord ferrers is right <e>", "<cs> will the person in this country know enough about every person who is named on a certificate to meet such a responsibility <e> <s> i do not think that the noble earl is fully meeting the point which has been made by his noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> when i was chairman of the parole board i had to deal with large numbers of people <e>", "<cs> one begins to veer towards tedious repetition in some of the arguments tonight <e> <s> i apologise therefore for troubling the <e>", "<cs> on this happy occasion i find myself in total agreement with the noble viscount <e> <s> after many hours of debate it is something of a first that we find ourselves on the same side <e> <s> i believe that he is entirely right <e> <s> with great respect to the noble earl i am quite sure that the government considered the matter <e> <s> i regret to say that i believe that they came to entirely the wrong conclusion <e> <s> it does not seem sensible to maintain a provision of this kind in the bill <e> <s> i believe that everything the noble viscount has said is entirely right <e> <s> i do not know what he proposes to do particularly in the light of the point made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> however if he returns to the matter at report i shall he glad to sign the amendment with him <e>", "<cs> the only way in which to meet the noble lord lord monson would have been to recall parliament for the purpose of making a statement which would seem to me to be a considerable overreaction <e> <s> the noble lord lord swansea and the minister have put forward an absolutely convincing argument to the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said on second reading and as i hardly need to repeat i am wholly persuaded of the need for the bill <e> <s> but i indicated on second reading that i had some doubts about the compensation terms <e> <s> i realise that the noble earl will not be in a position to move this evening on this question because it is really a matter for the treasury rather than the home office <e> <s> but i hope that he will represent to the home secretary that there remains some disquiet on this question <e> <s> i very much hope that he will he able to come back with something rather better at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not entertain quite the same dark suspicions of the present home secretary as do some noble lords opposite <e> <s> i think that it will be his desire to have a reasonable balanced committee <e> <s> frankly if the committee is to have any position and acquire any kind of reputation it will only do so if it represents an honest gathering of the various specialist groups who have knowledge of the subject as well as some independent persons who do not have any involvement with the shooting interests the home office or the police <e>", "<cs> this is one of those rare occasions when i find i am not in agreement with the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i give him an example which will i hope indicate to him that what he said does not carry a great deal of weight <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends will certainly want to be associated with the remarks of the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> as the lord privy seal said this matter was raised by the noble lord lord windlesham during the third reading of the criminal justice bill <e> <s> a number of us supported his suggestion very firmly and i think it would be right on an occasion such as this to express our thanks to the noble lord and indeed to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who was involved in the debate on that occasion <e> <s> this is highly satisfactory and with the noble lord lord cledwyn we look forward to seeing the names of the members of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply perhaps i may welcome the fact that he is going to publish the views of the working party before moving to any form of legislative action <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to horrific scenes at football matches <e> <s> is he aware that much of the public disorder that takes place occurs outside football grounds <e> <s> is he further aware that introducing on a statutory basis some form of national membership scheme will not in any way prevent disorder in the streets around grounds but could drive a number of the smaller clubs out of existence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that there is deep concern about a situation in which it is said that over children at risk of sexual or physical abuse are not being supervised by social workers because of severe staff shortages in inner london <e> <s> that is the situation in some of the most deprived areas in this country <e> <s> what do the government propose to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that following the cleveland report it is a matter of serious concern that the answers he has given indicate an absence of any intention on the governments part to take immediate action <e> <s> is the noble earl further aware that some of us find it surprising that the government who on a number of occasions have been ready to intervene in the affairs of local government are not prepared to take some form of action on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to add something to the remarks made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> this matter was indeed raised in another place and i am glad that the government have produced these most important amendments <e> <s> normally i look with considerable suspicion at any provision added to the list of offences for which a person can be sent to prison for life <e> <s> however on this occasion it seems to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a number of observations on these amendments <e> <s> first of all i think it is perfectly right for the director of the serious fraud office if invited by the insular authorities in jersey guernsey and the isle of man to do his best to help them <e> <s> incidentally i should like to say to the noble earl i am sure he will be able to reassure me on this point that i assume we shall he repaid for this service by the jersey guernsey and isle of man authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in the case for instance of prisons where the prison service in this country harbours longer-sentence prisoners from guernsey jersey and the isle of man there is quite properly a repayment arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that genetic fingerprinting is an exceptionally important development in the investigation of major crime <e> <s> as the house will be aware it has been demonstrated in a number of major criminal cases in this country cases where if there had been an absence of evidence based on genetic fingerprinting there certainly would not have been a conviction <e> <s> there is no doubt about the importance of the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the bbc produces many helpful programmes such as crimewatch arid many others which are of immense advantage to the police service <e> <s> does he not agree that we live in a liberal democracy which means that the government of the day do not give instructions to the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at the outset that i believe this code to be a profound mistake <e> <s> it is undesirable because it represents yet another heavy-handed intervention in the affairs of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord can be reassured that various other matters are now being looked into <e> <s> he will not be altogether surprised to hear that apparently some councillors in westminster were not too enthusiastic about having too detailed an inquiry <e> <s> however i understand that continuing investigations are being carried out and i think that it is right that they should take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl must try not to be pompous when embarrassing political disclosures are made from his own department <e> <s> i was merely asking him to reconcile the approach disclosed in that memorandum and the action taken thereafter by his colleague mr waldegrave with the paragraph in the code which precludes local authorities from behaving in precisely the same manner <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mishcon i thank the noble earl for having explained the contents of this order <e> <s> like the noble lord i support it and my support for it is slightly more unreserved <e> <s> there are a number of issues arising from it that we should discuss this evening <e> <s> first i take up the point which the noble lord lord mishcon dealt with at the end of his speech <e> <s> i do not believe that either the present government or their predecessor can be accused of having moved with undue haste to introduce the tape recording of interviews with suspected persons <e>", "<cs> as i understand what the minister has said the service is up to establishment <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> perhaps before the next stage of the bill the noble earl will be good enough to answer the question i have just put namely whether the rent officer service is or is not up to establishment <e> <s> perhaps he will deal with that in writing <e>", "<cs> i rise to agree with much of what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said <e> <s> i am glad that the leader of the house is here because this problem extends well beyond the bill that we are discussing at the moment as the noble lord lord renton has pointed out <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble earl said and certainly i am aware as many are that a small number of local authorities have been extremely tiresome in that respect <e> <s> the noble earl is entirely right <e> <s> however i am slightly worried about the possible use of penalties in the future <e> <s> it is necessary to look at this matter in a balanced way <e> <s> many people seeking to buy houses in the private sector in london encounter substantial delays through the local authorities <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble earl will be cautious before moving further to impose penalties in one area of local authorities activities in housing and not in others <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to repeat arguments which have already been deployed but i very much agree with what the noble and learned lord lord hailsham said <e> <s> i do so in the context of the situation where my noble friends and i have voted consistently in this house in support of the position of special rights for disabled people <e> <s> i understand the immense problems that they have in getting through life but i do not believe that such an amendment makes any sense whatever especially for the reasons given by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the amendment is far too widely drawn and indeed it imposes a mandatory obligation on the chief officer of police which in my view is wholly undesirable in terms of the legislation now before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl will recall that those of us on this bench and the house generally have given the government and previous governments consistent support in their fight against terrorism in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with everything the noble lord lord mishcon said but i have a nasty feeling that as regards the law the noble lords lord campbell of alloway and lord renton are correct <e> <s> the effect of passing an amendment of this kind would be counterproductive <e> <s> i say that with some caution as i am not a lawyer myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a brief comment without coming to the point which was made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we are all in debt to the noble earl lord balfour for having raised this matter in committee <e> <s> this amendment is highly desirable and will increase that essential degree of confidence on the part of the public that we are doing our job properly and ensuring to a greater degree than was previously the position their safety <e> <s> i welcome the amendment without any reservation at all <e>", "<cs> i begin with an apology because by misfortune i was not here to listen to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> therefore i did not have the advantage of hearing the arguments he deployed in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i have some sympathy for the general thrust of what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> i was captivated by the suggestion of the noble lord lord renton that the home office is such a remarkable department he and i have both had the privilege of serving in it that it knows basically the answer to every single problem facing mankind <e> <s> that is possibly a marginal overstatement of the wisdom of the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the noble lord lord belstead is present <e> <s> he is the custodian of the rules of this house <e> <s> it appears to me quite clear that a number of the contributions which have been made in the past half-hour or so were wholly outside the recommendations of the procedure committee which have been accepted by the house <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble lord would say something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i express gratitude to the noble earl <e> <s> he received a deputation from my noble friend lord knights unhappily he is unwell and cannot be present and representatives of the association of chief police officers <e> <s> the deputation expressed the deepest concern about the clause as drafted <e> <s> we pointed out to the minister the real danger that foreign criminals could gain easy access to a substantial number of shotguns under the clause as then drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords this is probably the only occasion in the debate when i have agreed with the noble earls lord peel and lord portsmouth <e> <s> we are talking about law-abiding citizens

law-abiding citizens who have to get rid of their weapons should be adequately compensated <e> <s> at the moment i do not believe they are being adequately compensated and i very much hope that the noble earl lord ferrers will be able to meet us on this point <e> <s> i suspect that the hidden hand of the treasury is involved rather than that of the home office <e> <s> i nevertheless hope that the noble earl will be able to meet the anxieties of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we leave this matter to the home secretary <e> <s> i cannot see any advantage in passing an amendment of this character <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very largely with what the noble lord lord renton has said <e> <s> indeed i go further than he does <e> <s> i regard this as a wholly objectionable amendment and i oppose it as a matter of principle <e> <s> the amendment seeks to take over to some degree at least operational decisions which in my view are the clear prerogative of the chief officer of police <e> <s> the idea of a consultative committee albeit a committee which makes proposals which may be approved and have to be approved by the secretary of state making decisions of the kind which are specified in subsection a in my view is wholly wrong <e> <s> let us examine the expression in subsection a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the home office never gives a directive to a chief officer of police <e> <s> there are separate police forces in this country <e> <s> the home secretary has no constitutional right to give any form of directive to a chief officer of police <e> <s> that is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i agree with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i cannot see any case for an amendment of this kind <e> <s> there is a clear treasury rule which is operated by this government <e> <s> i know that because it was confirmed by the noble lord lord young of graffham in answer to a question i put on this precise matter <e> <s> it is that all fees for shotguns and all other fees charged by government departments have to be operated on a self-financing basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in total agreement with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> this is a most inappropriate moment to start such a discussion <e> <s> this is the third reading of the bill and we appear to be having another committee stage <e> <s> apart from that i confess that i have no sympathy whatever with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when he moved the motion that the bill do now pass the noble earl referred to this as a controversial bill <e> <s> it has certainly been controversial in this house and it was controversial in the house of commons <e> <s> a few moments later he reminded us what was the state of public opinion on the matter <e> <s> public opinion is quite clear <e> <s> it is solidly in favour of firm action in the aftermath of hungerford <e> <s> i ask those who have spoken this evening to consider what would have happened if in the aftermath of hungerford the home secretary had said that he proposed to take no action in terms of the law <e> <s> he would have been attacked on all sides for gross uncaring negligence <e> <s> in my view that is the reality <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will recall that we had two debates this summer on this question and on the relationship between remands in custody of mentally ill offenders and the overall situation as described by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> does he recall that he assured me subsequently that he was raising with the dhss certain matters concerning the question of mentally ill offenders kept in wholly unsatisfactory conditions in police cells <e> <s> what has been the result of his approach to the dhss <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether there will be an independent element in this research or is it being done exclusively by officials of the department <e>", "<cs> my lords so we can all be quite clear about what the noble earl is saying perhaps i may ask this <e> <s> as i understand it he is saying that there is an independent element and that being so presumably the results of this will be published and be publicly available <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords why not <e> <s> why should the results not become publicly available <e> <s> what is the secrecy as regards this <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the information will not be published <e> <s> however as the noble earl is also saying that there is no secrecy in the matter perhaps he can relate his observations directly to that apparent paradox <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i am following his remarks with close attention and i wonder why if our membership of the community is quite as damaging as he suggests the labour party has decided to abandon its policy of withdrawing from the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like by way of preface to make two remarks <e> <s> first i think that tonight we have had a typically engaging and robust speech which we all enjoyed from the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> it was a formidable piece of advocacy <e> <s> i agreed with a great deal of what he said although not in all respects <e> <s> i shall come to those points in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that nobody has challenged him on any of these points during the whole of the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to the points made by the noble lord we on these benches agree with this proposal and have no anxieties about the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones by agreeing with everything he said about the bill relating to the security services <e> <s> the government have dodged the central issue the question of parliamentary accountability is central <e> <s> i do not believe that the bill is in any way satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> he really cannot get away with that <e> <s> the fact is that under government pressure the chief constable has had to take officers away from his traffic divisions at a time when the number of road accidents in northern ireland is going to a very high level <e> <s> there has also been a scaling down of the crime prevention arrangements about which the noble earl has just been talking with such warmth <e> <s> why is it right to make these forced redeployments because that is what they are in northern ireland at such a time <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be general agreement that we have gained a great deal from the contributions of the noble and learned lords lord ackner and lord griffiths <e> <s> we were especially glad to see the noble and learned lord lord griffiths because we understood from his noble and learned friend that he was having a disagreeable visit to a dentist <e> <s> i can think of no more unattractive preliminary to a speech in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is generally agreed that we have debated today an issue of the highest public importance <e> <s> it relates to the freedom of broadcasters and broadcasters alone to report fairly and honestly the terrorist situation in northern ireland and the activities of their apologists both there and in the rest of the united kingdom and as the noble lord lord annan has just observed to cover the activities of a lawful political party <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble earl will come back to that point because he passed over it rather briskly in his speech and it seems to me central to the discussion we have had today <e>", "<cs> with great respect my lords that does not begin to answer the point that i have just made <e> <s> the noble earl should address himself to that issue <e> <s> in my view quite rightly the government have chosen not to try to ban the reporting of speeches made in either house of parliament <e> <s> the question remains why is the ban being directed at the european parliament and not at the house of commons or the house of lords <e> <s> the intervention of the noble earl if he will forgive me for saying so does not begin to answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords governments of different political persuasions including the noble earls own have turned down the ban which the government have now introduced <e> <s> what i said today is entirely consistent with the view shared by a substantial number of people with ministerial experience of terrorism and broadcasting <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement in this house is he aware that many of us have become increasingly concerned about the apparently never-ending disputes in a limited number of london prisons <e> <s> can the minister confirm that the consequence of those disputes has been to increase the number of prisoners being held in police cells in both london and elsewhere <e> <s> does he agree in the situation which he has outlined today that it is essential to give firm support to prison management because otherwise this continuing anarchy in a limited number of prisons will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the measure we are debating today is a public order bill <e> <s> curiously enough it is sponsored not by the home office but by a junior minister in the department of the environment <e> <s> its principal stated purpose is to reduce the amount of disorder in and around football grounds in england and wales <e> <s> its method as the noble earl lord caithness has told us is to establish a national membership scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the compliment of the noble lord but i must just put him right on this matter <e> <s> is he not aware that as a result of the introduction of closed-circuit television a substantial number of offenders have been arrested <e> <s> i am telling the noble lord now of the views of senior police officers responsible for operations at football grounds <e> <s> the noble lord really must accept that that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords just to be quite clear what the noble lord is telling us is he saying that english supporters going to wembley will have to be members of the scheme and that anyone living in scotland will not have to be a member of the scheme notwithstanding the fact that at the match last year twice as many scots were arrested as english supporters <e> <s> can he explain the logic of the governments position <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens if he shows his passport <e> <s> presumably if he shows his passport he has to be allowed into the ground notwithstanding the fact that he lives in manchester <e> <s> this bill is beginning to look more and more fatuous the more we discuss it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that there is clear evidence in the stated case that the safe-deposit centre was used to store cocaine and that it was also used by money launderers to store large sums of cash which were being laundered by the american drugs industry <e> <s> in the light of that fact is self-regulation really an answer to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that although we welcome any talks he may have with the british security industry association we should be a little more gratified if he would indicate that he would discuss the matter with the metropolitan police and other bodies such as the association of chief police officers <e> <s> serious questions are raised when safe-deposit centres are clearly being used by high calibre criminals to store the proceeds of their activities <e> <s> will the noble earl indicate that talks will take place with the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is the tenth occasion on which i have spoken in this house either on the second reading of a prevention of terrorism bill or on one of the continuance orders <e> <s> therefore i think one is faced with the real danger of becoming involved in tedious repetition of arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that although as he rightly says the numbers of regular police have increased in recent years it is truly astonishing that there are now fewer special constables than there were when the government came into office <e> <s> that being so what precisely do the government intend to do about it <e> <s> discussions with the chief constables are no doubt most admirable <e> <s> will the chief constables put their weight behind some form of national publicity campaign <e> <s> what specific measures are the government contemplating to deal with this disturbing shortfall in the recruitment of special constables <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that the numbers of special constables have been reduced significantly since the government came into office <e> <s> will he now answer specifically the question put to him by his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> what are the government intending to do <e> <s> the noble earl has said that it is a matter for chief constables <e> <s> is it not a matter for the government also <e> <s> does he not consider that he and his department should take some action to deal with what is an extremely disturbing situation <e>", "<cs> my lords after that extremely good-quality joke what would the ministers language have been if a left-wing labour authority had behaved in the way in which lady porter has behaved in westminister <e>", "<cs> i have one or two questions to ask on the basis of what the minister has just said <e> <s> the minister referred to the working party and the very distinguished members who served on it <e> <s> i have no doubt that the members were deeply distinguished but can the minister explain to me why none of the names of those members has been disclosed <e> <s> the working partys report published by the noble lords own department gives no names of the group of people who made the recommendation <e> <s> i find that one of the more surprising things about the report <e>", "<cs> i certainly support the amendment just moved by the noble lord <e> <s> as we heard from the noble lord the minister at second reading the government intend to exclude scotland from the provisions of this bill <e> <s> it therefore seems <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a quite interesting statement <e> <s> from whom did the government receive the advice that every club had to be included irrespective of the different problems or absence of problems associated with those clubs <e> <s> is he referring to the working party or to some totally different group of advisers <e> <s> we should all be immensely in the noble lords debt if he were to tell us why he is being so inflexible on the matter <e> <s> his argument in so far as i understand it is that the government have received this advice from an unknown source <e> <s> can he tell us the source <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has told us rightly that there can be trouble outside the first and second divisions <e> <s> that is true and no one has ever denied it <e> <s> according to the written answer given by his honourable friend mr moynihan in the other place i gave the <e>", "<cs> of course in some cases only a minority of those involved in disturbances are arrested <e> <s> that is the case if a large number of people are involved in substantial disturbances <e> <s> i am talking about very nearly non-existent disturbances at a number of football grounds <e> <s> in a ground such as aldershot which will be adequately policed by the chief constable of hampshire how can one say when the disturbances are on such a small scale that it would be impossible to effect arrests <e> <s> that is not a serious proposition <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord believes that that is evidence of immense enthusiasm for the bill among football supporters i would be rather surprised <e>", "<cs> in the cases which i have cited where the amount of crowd trouble is minimal <e>", "<cs> i think a number of us will want to read what the noble lord has said <e> <s> frankly i found it quite impossible to follow the argument which he deployed particularly in relation to the position of scottish football supporters <e> <s> that is not a totally irrelevant issue given the fact that at the last scotland versus england match at wembley twice as many scots were arrested by the police as english <e> <s> of course the scheme does not apply to scotland <e> <s> the government or the noble lord used the phrase that there were a number of unusual issues <e> <s> that is something of an understatement <e> <s> what he was really saying was that the government have not the faintest idea of how to bring international matches into their scheme <e>", "<cs> the more the noble lord says about the proposed fma the more concerned some of us become <e> <s> at the moment this is an entirely non-statutory body the scheme will not be presented for any form of parliamentary approval <e> <s> therefore there is no way in which the noble lord will be able to shuffle the responsibility for answering some of those questions onto a non-existent body namely the fma <e>", "<cs> is there any hope that the government will be able to clarify this matter between now and report <e> <s> i very much hope that the minister particularly after the contribution of the noble earl lord onslow will be able to tell us that we shall be given a far clearer indication of answers to questions that i and others have raised <e> <s> the minister will appreciate that those questions have not been answered <e> <s> if he is prepared to undertake to look again at this matter between now and report i hope that we shall not press the amendment because undoubtedly there are some difficulties involved although some of them are of the governments own making <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton feels the same way <e> <s> i hope that the minister will give some indication that he is prepared to look again at this matter because frankly in its present form the bill as drafted is most unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> may i ask one very brief question <e> <s> we have talked a great deal about the scots but some similar problems can be associated with northern ireland football supporters <e> <s> no doubt the minister will take that into account at the same time as he is considering the scottish issue <e>", "<cs> i indicated in advance that i was not going to press the matter whatever the noble lord lord hesketh said and therefore he will not be surprised that that is precisely what i propose to do <e> <s> however with the utmost possible respect to him i must say that i found it a little odd that he should ask what the point of all this was <e> <s> all these grave issues would have been debated in parliament and everyone would know exactly the position <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has made his position clear as indeed have i there is a whole series of unresolved questions which must be answered <e> <s> given the stance of the government at the moment i am not persuaded that such questions will be answered while the bill goes through parliament unless there is an absolute sea-change in the governments position <e> <s> that being so the scheme should be put before parliament for affirmative resolution <e> <s> as i said i have made my position clear on the issues of principle and we shall wait to see with some hope whether the government will reconsider the matter between now and the report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that was not what my noble friend lord wigoder asked <e> <s> he asked how a person is defined in respect of this matter <e> <s> does it include five six and seven-year olds <e> <s> we are entitled to a clear answer <e> <s> i shall be grateful if the minister will give us the benefit of his advice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put a practical problem to the minister <e> <s> a foreign visitor comes here from a country within the european community <e> <s> none of those countries has legislation remotely similar to that proposed in the bill <e> <s> he reads about a football match in the newspapers and decides to go to see it <e> <s> he queues up <e> <s> he is attempting to commit an offence under the bill <e> <s> he is committing a criminal offence which could cause him to be sent to prison <e> <s> does the minister suggest that that is a sensible way to proceed <e> <s> i shall be interested to know what precedents there are <e> <s> whatever the precedents may be i find that approach astonishing and beyond what is necessary to deal with the problems that the minister defined when he spoke on second reading <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will permit me to say with great respect that he is misunderstanding the criminal law of this country <e> <s> in my view there is little doubt that a person who carries out the act which the noble lord has described is attempting to enter the ground <e> <s> there can be little doubt about that <e> <s> there is little point in the noble lord saying that it is not an offence because as we all know statements by ministers cannot be taken into account in proceedings before the courts <e>", "<cs> some of us are rather intrigued on one particular issue <e> <s> i hope the minister will be able to help us on that <e> <s> he rightly said that the age of criminal responsibility is <e> <s> let us therefore assume that someone of the age of or attempts to commit the offence as dealt with in clause <e> <s> the only penalties referred to are a fine or imprisonment for a maximum period of one month <e> <s> but of course as the noble earl lord ferrers will confirm year-olds are not sent to prison in this country <e> <s> what happens to them <e>", "<cs> i should like an answer to my question on imprisonment <e>", "<cs> with great respect the minister has not totally taken the point <e> <s> what is the maximum sentence on a year-old the person who has passed the age of criminal responsibility <e> <s> what is the maximum penalty for such a person <e> <s> the bill states that the maximum sentence is one months imprisonment but year-olds cannot be sent to prison in this country <e> <s> that being so what is the governments intention on this matter <e> <s> that is a very clear question and i very much hope the minister will help us <e>", "<cs> so the noble lord is saying that if one of these nasty people as he has rightly described some of them many of whom are teenagers commits this thoroughly nasty offence he will not be sent to any form of incarceration <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be a bore to the noble lord lord hesketh but let me just put this point to him again so as to get his absolutely clear answer <e> <s> as i understand it at over the maximum sentence is one months imprisonment <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> the noble lord nods his head <e> <s> what is the maximum penalty for young men and women under the age of <e> <s> is it imprisonable or is it custodial which is the term i should use <e> <s> is it custodial in any circumstances <e> <s> if it is why is it not in the bill <e> <s> if it is not intended then given the governments general attitude i am mildly surprised that it is not <e>", "<cs> eighteen <e>", "<cs> from the age of to the age of the maximum penalty is a fine <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that there must be a deterrent <e> <s> he says that imprisonment is the only answer yet that as regards teenagers there is no custodial penalty despite the fact that a great deal of violence is committed by teenagers <e> <s> what is the sense of the governments position <e> <s> have they considered any of these issues before putting this ill-considered bill before parliament <e> <s> this is one the strangest debates that i have attended in the years that i have been a member of this house <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect the noble lord is not right <e> <s> i am sorry to bring in again the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> there is a range of custodial penalties for people under the age of as the noble earl will tell his noble friend if he bothers to consult him <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord takes some advice from the home office because with great respect i doubted in the first instance whether it was sensible for the department of the environment to be in charge of this bill <e> <s> everything that has happened so far has confirmed that view <e>", "<cs> i also find it difficult to understand what the government are trying to achieve <e> <s> it may be that i am being dense but i hope that that is not true <e> <s> in the explanatory memorandum we read <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend will take the same view of the matter as i we shall not press the amendment today but we shall want to see what the government suggest <e> <s> i welcome what the noble lord lord hesketh said <e> <s> i believe that it is far better to have a membership authority specified in the bill <e> <s> i believe that it is necessary to say what the maximum number of members should be because that is a normal statutory approach if i may so describe it <e> <s> i also hope that the authority will be required to publish an annual report which is an important matter and i hope that the noble lord lord hesketh will take that into account when he is considering with his officials what form of words to use in the amendments which he will bring forward <e>", "<cs> may i have an answer to the questions i asked particularly about the annual report <e> <s> i am not asking the noble lord to commit himself finally on the matter but i should be grateful if he could say that the matter will be looked into <e>", "<cs> yes but i assume that the noble lord was hoping to make more rapid progress and we will not have to move the amendment if he can give an indication now that he is prepared to move on the question <e>", "<cs> if there is to be an authority i would prefer the football industry if i may so describe it to be involved in the running of the scheme <e> <s> on balance i agree with the noble lord lord graham that there is a place for the spectators <e> <s> but there is a problem if the authority consists of people with economic interests <e> <s> i prefer to have a representative or representatives of the supporters or as i indicated earlier when the noble lord was perhaps not in the chamber an independent member <e> <s> i am slightly nervous about calling an organisation an authority when it represents exclusively the football clubs <e> <s> they are perfectly entitled to have clearly defined economic objectives which are not necessarily shared by supporters and the general public <e> <s> i would not want to make a final decision on the matter <e> <s> it is a difficult issue and i shall wait to see what the government do when they come forward with the new clause <e> <s> then we shall be able to see the matter rather more clearly than we can this evening <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that the secretary of state is to have a single advisory body rather than two <e> <s> that must make sense <e> <s> on the other hand i very much share the view of the noble lord lord dunleath <e> <s> the advisory council will play an effective part in discharging its responsibilities only if ministers pay decent regard to its recommendations <e> <s> i am not asking that every recommendation should be automatically accepted that is going far too far but if its views are consistently ignored there would be a substantial danger of a crisis of morale in the new body <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just a few words about the order <e> <s> i welcome it unreservedly <e> <s> it is altogether admirable that belfast still faced with a daunting security problem will soon have a development corporation doing extremely valuable work <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord blease i do not regard the london docklands development corporation as having such an unfortunate reputation as he has implied <e> <s> having seen the work of the corporation i very much hope that some of the best we have seen in docklands will be witnessed in belfast also <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak for the first time during this committee stage to say that i agree with everything that has been said during this short debate on this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question on that <e> <s> as the noble lord and the committee will recall the question i asked was this a member of the royal ulster constabulary hears an elected district councillor make a statement which is inconsistent with the statutory declaration that he has made <e> <s> he makes a positive statement of enthusiastic backing for terrorist outrages committed by the ira <e>", "<cs> i do not think that any of us are expecting the noble lord to give an absolute commitment this afternoon <e> <s> he will have to consult his right honourable friend <e> <s> however i very much hope that he will as a result of those discussions and particularly in the light of the speech of the noble lord lord colnbrook with his substantial experience of dealing with the terrorist situation in northern ireland come forward with a far more satisfactory form of words at the next stage <e> <s> if we can have any informal discussions in the meantime i for one would certainly welcome them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow up what the noble lord lord elton has said <e> <s> the minister has made an offer that he will reflect on the matter between now and report discuss it with the secretary of state and have informal discussions <e> <s> i very much hope that there will not be a vote this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i apologise for saying this a second time <e> <s> in my view it would be quite impossible for the committee to expect the minister to give the undertaking for which we are pressing him <e> <s> he would have to consult the secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> i agree with everything that the noble lord lord prys-davies said about the amendment having been hanging around for two or three months <e>", "<cs> i should like to help the noble lord lord lyell refresh his memory about what he said <e> <s> i understood him to say that he would agree to informal discussions between now and <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will now be good enough to say that my recollection is correct <e> <s> if he is prepared to say that i suspect that the noble lord lord prys-davies will withdraw his amendment <e> <s> it is very much in the interests of everyone <e> <s> there is no advantage in partisan voting on northern ireland issues <e> <s> we hope that the minister will rise and say that my recollection is correct and the matter can be disposed of <e>", "<cs> i very much share the view of the noble lord who has just spoken as i <e>", "<cs> there is much fear and distress as regards drug trafficking too <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl in his attitude to the terms of this amendment but i am bound to say that i agree with the substance of what the noble lord lord nathan said although i come to a different conclusion <e>", "<cs> the committee is indebted to the noble lord lord mishcon for raising the issue <e> <s> as i and others indicated at second reading the judgment of the european court is a matter of the highest importance <e> <s> i agree with everything the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i recognise the governments problems in coming to a decision <e> <s> there are some formidable difficulties <e> <s> we are in the unhappy position that we have either to accept or reject the bill <e> <s> at the very least i would hope that if the government cannot give an undertaking that the secretary of state will come to a decision on the matter before the bill leaves this chamber i suspect the answer to that question will be that he cannot the noble earl will be able to give an absolute and categoric assurance that before the summer recess the secretary of state will make a statement in parliament to make clear the governments decision on the matter <e> <s> that is the least we should ask for <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a few observations on this proposal <e> <s> a few moments ago the noble lord lord mishcon said that one of the arguments in favour of what he was then putting forward was that it would in some respects put the criminal law in england and wales and northern ireland on a similar basis <e> <s> but this clause does no such thing <e> <s> it operates only in relation to people who have been convicted of what are described as scheduled offences it does not apply to anyone else <e>", "<cs> yes but a terrorist convicted in england and wales is treated in precisely the same way as any other prisoner <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> we are not now discussing parole <e> <s> that was the subject of the previous amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we are talking about a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has now referred twice to violence <e> <s> i have the report in front of me <e> <s> the word is vehemence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that the debate this evening has been fairly unusual <e> <s> i can recall no occasion on which a television programme broadcast in this country has been subjected to an independent inquiry of the character of that presided over by the noble lord lord windlesham where programme-makers and others including senior civil servants have been required to give evidence or to answer questions as far as those from television were concerned about their motives and their conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords shall speak as briefly as possible because i suspect that the house would like to reach a conclusion on this matter <e> <s> i listened with great respect to the noble lord lord prior <e> <s> he said that he had considered the matter very carefully but had come to a conclusion which was contrary to that reached by his noble friend lord colnbrook <e> <s> he said a number of things with which i agree entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not predict that no one would use the legislation <e> <s> it may be that they will and it may be that they will not <e> <s> it would be foolish for me to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord prior made the point and i agree that it is extremely difficult to predict precisely what will happen <e> <s> all i am saying is that the risks involved in bringing the action will be very substantial <e>", "<cs> with great respect most members of the house will be aware of the very substantial difference between a person making a statement to the authorities which causes the attorney-general to take proceedings and being the plaintiff in the proceedings themselves <e> <s> they will have to go through the whole process of making application for legal aid with all the delays that will result giving the terrorist organisations longer to plan their response and more time to intimidate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question so that i am clear on this point <e> <s> an application is made that a councillor should be disqualified from a particular named local authority <e> <s> what is the position if he has residence in another part of northern ireland in an area with a different district council <e> <s> does the first disqualification bar him from all local government elections or only those to the named district council <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree with what the noble lord lord carlisle of bucklow has just said that both parliament and the home office will undoubtedly derive benefit from a debate on the issue in this house <e> <s> although debates are matters for the usual channels is the noble earl aware that we have been pressing for one through the government chief whip <e> <s> i hope that as a result we shall soon have some indication that we shall be able to debate the contents of an extremely important report <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak very briefly on this amendment <e> <s> on the last occasion i was not persuaded that the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon was right <e> <s> i did not like the idea of justices of the peace becoming involved in this process <e> <s> the noble lord has taken account of my concern and that of others by introducing the circuit judge which is a major improvement <e> <s> if the government are to act on <e>", "<cs> in the short speech that the noble lord has made i do not believe that there is much doubt as regards what members of the committee were voting on on the last occasion <e> <s> i am mildly mystified that anyone has any doubts concerning what we voted on <e> <s> i very much hope that an attempt will not be made through the processes of negotiation to negative the effect of the decision which the committee took on the last occasion <e> <s> i must warn the noble lord that we are extremely watchful and suspicious about what is going on <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all reassured about the intentions of the noble lord lord hesketh and i look forward to the outcome of the discussions <e> <s> i noted that the noble lord warmly welcomed what the noble and learned lord lord brightman said although what the noble and learned lord said was exactly the opposite of what the noble lord said during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord said at col of the <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e> <s> the noble lords words have only to be examined for one to recognise that there is a total contradiction in the position <e> <s> however there are to be discussions <e> <s> we wish them well but i repeat that we shall look carefully at the outcome to see that the government are not trying to negative a clear decision of this chamber <e>", "<cs> we all welcome the fact that the government have accepted the first of these amendments <e> <s> it is always wrong to be difficult in circumstances of this kind <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord hesketh found it necessary to make a few observations about the merits of the scheme i am sure he will not be surprised that it is necessary for some of us to comment on what he said <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn i wonder whether the minister can help us with the wembley stadium issue <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord graham i very much hope that the government will indicate that they are prepared to accept not necessarily this amendment but one with a similar approach <e>", "<cs> when we were last in committee on the bill the noble lord lord hesketh indicated the fact that he would introduce a substantial amendment dealing with the football membership authority <e> <s> we welcome that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord graham sits down i wonder whether the noble lord lord hesketh can assist us on the point about temporary cards <e> <s> we should much appreciate guidance from him on that matter because it is obviously of great importance to the football authorities <e>", "<cs> but of course the secretary of state and not the fma will decide the issue to use the words of the noble lord <e> <s> that is the point which concerns us <e> <s> there clearly have been a number of provisional decisions made within the noble lords department about what should be the essentials of this scheme <e> <s> no doubt the fma will be asked to look into those questions and make its recommendations <e> <s> however it will not decide the issue which were the words used by the noble lord <e> <s> his right honourable friend will make the decision and parliament is deliberately excluded from any rights in the matter thereafter <e> <s> that is why we are pressing the noble lord because if we do not press him today we shall have no other opportunity to do so <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> in responding to the speech of the noble lord lord hesketh my point was to question his use of the words decide and determine <e> <s> of course the football membership authority will decide nothing <e> <s> it will only decide to make a recommendation to the secretary of state <e> <s> that is what it will decide <e> <s> however thereafter it is entirely and exclusively a matter for the secretary of state <e> <s> parliament i repeat will have no further rights in this matter whatever <e> <s> i regard that as quite intolerable <e> <s> certainly i do not for a moment question the public spiritedness of people on the fma but at the moment we know very little about that body except that the government have indicated that they intend to bring forward an amendment on report <e> <s> that is why i press the government yet again to give a clear indication that they will publish those amendments in good time so that we can consult all those who will be affected <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will find that he has taken that statement slightly out of context indeed i would say more than slightly out of context <e> <s> the football authorities made it quite clear that they detest this bill <e> <s> they are referring to the situation which would arise if the bill receives approval by both houses of parliament which they have been pressed remorselessly to do by mr moynihan <e>", "<cs> i say in the most amiable spirit that the noble lord lord hesketh sounds rather like a junior minister in the immediate postwar labour government defending one of the more ill-judged and detailed economic regulations imposed by that government <e> <s> we are told that there must be no loopholes and that there are risks of the firm line <e>", "<cs> but why does it matter if the barn gate is open as the noble lord lord hesketh said if the people concerned are not involved in acts of violence <e> <s> i asked the noble lord whether he had information from the police or from some other body which indicated that there was a propensity so far as concerned these people to become involved in acts of violence <e> <s> the noble lord frankly replied that there is no evidence at all because the police have never felt it necessary to maintain records <e> <s> why have they not found it necessary <e> <s> it is because there is no relationship at all between these people and acts of violence <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put the noble lord lord mellish right <e> <s> he was kind enough to refer to me <e> <s> the statement he has made is entirely <e>", "<cs> the secretary of state will run football <e> <s> everyone concerned must accept the reality of that <e> <s> the football membership authority can make recommendations <e> <s> there will then be argument and discussion but in the final analysis football will not make the final determination <e> <s> it will be the secretary of state who will do that <e>", "<cs> until i heard the noble lord plod through that brief i had always assumed that he had a sense of humour <e> <s> however if he had he would have burst into hysterical laughter at the quality of his own argument <e> <s> i have rarely heard such nonsense from the government front bench on this or any other issue <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hesketh has made not the slightest effort to answer the point made by his noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> he did not even refer to the argument during his remarks <e> <s> i find that remarkable <e>", "<cs> how can it be a protection <e> <s> the noble lord must not use empty rhetoric without explaining what he means <e> <s> what form of protection is involved if an old age pensioner has to be a member of the scheme <e> <s> how are the interests of the old age pensioner improved <e> <s> that is the question that i should like to ask the noble lord <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would answer it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is simply repeating points that he has made earlier and which have singularly failed to convince a single noble lord in any other part of the chamber <e> <s> it has been pointed out to him by myself and others that the fact that one makes an old age pensioner join this scheme cannot possibly make him any safer because old age pensioners as a group do not riot at football matches <e> <s> the point could hardly be clearer <e> <s> yet every time we have this rhetoric from the noble lord without any justification for the stance that he is adopting <e>", "<cs> am i right in understanding that the government will make an exemption in this case and will present the house with a form of words <e> <s> the noble lord lord hesketh indicates that that is so <e>", "<cs> i ask the minister on what basis he says that that is the view of the police <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl will help us <e> <s> i asked him specifically to justify the statement he made about the police <e> <s> will he now do so <e>", "<cs> i asked a specific question of the noble earl lord arran about the attitude of the police <e> <s> he then answered a totally different question <e> <s> if the noble earl does not know the position then his advisers will and i now urge him to consult them <e> <s> i am asking him again in relation to the statement he made about the position of the police from whom did he hear this <e> <s> who told the government that that was the position of the police <e> <s> the noble earl made the statement he must now justify it <e> <s> will he please do so <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has now told us for the first time and only after being asked an embarrassing number of questions that he has received a letter from the association of chief police officers <e> <s> i think we are all extremely interested to know what the reservations are <e> <s> the noble earl has been good enough to inform us about the reservations of the police in regard to the bill which is a public order bill <e> <s> it is truly astonishing <e> <s> i repeat that if the matter had been handled by my former department even though we might well have had deep differences of opinion at least the department would have been able to answer simple questions of this nature <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for continuing on this matter but is that the only reservation introduced by the association of chief police officers <e> <s> going through the turnstiles is of course an important issue <e> <s> obviously if the system does not work there could be major public disorder <e> <s> will the noble earl tell me whether that is the only reservation made by the association of chief police officers or are there others <e> <s> i should be very grateful if he could help us <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble earl will be assisted by his noble friend in answering the question which some of us have put to him <e> <s> we have been discussing a question involving public order at football matches <e> <s> the noble earl has been good enough to indicate for the first time that he has in his possession a letter from the association of chief police officers <e> <s> he has now told us one of the reservations of that body <e> <s> i have asked him i hope a simple question <e> <s> are there other reservations and if so what are they <e>", "<cs> what exactly does that mean <e> <s> by whom will it be abused <e> <s> i do not understand what that means <e>", "<cs> i was going to develop a number of other points earlier but i thought it helpful to have the clarification which the noble earl has given us concerning a communication of some kind that he has received from the association of chief police officers which indicates concern on two issues only <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will be quick to correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> the first is an anxiety about what could happen at the turnstiles <e> <s> the second concerns abuse of the scheme by which is meant people illicitly entering a ground <e> <s> those are the only two concerns expressed by the association of chief police officers <e> <s> i put it to the noble earl that if i am wrong i look forward to him correcting me and i shall of course give way <e> <s> otherwise i shall continue with what i propose to say <e>", "<cs> once again the noble earl has declined to answer the question which i asked him <e> <s> i apologise for troubling the committee but when a minister consistently declines to answer a question one assumes that there may be some explanation for that <e> <s> he was the man who introduced the letter from the association of chief police officers <e> <s> it was the noble earl who referred to reservations being expressed by the police commanders of england and wales <e> <s> until he told us we were unaware of those reservations <e>", "<cs> this is disgraceful <e> <s> a minister of the crown has made a statement which he has been asked to justify <e> <s> will he do so or will he not <e>", "<cs> the gallantry of the noble earl is as always commendable <e> <s> however the committee has heard a statement made by the representative of the government about the attitude of the association of chief police officers <e> <s> he is the man who introduced the argument <e> <s> he is the man who said that there were anxieties in relation to two limited areas of policy <e> <s> i have asked him a simple question <e> <s> are those the only concerns or are there others <e>", "<cs> does that reply mean that a government amendment will be tabled on report <e> <s> i welcome the noble earls general approach but at the end of his speech i was entirely mystified as to what happens next <e> <s> what will happen next <e>", "<cs> the noble earl says commitment and i understand he is saying that school parties will be excluded from the membership scheme <e> <s> he then says that he does not want that to appear on the face of the bill and that maybe we shall have a mandatory exclusion <e>", "<cs> what does that mean <e> <s> the noble earl does not appear to understand his own brief <e> <s> i am asking him as courteously as possible to explain an answer to a relatively simple question <e> <s> if the noble lord lord graham withdraws his amendment as i am sure he will wish to do what will happen next <e> <s> will there be any provision in the bill dealing with the issue or will it be left entirely on the basis of the noble earls statement <e>", "<cs> as i understand it we are now quite clear and i hope that the noble earl will follow this question because i have perhaps been rather dense that the secretary of state will have no role in this matter whatever <e> <s> those were his words <e> <s> this will be a matter exclusively for the fma <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> that is a totally different answer <e> <s> the noble earl must do more homework on his briefs before he speaks to the committee <e> <s> he has now contradicted himself within the space of seconds <e> <s> he said that the secretary of state will have no role in the matter and it will be up to the fma <e> <s> when pressed he gave a totally different answer namely that he feels it is highly unlikely that the secretary of state will interfere <e> <s> the noble earl does his department no good at all by giving conflicting answers within the space of between and seconds <e> <s> i again ask him and i should be grateful if he will be good enough to confirm this whether his latest answer namely that the secretary of state could intervene is correct or do we go to his first answer in which he said that the secretary of state will have no role in the matter <e> <s> which of those answers does he wish us to take seriously <e>", "<cs> the reason why half the population would be excluded as the noble lord has said is that that half the population does not commit violent offences at football matches <e> <s> what the noble lord is once again saying is this <e> <s> so that we can have this beautiful bureaucratic piece of machinery which will hum in a most attractive fashion women are to be brought into it without any serious argument to justify their inclusion <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord not agree that the statement he made a few moments ago is even by the standards of our debates one of the most bizarre we have heard <e> <s> what the noble lord said on this amendment of the noble earl lord onslow was that his view would be exactly the same if there were no offences ever committed by women <e> <s> yet what follows from this bill <e> <s> they will be required to enter the scheme <e> <s> if they attempt to enter a football ground without being a member of the scheme they commit a serious criminal offence <e> <s> in the final analysis that could lead them to be sent to prison <e> <s> that is extraordinary <e>", "<cs> i have one question on that <e> <s> i asked a different question to which the noble lord inadvertently did not reply <e> <s> i asked him if he had asked the association of chief police officers whether it maintained detailed statistics of its impression of the number of women arrested for offences of violence at and around football grounds <e> <s> was that question asked or was it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome what the noble earl has said about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the government will accept this amendment <e> <s> i find it difficult to see on what basis they can resist it <e> <s> if we look at clause we see that there is a new statutory obligation imposed on candidates for a district council or for the assembly to make a statutory declaration <e> <s> clause the clause we are now debating deals with what happens if there is a breach by any district councillor or member of the assembly in the terms of that declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful experience in regard to this series of debates <e> <s> for the first time for a very long period indeed we have had the opportunity of discussing in detail a northern ireland bill rather than just a succession of orders <e> <s> i very much regret that in that situation the government were as determined as they were to ensure that not a sigle amendment was accepted despite the strong all-party support for a series of proposals which would in our judgment have made this a more effective piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> can i be clear on what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> perhaps he can confirm whether my analysis of his last statement is correct or otherwise <e> <s> we have a situation where a member of the scheme wants to take his own guest to a match <e> <s> as i understand what the noble lord lord hesketh said at its discretion the club can decide whether or not to allow that person into the ground as a guest of a member <e> <s> as regards the club the penalty will be if it lets in individuals who thereafter commit offences <e> <s> it will be exclusively at the discretion of <e>", "<cs> what is the object of the bill <e> <s> as i understand it it is to prevent hooliganism at football grounds <e> <s> upon what does the minister base his argument <e> <s> it is not now about violence at football grounds <e> <s> he is talking about the schemes integrity <e> <s> what does that mean <e> <s> as i said last week it seemed to me that the minister and his colleagues were so much in love with the bureaucratic procedures of the scheme that they had lost sight of their objectives <e>", "<cs> if we could be told what was in the letter i think we should all be interested <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon is entirely right <e> <s> the clubs have stated and the government have accepted that the effect of the bill overall is likely to be that there will be fewer casual spectators <e> <s> if the government resist the amendment the result will therefore be as a matter of elementary logic that fewer women will go to matches <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask one or two questions that arise from the ministers comments <e> <s> i welcome his statement that there will be some government amendments spelling out a number of the issues in greater detail <e> <s> no doubt we shall consider them at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers final statement <e> <s> perhaps i may take him back to the statement that he made a little earlier about a situation in which a policeman hears someone involved in uttering racist abuse but decides for various reasons not to arrest him <e> <s> the minister told us that the policeman concerned would go to a servant of the club i believe that that was how he described him and tell him that mr x mr y or whoever it might be had been involved in just such behaviour <e> <s> the club would then take action <e>", "<cs> with great respect if the noble lord reads what i said tomorrow morning he will find that my point is an altogether different one <e> <s> we accept that we are not talking about proceeding before a magistrates court or anything of that sort but about a situation these are the ministers words not mine in which a policeman hears someone shouting what he believes to be racist or obscene abuse <e> <s> he knows who he is <e> <s> no servant of the club hears it but the policeman does <e> <s> that situation will often arise when one considers the number of policemen who are on duty inside a football ground <e> <s> the policeman goes to a steward and says i have just heard that young man using racist abuse <e> <s> for various reasons i do not propose to arrest him but i am notifying you that that was what he was doing <e> <s> if the servant of the club did not hear that statement made he cannot possibly be a witness in any proceedings before the tribunal because the evidence is hearsay evidence <e> <s> that is automatically disqualified from consideration by any tribunal <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to persist with this point but there are many outside this chamber who will be concerned to know the precise position of the government <e> <s> i am asking for a clear undertaking from the minister i believe that i have it and he will no doubt confirm whether that is so that the police will in no circumstances be involved in having to give evidence before the tribunal <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord has said just that <e>", "<cs> i shall not persist with the matter <e> <s> however i suspect that the police service will be very anxious to receive a clearer undertaking than the noble lord has found it necessary to give on this matter of policemen giving evidence <e> <s> it is already concerned as the noble lord will be aware about the very heavy manpower resources that have to be made available at football matches <e> <s> if it discovers that some of its officers will be summoned to tribunals that concern will increase very considerably as i am sure the noble lord will recognise <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> does the minister make that statement on the basis of what he has been told by the football association or the football league or is it his judgment on the matter <e>", "<cs> i asked whether they had been consulted <e> <s> when the minister said that clubs would not wish to do this that and the other <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point but it depends on ones definition of regular attender <e> <s> does it mean one match in the season or four or five matches <e> <s> i understand the logic of the noble lords point when he says that if a person goes to every home game he should not be able to obtain entry on the basis of being a foreign passport holder <e> <s> however he may be a person who visits this country two or three times a year and wishes to attend a match <e> <s> as i understand it that would be a matter for the club <e>", "<cs> i have now twice asked the noble lord a direct question <e> <s> i hope that on the third occasion he will answer it <e> <s> did he consult the football association and the football league before he made the statement which he did this afternoon yes or no <e>", "<cs> i have now asked the question three times and on each occasion the noble lord has declined to answer <e> <s> he was the one who prayed in aid the attitude of the clubs to this position <e> <s> i simply asked him whether he had consulted the football association or the football league <e> <s> i assume that he has not <e> <s> if that is so why does he not simply say so <e>", "<cs> i have rarely had to ask a minister the same question four times and at the end of that not receive an intelligible reply <e> <s> the minister attempted to indicate that paragraph of the report answers my question <e> <s> as he well knows it does nothing of the sort <e> <s> i find it disturbing that he was not able to rise and justify the assertion which he made earlier <e> <s> we shall certainly return to this matter because having listened to the noble lord i believe that he has raised more questions than he has answered <e>", "<cs> the last sentence of the noble earls speech is if i may say so by far the most important in the statement which he has just <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that the minister would be able to assist me <e> <s> if he would prefer that i deal with the point on clause stand part i should be happy to do so <e>", "<cs> i am not clear on one matter that is the question of a hearing before a tribunal <e> <s> obviously the young man who may not have been convicted of a criminal offence will be very concerned to ensure that he does not become disqualified from the scheme <e> <s> it seems necessary to ensure that there is no question of the authority imposing any charge on a person whom it is considering disqualifying from the scheme <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord hesketh takes the point <e> <s> it seems to me that that would be an intolerable burden <e> <s> can the minister give any form of undertaking that there is no question of that being done <e> <s> if he can do so we shall be reassured <e> <s> we should be even more reassured if we had something on the face of the bill <e> <s> can the noble lord help us in the matter <e>", "<cs> it is always very good to hear compliments of that kind from the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> i was accused by the noble friend of the noble earl of being a home office chap or a home office fellow <e> <s> i do not regard that as one of the most deadly insults to which i have been subjected in my life <e>", "<cs> if that is the case as the noble lord suggests i wish to ask him one or two questions about what he has just said <e> <s> he will no doubt correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> the statement that football is going to run football is one of the favourites of the noble lord although we know it to be entirely false because the secretary of state will run football under this bill <e>", "<cs> i correctly summarised what the minister said in his first speech on this occasion <e> <s> i was subsequently followed by the noble lord lord harmer-nicholls who repeated what i had said <e> <s> it was that the minister would very much like to pass this responsibility over to the football association and the football league through the fma <e> <s> they have been told clearly and unmistakably that the football authorities refuse absolutely to take on this responsibility <e> <s> the reason has been given by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> why should they do the ministers dirty work for him <e> <s> why should they be in a position whereby they would be expelling one of their own clubs from the league <e> <s> that would be the effect of the withdrawal of a licence <e> <s> it is to me inconceivable that the football authorities would ever have taken on this role <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord did not answer this question <e> <s> i hope very much that he will do so now <e> <s> if the secretary of state is no to run a centralised system which he will have to do if the fma refuses to take it on there is only one circumstance in which he can escape from doing this job himself that is if he appoints another agency <e> <s> we are entitled to ask what thoughts the government have on this matter <e> <s> will they create yet another bureaucracy another group of public officials who will be asked to take on totally separate licensing responsibility <e> <s> is that their position <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister would help us on this point <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord hesketh can help us on one matter <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble earl lord onslow that we can return to this on clause <e> <s> but as he will see the last part of the explanatory memorandum deals with the financial effects of the bill <e> <s> the cost is put at million per year <e>", "<cs> we must go into a number of such questions with great care <e> <s> the minister referred to the right of an individual who may find himself before a tribunal of the authority to make representations <e> <s> however we are not dealing merely with representations <e> <s> we are dealing with an issue where there is an absolute denial of the facts as put forward by some club stewards for example <e> <s> the only way in which a tribunal would be able to make a judgment in such a case would be to hear evidence from all the parties involved <e> <s> it would be intolerable if in such conditions a fee had to be paid before an appeal could be heard <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that if we do not have the information by report stage we shall have it by third reading <e> <s> i believe that we should be most disinclined to allow the bill to leave this chamber with this important issue unresolved <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord hesketh appreciates that <e> <s> i welcome his statement that he has no objections to the principle of this amendment <e> <s> however he should also have no doubt about our expectations that is that there should be an explicit reference to this issue in the bill so that there can be no possible misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> i think that i understand some of what the noble lord lord hesketh has just said <e> <s> indeed i accept what he said about the police or a steward having the right to look at a card within the ground <e> <s> however i am not clear about this aspect <e> <s> if in fact the amendment moved by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton dealt with the situation both in terms of obtaining entry and in terms of requiring a person to show the card to the police within the ground does that meet his objections <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the ministers attention to clause which lays down <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> as i have said there is serious concern about this matter <e> <s> it is the view of many of those to whom i have referred that this is primarily a question for the fma <e> <s> the sheer pressure on police resources at present is substantial <e> <s> they do not want to find themselves being pushed into investigating offences of this character <e> <s> they take the view that it is a matter that the fma can take the major responsibility for pursuing <e> <s> the minister has said that he will consider the point and i hope that he will <e> <s> i can assure him that the police service is seriously concerned about this subject <e>", "<cs> i do indeed hope to be helpful <e> <s> i hope the minister will consider one rather bizarre element of the bill as currently drafted <e> <s> admittedly in a minority of cases and admittedly in relatively unusual cases a judge may wish to indicate his approach to a case before him by giving a man who has been convicted a nominal one days imprisonment <e> <s> the noble lord will recognise that in that case the man would be banned from entering any football ground for five years <e>", "<cs> that is fine so far as it goes <e> <s> however this is not just a question of terminology it is what precisely the governments objective is <e> <s> is the noble lord lord hesketh saying that he will simply choose a word rather than the word standard or is he telling us that he will use a different word because the different word will have a different meaning within the bill <e> <s> perhaps he can help us on that point <e>", "<cs> i assume that that means we can look forward to an amendment on this point at report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in welcoming the noble lord lord renton to our proceedings <e> <s> it may be years since the noble lord has been to a football match but that is not necessarily a reason for disqualification from our debates <e> <s> i say to him only that unfortunately he has not had the opportunity of being at some of our previous discussions <e> <s> if he had i suspect that he would have found it difficult to make the speech he has just made <e>", "<cs> with great respect if the noble lord follows the argument i am sure that he will be able to agree with me at the end that what i have said is factually accurate <e> <s> let us discuss the situation that we have already debated of international matches taking place at wembley <e> <s> that is exactly the issue that the noble lord has just mentioned namely england against scotland at wembley <e> <s> if the bill is not amended english supporters have to be members of the scheme scottish supporters do not have to be members of the scheme <e> <s> therefore if you are a scot travelling to wembley to watch the game between england and scotland there is no obligation on you to be a member of the scheme <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that that is the position <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord really believe that this great mass of football hooligans who are waiting to demonstrate at some football ground which is outside the scheme will get tickets for the cup final for example <e> <s> does he have any idea what he is talking about on this subject <e> <s> has he himself ever tried to get tickets for the cup final and experienced the substantial difficulties in getting them <e>", "<cs> strangely enough i am not <e> <s> i rise to say that that is without doubt the most unpersuasive speech i have heard from the noble earl since he became a minister in the home office <e> <s> we are talking about a major public order problem <e> <s> i do not know how detailed a discussion the noble earl has had with the association of chief police officers <e> <s> as he will recognise its members know a fair amount about the potential public order problem which will arise if when people are trying to enter manchester united football ground for example there is a major breakdown of the system <e>", "<cs> i am always prepared to admit that i am wrong <e> <s> i have yet to hear any member of the government admit in this debate that there is the remotest possibility of the government being very wrong on this piece of legislation <e> <s> i would never wish to be bad tempered with the noble earl <e> <s> he is far too agreeable an individual <e> <s> i had to say a few perhaps slightly harsh things about some of his colleagues only because they appeared at the time to be incapable of answering any of the questions addressed to them <e> <s> i believe that a certain level of competence is necessary for

of chief police <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is quite correct <e> <s> i am sure that there have been incidents of that kind at old trafford and elsewhere <e> <s> as a child i remember going to stamford bridge and being unable to get in <e> <s> there were significant numbers of people in the streets outside <e> <s> however there is no comparison between that situation where a relatively limited number of people found it impossible to gain entry to a ground and a situation where minutes before the beginning of a match many thousands of people are moving remorselessly towards the turnstiles and suddenly something goes wrong <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to press this amendment today <e> <s> i was more concerned to find out the governments position <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the police read about this proposal for the first time when the bill was published <e> <s> i do not want to labour the point but it is most unfortunate that that situation arose <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the

effect that people on bail should report to police stations <e> <s> it is not a totally dissimilar issue as the noble earl will recognise <e> <s> that caused problems for the police <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful <e> <s> perhaps i may speak on behalf of the noble lord lord knights and members of acpo <e> <s> they will be very glad to hear what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with one issue <e> <s> i am not asking the noble earl to deal with this point now i have not given him notice of it unless he chooses to reply to it in which case i shall be very glad to hear what he has to say <e>", "<cs> if that is what the bill is designed to achieve subsection and other subsections of this clause are not too felicitously drafted <e> <s> certainly i had assumed that a designated football match meant a match specifically designated by the secretary of state for that purpose <e> <s> as i understand it he will now designate a group of matches <e>", "<cs> i shall not press the noble earl <e> <s> if i had been going to make more of this point today i should have wanted to tell him in advance <e> <s> i have not done so <e> <s> i shall be grateful if he will consider the record of what i have said in the <e>", "<cs> the proposed amendment meets the position of a young man who may be in a different part of the country on holiday or for some other reason <e> <s> i may have been rather dense and missed what the noble earl said but i am not clear about the situation of a young man going with his parents on a family holiday to a country other than that where the designated football match is taking place <e> <s> what is the situation so far as he is concerned <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl is probably aware there is a relevant provision in the parole scheme <e> <s> if someone is on parole there is often a requirement in the licence that he notifies the parole board before he goes outside the united kingdom and receives the consent of the board <e> <s> that is not done in all cases but it is done in many <e> <s> obviously a parolee by definition has committed a far more substantial criminal offence than a young man in this category <e> <s> he has served a significant period of imprisonment otherwise he would not be liable to receive parole in the first place <e>", "<cs> the purpose which lies behind what the government are striving to do here is not in my view unreasonable although i am bound to say that i am extremely sceptical as to how many restriction orders would be enforced as a result of the acceptance of clause <e> <s> i say that for a very simple reason <e> <s> when british football supporters have misbehaved outside the united kingdom and have been arrested in the overwhelming majority of cases they have not been brought before the courts <e> <s> indeed they have been put on a train often under police guard and sent by boat-train back to this country <e> <s> that is what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin with an apology because i am afraid that i cannot be here at the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise to the house for that <e> <s> all that i can say in my own defence is that this is the first time that i have had to use that form of words since i have been in the house <e> <s> however so far as i am concerned it is unavoidable <e>", "<cs> my lords while i express no view on the merits of this bill i am bound to say that it is an extremely serious matter to which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has referred <e> <s> it seems to me that an attempt is being made to put pressure on witnesses before a committee of this house witnesses who in fact would be invited to give evidence on oath <e> <s> i very much hope that this matter will be looked at by the leader of the house and the lord chairman of committees <e> <s> i have not heard such an allegation made in the years that i have been a member of this house and i think that this should be looked into as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words on the amendment <e> <s> i was slightly surprised at the rather apocalyptic language used by the noble lord lord belstead about the consequences that would arise if the amendment were to be carried <e> <s> i directed my attention to the first three words of subsection b any confidential information <e> <s> for a relatively short period of my life i had a room in the foreign office next to the foreign office news department <e> <s> every day telegrams marked confidential sometimes they were marked secret were discussed quite naturally by officials in the foreign office news department and were in many cases thereafter disclosed to relatively small groups of carefully selected journalists <e> <s> i did not think that there was anything reprehensible about that <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i wish only to make a few observations particularly in relation to the american experience because i think it is desirable to look at the question as to how such matters are now handled by the central intelligence agency <e> <s> this organisation obviously carries within it far more secrets than are possessed by any british intelligence organisation <e> <s> i shall do so if i may by referring to one particular case that of a soviet defector called yuri nosenko <e> <s> he went over to the americans in <e> <s> he gave the cia a great deal of extremely valuable information <e> <s> subsequently however he was questioned about some possible link between lee harvey oswald the man who murdered president kennedy and the kgb <e> <s> later the then head of the counter-intelligence branch of the cia mr angleton acting on the basis of information which he had received from another defector mr golitsyn came to the conclusion that mr nosenko was a kgb plant <e> <s> then without the knowledge of the head of the cia he created a small prison for nosenko at a secret base outside washington <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would he be good enough to deal with the point i raised in relation to the central intelligence agency <e> <s> it was a point which i am afraid he has not dealt with in any way at all <e>", "<cs> without wishing to cross-examine the noble earl at length i should like to ask whether he realises that the procedures which have been introduced in the largest intelligence organisation in the free world are directly relevant to the issues which we have been debating this evening <e> <s> if the americans can do that without any grievous damage to their national security of the kind which the noble earl has been talking about how can he conceivably say that it is impossible for us to introduce similar procedures <e>", "<cs> i must say with great respect that the matter is still before the chamber <e> <s> the government chief whip has just come in and encouraged the noble earl lord ferrers to prevent his noble friend from withdrawing this amendment because the initiator of this proposal could not as it happened be here today <e> <s> that is most ungracious behaviour <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will not try to object to this amendment being withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a trifle difficult to follow part of the argument put by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls if he will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> my understanding of his view is that parliament is not the place to settle the question of whether or not wales should be included within this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to speak at length on the amendment <e> <s> i believe it only right to indicate that following the committee stage of the bill the noble lord lord knights and i and representatives of acpo met the noble earl lord ferrers to discuss a number of important matters dealt with in the bill which have direct relevance to the police service <e> <s> we are looking forward to hearing from the noble earl nearer to third reading about the outcome of the consideration which has been given to the points that we put forward on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government indicated that that was their position we would withdraw all the other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press this matter today <e> <s> the government have inched a little towards us <e> <s> we were asking for affirmative resolution and the noble lord has offered us a great deal less than that <e> <s> nevertheless he has offered us something <e> <s> i do not believe in being disagreeable about every passing gift horse <e> <s> i merely say if i understood the noble lord rightly that i am very concerned about the timetable <e> <s> he may wish to correct me at once if i am wrong but as i understood it he is looking for an absolutely complete scheme by the end of august from an organisation which does not yet exist <e>", "<cs> my lords big burly men such as the noble lord lord hesketh and i have started to become rather nervous at the speech of the noble lord lord renton in case we find ourselves imprisoned for one month <e> <s> to be absolutely blunt i cannot see the relevance of the speech of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> the fact that a large man goes to the entrance of a football ground apparently says nothing and thereby commits some criminal offence which could land him in prison for one month seems a little far fetched if the noble lord will forgive me saying so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> does he not realise i am sure that he does that if the man either enters the ground or remains on the premises he commits a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will give way <e> <s> does he realise that in such a situation the man concerned will have committed the offence of stealing a card and that would be an act of theft <e> <s> that would be the offence for which he would appear in court <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect under the standing orders of the house i am entitled to ask without the consent of the house a question on a point of clarification <e> <s> i ask the noble earl whether he will be kind enough to answer the question which i put to him relating to the stolen card <e> <s> if he cannot do that today i understand the position and no doubt he will deal with the matter in correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not wagging my face in any direction <e> <s> the noble earl has given as an answer the question that i put to him <e> <s> if he bothers to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> as i said i asked the representatives of the football authorities whether that was their position <e> <s> i was told by them that it was <e>

tribunal highly desirable that someone from outside football should be the chairman of that organisation <e> <s> if that is confirmed to be the position of the football authorities i rejoice to hear that the government would not try to block the proposal <e> <s> with that assurance from the noble lord unless <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect let us be quite clear <e> <s> i am the mover of the amendment and i have a right to reply <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham intervened after the speech of the noble lord lord hesketh <e> <s> under the standing orders of the house i am entitled to reply to the debate and i have every intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to deal with very nearly every amendment on page as the noble lord lord hesketh has done <e> <s> that would be something very close to an abuse of our procedures <e> <s> we must discuss the narrower issues which are before us <e> <s> i was a little surprised if i may say so that the noble lord used the rather unfortunate phrase about being sorry that the amendments had been put down again <e> <s> the reason that they have been put down again is the lamentable quality of the governments arguments against them on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of what the noble lord lord hylton asked perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is a matter of being pernickety if the noble baroness will forgive me <e> <s> we are discussing what will be incorporated into the bill <e> <s> if the requirements of the bill are not followed people will be committing serious criminal offences <e> <s> that is why we are being pernickety if that is regarded by the noble baroness as a term of abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no way in which we are not going to have a debate on old age pensioners <e> <s> let us make that absolutely clear <e> <s> what precise procedure should we follow <e> <s> in the final analysis i am perfectly content to have an ungrammatical bill because i do not think that it will make an immense amount of difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords could i be clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that there are to be special arrangements <e> <s> manifestly whatever the governments desire may be it is quite ridiculous for any serious minded person to believe that if for example bulgaria played england at wembley all the bulgarians would have to become members of this ridiculous organisation <e> <s> clearly therefore there will have to be special arrangements <e> <s> the only way in which one can determine a bulgarian from a citizen of any other country is by examination of his passport <e>", "<cs> my lords the football authorities say that they are very content and that if any old age pensioners want to be members of the scheme then they can apply to do so they can do so by the simple process of trying to join the fma <e> <s> indeed if the noble lord lord hesketh is to be believed they will be enthusiastic to do so <e> <s> i say that because the noble lord said that membership is not a burden <e> <s> therefore if he is right many old age pensioners will want to be members of the fma and that will diminish still further the likelihood of a queue outside those turnstiles <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord really need to say something as silly as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble lord lord hesketh might at least have replied to his noble friend lord mountgarret but apparently he does not choose to do so <e> <s> i commend him on the fact that he did not return to some of the more ill judged arguments made at committee stage <e> <s> the house did not hear anything more about chaos at the turnstiles for instance <e> <s> that was rather good news <e> <s> the argument did not sound too impressive on the last occasion <e> <s> it would sound even less impressive today after it has been pointed out that clubs have separate turnstiles for old age pensioners <e> <s> all we have heard are the merits of the totality of the scheme dealt with by the noble viscount lord mountgarret <e>", "<cs> my lords unhappily i did not have sent to me by the ministers department the letter received by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> fortunately the noble lord showed me the letter <e> <s> i very much hope that in future i shall also receive copies of letters particularly regarding matters on which i have spoken and on the issue dealt with by the minister of the council on tribunals <e> <s> i am glad to hear what the noble lord said concerning the reasons for disqualification <e> <s> that is absolutely essential <e> <s> it would be quite monstrous if the reverse were to be the case for example if membership were withdrawn from a member of the scheme without having an explanation given for that decision <e> <s> were that to be done i believe that the tribunal itself would face some difficult issues by way of a judicial review were such a policy adopted <e> <s> i am glad to hear that the government are thinking of certain moves in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton will do so <e> <s> however without in any way wishing to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder how much longer we shall be kept here tonight <e> <s> it is now pm and we have made substantial progress on the bill <e> <s> the government owe us some explanation as to how long we shall he asked to sit here <e>", "<cs> my lords just so that i am entirely clear as to what the noble earl has just told us i shall obviously look at <e>", "<cs> my lords in other words the gentleman in whitehall really does know best according to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> however i do not think in most cases the gentleman in whitehall knows best <e> <s> in a matter of this kind it is not a case of pure administrative detail at all <e> <s> it is a guarantee that a person who does not want personal information hawked around for commercial advantage should have the right for that information to be withheld <e> <s> in my view nothing could be more reasonable <e> <s> it has nothing to do with violence at football grounds but a great deal to do with the rights of privacy of the individual <e> <s> i therefore very much hope that on the basis of what the noble lord lord hesketh said on the last occasion we shall see some government amendment on the matter at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i always hesitate before crossing swords with the noble lord lord renton on a matter of this kind <e> <s> however i cannot for the life of me see the relevance of a football membership card to a police investigation into an act of theft <e> <s> there is no remote relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords if he is merely a witness there is no obligation on him to give an accurate name and address <e> <s> i do not say that it would be right and proper for him not to do so <e> <s> like the noble lord i should hope that he would co-operate in a police inquiry <e> <s> however in a criminal inquiry policemen cannot demand information in the way that he suggests if the person concerned is merely a witness <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome some of what the noble lord lord renton said and the fact that he felt it right i agree that it is to speak for the second time to the amendment <e> <s> i am sure that that will be noted by the noble earl lord ferrers who is concerned about members making more than one speech on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in thanking the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the statement <e> <s> is he aware that in this appalling tragedy all of us are grateful to the emergency services who did such magnificent work <e> <s> again i join the

grievously injured in this episode <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second occasion in the last two years on which the house has had the opportunity to discuss a report of the press council <e>", "<cs> my lords i said nominees of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the decision of the government to provide time for this important debate and i join with everybody else in thanking the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having agreed to introduce it <e> <s> like both of my noble friends i deeply regret that we have no member of the judiciary present today <e> <s> it seems quite astonishing with a debate of this importance and character that we find ourselves in that position <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question on that point <e> <s> as he rightly said we must not anticipate a decision by the courts <e> <s> however is he aware that the courts already have the power to disqualify people from attending football matches <e>", "<cs> my lords a week ago a detective sergeant of the south yorkshire police gave evidence to the inquiry in sheffield being conducted by lord justice taylor <e> <s> speaking about the scene at the liverpool end of the ground he said this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not the remotest intention of withdrawing his amendment particularly in the light of that very unpersuasive reply which did not answer a number of questions which i put to the noble lord lord hesketh <e> <s> i asked him at the beginning of my speech whether if a person wanted to confront his accuser and deny absolutely the charge made against him he would have that right <e> <s> he replied that there would be an oral hearing in an appropriate case <e> <s> but what is an appropriate case <e> <s> who is to determine that <e>", "<cs>

would have an immense amount to tell the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words about this group of amendments <e> <s> i did not have the opportunity of speaking on second reading

almost total confusion so far as concerns the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall use the form of words recommended by the noble earl lord ferrers and before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may ask him a question on what he has just said <e> <s> he appeared to suggest that noble lords who raised the question of an emergency situation were being extremely tiresome because we would not accept

follow the noble lord lord windlesham <e> <s> i must say that i totally agree with the contents of his speech <e> <s> i think that he and the rest of the house will agree that this has been one of the most interesting debates which we have had in the area of criminal justice policy for some years <e> <s> there has been substantial disagreement on one issue that is the question of the new statutory definition of murder as recommended by the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords that is extremely difficult to answer <e> <s> i am just putting as fairly as i can the evidence that was given to us by the home office <e> <s> i think it is a pity that it took the appointment of the select committee before we discovered this in the first place <e> <s> if it had not been for the appointment of this committee we should never have known what was going on <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not <e> <s> i indicated that that was my view of the matter <e> <s> i think that questions of this sort are a matter first for the home office and then for parliament to determine <e> <s> there was no decision by the committee on the issue <e> <s> i merely gave my own view of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway it always gives me immense pleasure to agree with him <e> <s> however i do not think that that paragraph deals with the specific question put to me by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> i indicated that my belief was that it would be better to have a judge helped by two assessors <e> <s> however it may well be that if the matter had been voted on by the committee the members might have taken a different view <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking why no black prisoners were used as orderlies <e> <s> the inspector pointed out that there were such jobs <e> <s> in a prison where per cent <e> <s> of the inmates are black there was not one black face in that group of orderlies <e> <s> is that question also being addressed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that many noble lords share his view that it is desirable to speed up these processes when possible <e> <s> will he bear in mind that people in the area concerned also have rights <e> <s> does he agree that in terms of the city airport and some of the other developments there is a real risk of environmental damage to the people in the area concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us would agree with him that we should not be backward looking in this matter <e> <s> however will he now answer the question put to him by the noble baroness lady jeger as to why there cannot be backdating when the money is eventually paid in april next year <e> <s> will he answer that specific point <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome this bill unreservedly <e> <s> both conventions which the bill will enable us to ratify are of central importance in the battle against international crime and in particular against the sophisticated criminals involved in the illicit narcotics industry <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to express a view on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon until i have heard what the noble earl lord ferrers has to say <e> <s> we wish this bill to be as rigorous as possible because of the scale of money-laundering that is now taking place <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for the letter which i received earlier this afternoon dealing with a point of some importance <e> <s> as far as i am concerned he has dealt with the matter satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly prepared to deal with the matter in that way but the speech i am about to make will be brief and there would be no purpose in repeating it later <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may continue <e> <s> an associate bank the bank of credit and commerce international overseas pleaded guilty to another charges <e> <s> those two banks agreed to pay a fine of million dollars which is the largest fine that has ever been imposed in such cases by a court in the united states <e>", "<cs> i certainly have no objection to the government consulting the bankers <e> <s> however i hope that at the same time they will also consult other people <e> <s> we are concerned about the public interest in this matter not the interests of just the banking community <e> <s> we are faced with a major criminal problem that is the quantity of illicit money raised by people involved in the drugs industry on both sides of the atlantic <e> <s> if this power will strengthen our position in terms of dealing with the matter then i think we should give it to the government <e>", "<cs> i thought that that was so <e>", "<cs> i take it that the provision referring to the channel islands and the isle of man means that there will not have to be any legislation passed by the legislatures of the isle of man jersey and guernsey <e> <s> i assume that it will be done at the instance of the british government without the need for legislation in each of those three territories because as the noble earl will be aware problems have arisen in the past as a result of rather slow progress in those legislatures on the drug trafficking offences legislation which we have been discussing this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it always gives me great pleasure to follow my old boss in any debate in this house but particularly on this occasion because the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has made a particularly thoughtful speech with the contents of which i agree without reservation <e> <s> like him i welcome the fact that the noble earl put down this unstarred question although the debate is taking place only a relatively short period before the government publish their white paper on criminal justice policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the evidence was ambiguous as it always is when one looks at criminal justice statistics <e> <s> i am sure that we all accept that many thousands of people have been diverted from custody as a result of community service <e> <s> there is no doubt that without it the prison system might well have faced the breakdown which so many people have anticipated during the last decade <e> <s> so much for community service <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble earl for having repeated the statement <e> <s> i do not believe that any junior minister has had a more extraordinary statement to make to this house since i have been a member of it <e> <s> the only regret that i would express is that there was no indication whatever of any expression of regret on the part of the government that such large sums of money held by many not particularly well-to-do football clubs had to be expended in a campaign to bring sense into this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> it gives me great pleasure because the matter was raised in the house on th january last year <e> <s> ministers undertook to discuss the matter and it has taken a year to make some progress <e> <s> nevertheless i welcome the information given to us today because it is obvious that the travelling public have the right to know about the level of crime that takes place on british railways <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the noble viscount will find that chief constables of home office police forces if i may describe them like that have an obligation to publish an annual report and submit it through their police authority <e> <s> is the minister aware that we very much hope that copies of the report will be made available not only to public libraries but also to the press so that the travelling public have information on this matter which affects their security when they travel on british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl first is he not aware of the accuracy of the point made by my noble friend lord jenkins namely that for months if not years some people in the public service have been fully aware of the fact that parliament had been misled <e> <s> that is absolutely obvious from the circumstances of this case <e> <s> is that not another reason why there should be an independent judicial inquiry into these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very sorry indeed if the question that i asked at committee stage were to get the noble earl lord ferrers into any trouble <e> <s> although i understand the reasons put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon if he and other noble lords will look at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords since we can make only one speech during report stage i do not propose to breach the rules of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble earl for repeating this statement <e> <s> i too think that there are a number of sensible proposals in the document <e> <s> however it would obviously be premature to express an opinion on many of them without having had the opportunity of reading the white paper <e> <s> the white paper deserves to be judged by three tests <e> <s> the first is whether it will bring down the size of our inmate population <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has observed we have the highest prison population in europe <e> <s> that is unhappily nearly the only european league table of which this country is top <e>", "<cs> my lords in how many cases has there been a termination of contract <e> <s> secondly how can he possibly say that there has been no deterioration in the quality of security given the fact that the association of chief police officers has made it clear that a substantial number of people employed by private security firms have formidable criminal records <e>", "<cs> my lords if the first priority is to protect our soldiers in this country how can it be right to withdraw ministry of defence police who can be armed and replace them by unarmed representatives of private security firms some of whom have significant criminal records <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply <e> <s> however does he recall that it is now just over months since ayatollah khomeini imposed his death sentence on mr rushdie <e> <s> is he also aware that since that time we have witnessed a series of threats made in this country against the life of mr rushdie who is still obliged to have armed detectives by his side in order to ensure that he is not murdered <e> <s> is he further aware that we have also witnessed constant threats which have been made by a number of individuals including dr siddiqui and that we have seen banners carried in public processions saying kill rushdie <e> <s> in those circumstances does he not agree that it is rather odd that criminal proceedings have not been instituted against a single individual <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that many of us still remain puzzled that not a single prosecution has been initiated against a single individual notwithstanding the clear evidence before our own eyes that death threats have been directed at mr rushdie <e> <s> was the noble and learned lord saying when he referred to the law i think i quote him correctly that the present law is insufficient <e> <s> if so no doubt the government will decide to bring forward further proposals <e> <s> if i may say so they have rightly taken the view that terrorism is a grave matter which requires the most robust response by government <e> <s> if the present law is inadequate what steps do the government propose to take to deal with that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government realise that the kind of question which has just been asked is undesirable <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that this is a clear case of international terrorism by iran <e> <s> as long as some of us are members of this house we shall raise the issue of threats made to the life of a british subject <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may declare an interest at the outset in that i am neither a barrister nor a solicitor <e> <s> it is rather necessary to say that in this debate because members of those professions have been abused in the press as a result of the positions they have taken on the bill <e> <s> it is the first occasion on which i have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that one of the problems in london is the activities of foreign banks <e> <s> is he aware that that problem was referred to in this house during a debate on a recent piece of government legislation concerning this matter <e> <s> is the minister further aware that his honourable friend the economic secretary to the treasury told me that this was a matter exclusively for the bank of england notwithstanding the fact that one of the foreign banks has through its subsidiaries been convicted in the federal court in florida of being involved in this unattractive form of business <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does he not recall that the home affairs committee of the house of commons described the criminal injuries compensation board as sinking under a mountain of paper and facing a bureaucratic nightmare <e> <s> while welcoming his right honourable friends announcement that there will be additional staff can the noble earl give an undertaking to the house that cases coming before the board will now be dealt with far more expeditiously <e> <s> is he aware that at present there is a backlog of cases before the board <e> <s> can he give any assurance that there will be a dramatic improvement in the situation within a matter of months <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that there is an overwhelming feeling in the house that the victims of crime deserve more protection <e> <s> will he therefore discuss with the chairman of the board the situation of people waiting months or two years to have their cases resolved <e> <s> is this not a matter of considerable urgency <e> <s> i would urge the noble earl to meet the chairman of the board to obtain some undertaking from him as to how long it will be before some of those long-delayed cases are proceeded with <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> he has referred to a communication from the director of public prosecutions to chief crown prosecutors <e> <s> perhaps i could ask whether they were requested to draw this matter to the attention of each chief constable in the force areas concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble lord lord denham of a precedent <e> <s> it relates to when he and his colleagues were in opposition and i was in charge of the criminal law bill for the home office <e> <s> i remember his noble and learned friend lord hailsham then leading for the opposition saying that it was quite intolerable for the house of lords to sit after half-past nine at night if law lords were expected to be present <e> <s> i remember the noble lord lord denham warmly agreeing with that proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the order <e> <s> i believe that the powers that it confers on ministers are justified on the basis of the terrorist threat to the united kingdom <e> <s> i am well aware of the concerns about exclusion orders <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the national drugs intelligence co-ordinator has estimated that drug traffickers in this country have assets of about million <e> <s> in the context of that situation does he appreciate that there is substantial disquiet about this bank operating in the united kingdom with a considerable number of branches <e> <s> the bank has been convicted in the federal courts in the united states of laundering large sums of money on behalf of the medellin drugs cartel <e> <s> is it not clear that in that situation it is necessary for the bank of england to take early action to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble earl aware that the bank of england was sharply criticised by the home affairs committee of the house of commons for being rather complacent in relation to money laundering <e> <s> in the context of that situation i hope i may remind the noble earl that the banking act to which he has drawn our attention requires banks operating in this country to conduct their business in a prudent manner and with integrity <e> <s> in the light of that situation have no treasury ministers found it necessary to discuss this matter with the governor of the bank of england who is of course accountable to ministers for his behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords have ministers had any discussion with the governor of the bank of england on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that the noble lord lord swansea tabled the prayer notwithstanding that i disagreed with almost everything he said <e> <s> however it is useful to have such a debate not only to discuss the level of fees which is a matter of concern to those holding firearms licences but also to look at some of the wider issues involved in firearms control <e> <s> some of those issues were touched upon by the noble lord lord kimballm <e>", "<cs> my lords it is particularly appropriate that the noble lord lord cocks of hartcliffe with his long record of service in bristol should raise this matter in this house this afternoon <e> <s> the issues that he has identified raise matters of very serious concern in all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be reminded who these gentlemen are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the noble earl for repeating this statement <e> <s> this has been a shocking episode <e> <s> it was frightening for the tens of thousands of people peacefully out shopping on a saturday afternoon <e> <s> it was frightening for the staffs of the shops some of which were invaded by numbers of looters <e> <s> it is an extraordinary situation when on a saturday afternoon in london people had to cower under the tables of restaurants to protect themselves from a wild rampaging mob <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble earl will pass on through the commissioner our very best wishes to all the police officers who were injured on saturday afternoon <e> <s> the police ambulance service and fire brigade carried out their duties with a high degree of competence and i believe that we should recognise that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords again i thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> this is a very serious episode <e> <s> it is clearly one of the most serious incidents of its kind for many years that has taken place in the british prison system <e> <s> however is the noble earl aware that those who know the prison governor mr ofriel regard him as one of the most experienced and competent governors in the prison service <e> <s> it is particularly fortunate that in the very difficult situation which occurred he was in charge of the establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement i wish to pay tribute to the governor mr ofriel and the prison officers at manchester who have behaved with considerable heroism over the past few days <e> <s> i also wish to associate myself and my noble friends with what the noble earl said about the prison officer and the remand prisoner who have died <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will recall that i asked him first whether lord justice woolf would sit in public and secondly whether he would have an assessor <e> <s> can the noble earl help me with answers to those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it is well known that a substantial number of money launderers have brought into this country suitcases packed with high denomination bank notes <e> <s> the noble earl does not need to apologise to the house for introducing the amendments at this stage <e> <s> they are highly desirable and in accord with provisions of the united states bank secrecy act <e> <s> i welcome the fact that we are moving in that direction <e> <s> i give an unreserved welcome to the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask a private notice question of which i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that this appears to be yet another copycat incident following the disturbances at strangeways prison manchester <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him a number of specific questions <e> <s> i realise that the governor and his staff have only just recovered possession <e> <s> how much accommodation at pucklechurch appears to have been lost and therefore necessitates the removal of a significant number of the prisons population to other establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earls last two sentences <e> <s> although understanding the reasons for the question by the noble lord lord mishcon some of us would be very concerned indeed were any form of urgent timetable to be applied to lord justice woolfs inquiry <e> <s> clearly he has a number of major issues at which to look and i believe it would be a profound mistake were he to be pressed for even the most admirable of reasons into delivering an early report <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not deal with the point at all <e> <s> the noble earl told us that were he to answer the question put to him he may be subject to a term of imprisonment <e> <s> he said it twice <e> <s> is the noble lord apologising on behalf of the noble earl for having inadvertently misled the house or is he seriously suggesting that the noble earl could have been sentenced to imprisonment for answering the questions put to him from these and other benches <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not doing himself justice <e> <s> he has been asked specifically whether a minister of the crown answering a question in this house could lay himself open to criminal prosecution and imprisonment <e> <s> is the answer to that question yes or no <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the noble earl for having repeated the statement and once again say how much we are indebted to mr ofriel and his colleagues for their cool and professional judgment throughout the entire dispute <e> <s> i regret the extremely ill-informed and foolish attacks made upon mr ofriel by some elements of the press <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble baroness a question on that matter <e> <s> the point has been made about the disturbances in connection with the poll tax trouble in trafalgar square <e> <s> is she aware that there has been a whole series of major public disorders in what could be described as the greater westminster area <e> <s> will additional facilities be made available at st thomass hospital to deal with such situations because as has been pointed out the delay in taking patients from westminster to fulham in the rush hour would create an extremely serious situation <e> <s> it could easily take minutes as most of those who drive cars are well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i make any statement on this amendment with considerable caution as i find myself among a number of scottish lawyers who inevitably have a great deal more experience in the matter than i have <e> <s> however i should like to confirm what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey said <e> <s> a number of scottish chief officers of police have complained to me about the totally unnecessary situation in which policemen are kept hanging around and are never called as witnesses <e> <s> that is a significant drain on police manpower and a substantial cost to the public <e> <s> it is not just a question of the police but of specialist witnesses <e> <s> i recognise some of the difficulties confronting the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has made a powerful case which deserves serious attention from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that virtually all of us warmly welcome any action to break up the european cartel on air fares <e> <s> however is he aware of the serious problems at present facing some of the smaller british airlines and the anxiety felt by many at the increasing monopolistic power of british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords we are coming to the end of not one but three prolonged debates on this issue first our take-note debate on the hetherington-chalmers report last december secondly the debate on the war crimes amendment to the law reform miscellaneous provisions scotland bill which took place last month and lastly todays debate <e> <s> i have calculated that there have so far been speeches on this question <e> <s> therefore it is possible that your lordships are now moving towards making a final judgment on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that there will be internal sanitation when the rebuilt remand facility is opened <e> <s> moreover is the noble earl aware that following strangeways and as a result of disputes with some branches of the prison officers association many hundreds of prisoners are now being held in police cells in most deplorable conditions <e> <s> what action does he propose to take to deal with that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords two constituencies are clearly too large <e> <s> there will now be three <e> <s> that seems wholly sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount put forward a powerful case for the regulations <e> <s> they will relieve the police of the necessity to investigate vexatious or repetitious complaints <e> <s> they will deal with tiresome people who pursue vendettas against a particular force or officer <e> <s> unhappily a number of people spend a considerable part of their lives doing so <e> <s> it is right that we should not passively accept the substantial expenditure of public money when complaints are investigated <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the home secretarys statement <e> <s> on behalf of members on these benches i express regret for the injury caused to the noble lord lord kaberry and to others by this despicable attack <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness indicated that she did not accept the nspcc figures and preferred those of her own department <e> <s> can she give the figures obtained by her department <e> <s> she did not tell the house what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not absolutely clear that as long as crown immunity continues so will degrading conditions at birmingham and other prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing particularly astonishing about the point i made concerning crown immunity <e> <s> it has been made consistently in this house <e> <s> every time we have attempted to write into a criminal justice bill a provision concerning crown immunity it has been opposed by the noble earls friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a member of the conservative party <e> <s> the noble lord has not done credit to his case by the latter observations in this speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say at the outset and on this point i believe there will be agreement on all sides of the house that it was a pleasure to listen to the maiden speech of my noble friend lord holme <e> <s> it was a speech of outstanding quality <e> <s> it is normal i know on occasions such as this to say that one hopes that one will soon have the privilege of hearing the noble lord again <e> <s> there is no need to worry about that consideration <e> <s> given the rather modest numbers of these benches the noble lord will have many opportunities in the relatively near future to participate in our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords first the number is not million it is million <e> <s> secondly my noble friend lord bonham-carter made his position on that matter clear at the outset of the debate and so if the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> my lords it is friday and the hour is fairly late <e> <s> i shall therefore be extremely brief in what i have to say <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale made an overwhelming case for this small and useful bill <e> <s> it has all-party support <e> <s> we on these benches are very much in favour of it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bonham-carter put his name to this amendment <e> <s> speaking in his absence i am sure that he would take the view that the minister has repeated the concession which was made by his honourable friend in the other place <e> <s> speaking for myself i take the view that the position of the licensee is even more important than the position of the commission itself <e> <s> therefore i welcome what the minister said and look forward to seeing the amendment when he tables it <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble lord lord willis said <e> <s> the position is that in the past some applications have been little more than essays in imaginative journalism <e> <s> the position as regards this amendment is that it would impose a clear duty upon the commission to compare what the licence holder said in his application with what he has done <e> <s> that seems to me wholly desirable <e> <s> i can see no serious argument against it <e> <s> in my view it would be highly advantageous to the boards of many of the companies because they would be aware that their record would be examined on an annual basis <e> <s> having had some past involvement with independent television i can say that the effect of such an amendment would undoubtedly increase the likelihood that companies would live up to the terms of their application <e>", "<cs> on the basis of what the minister has said in the past i assume that he will resist the amendment and i hope that he does <e> <s> it would be deeply objectionable were it to be passed <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury said that one of the least satisfactory features in the past has been that ministers when asked questions in this place say that the matter is not for them <e> <s> the noble earl regards the virtue of the amendment as being the fact that ministers would have to accept some responsibility for a code which had been passed by parliament <e> <s> is the committee aware of what it is being asked to do <e> <s> ministers would be invited to make a judgment on virtually every programme to which any member of the other place or for that matter this place took exception <e> <s> it is a preposterous proposal and i hope that it will be resisted <e>", "<cs> the minister is mistaken <e> <s> if a code has been passed by both houses of parliament it may then be said by a member of the other place or this place that there has been a breach of the code in respect of a programme <e> <s> a minister would then have to make a judgment as to whether that was so or not <e> <s> i speak as someone who had constantly to speak from the government front bench in this place having been invited to make a judgment on a television programme <e> <s> my answer was always as the noble earl lord halsbury said that the government did not take responsibility for such matters <e>", "<cs> i find it odd that noble lords who an hour or so ago were most enthusiastic about imposing every conceivable form of control on current affairs programmes and insisting that it must appear on the face of the bill are now making the speeches that they are delivering <e> <s> that is very strange indeed <e>", "<cs> but is not their economic performance more impressive than ours <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important debate <e> <s> i am sure that the house will forgive me if i speak with considerable brevity given that for a friday the hour is late and i do not wish to hold up some of the other debates <e> <s> i must declare a personal interest in the last of those debates <e> <s> i agree largely with everything that has been said by the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> we shall certainly welcome the day when the people of northern ireland are able to take a greater degree of responsibility for their own affairs <e> <s> i welcome as others have the initiative taken by the secretary of state <e> <s> he has handled the talks with a combination of considerable skill and great good sense <e> <s> we all wish him well in the continuing talks that are taking place with the government of the irish republic <e>", "<cs> rose to ask her majestys government what action they propose to take following the report by her majestys chief inspector of prisons on hm prison birmingham <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a few words <e> <s> the more i have listened to this debate the more certain i am that this amendment should be resisted <e> <s> in reality we are discussing a two-stage decision-making process one decision by the governor and one by the secretary of state <e> <s> however on the basis of my experience in the home office i can tell the committee that the effect of such a process would be to introduce massive delays in decision-making <e> <s> at the end of that would the decisions be any different <e> <s> i find it hard to believe that unless there is an overwhelming case against the governors decision home office officials would dream of varying it because he is the man on the spot with a clear knowledge of the situation <e> <s> it has been said on all sides of the committee that we want speed in this matter <e> <s> however i can guarantee that if the amendment were passed it would lead to massive delays in the process and therefore increase instability in hong kong <e>", "<cs> i shall speak only briefly <e> <s> the noble earl has been as forthcoming as he possibly could be <e> <s> he indicated first that he would certainly consider what was said in the course of the debate but he said subsequently that on the basis of the situation as he appreciated it it would be very nearly impossible for him to concede this amendment <e> <s> i do not see anything inconsistent with the tradition of this chamber in what he said <e>", "<cs> i suggest that we discuss amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i do not know whether that is convenient to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> this point has been made by his noble friend <e> <s> the argument appears to be exactly the same <e> <s> one of these amendments is ours <e>", "<cs> that was the suggestion i was endeavouring to make <e> <s> it will avoid the tedium of members of the committee having the opportunity of listening to us twice on the same issue <e> <s> i too spoke on this matter at second reading as did the noble lord lord irvine of lairg <e> <s> i very much agree with what he said <e> <s> to be blunt i was rather puzzled by the speech made by the noble earl lord ferrers <e> <s> it is as clear as can be that the effect of passing this clause as it is now drafted would be to exclude judicial review entirely <e> <s> therefore i find it difficult to comprehend why the noble earl took a different view <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak extremely briefly but i thought that it would be right to comment on the speeches made by the noble lords lord harmar-nicholls and lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> they raised the issue of public attitudes towards immigration <e> <s> that has been a sensitive issue in british politics for well over a quarter of a century <e> <s> the noble lord is right to look at the issue in terms of the speech made by the noble lord lord marsh on the last occasion <e> <s> he has been quoted on a number of occasions but i agreed with him profoundly in that part of his last speech when he said that the whole approach will have been proved a failure if we experience the arrival of heads of household and their dependants <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will be aware that the house does not have to accept the groupings of amendments
