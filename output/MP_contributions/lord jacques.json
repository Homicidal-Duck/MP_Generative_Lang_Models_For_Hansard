["<cs> my lords i hope that without sounding presumptuous i may be allowed to congratulate noble lords opposite on their appointments in government and especially those with whom i came into friendly conflict over the last five years <e> <s> i hope that they will enjoy putting forward and defending the policies of their government as much as i did <e> <s> but i believe that unfortunately for them time will tell that they are fighting a lost cause <e> <s> i thought that the last election brought out more than any other recent election the significant points of difference between the two main parties <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the most recent reorganisations carried out by a tory government involving the health service and local government did not turn out as they anticipated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by giving an explanation <e> <s> my noble friend lord lee of newton who was to speak next has had to leave us to attend a shadow cabinet meeting <e> <s> at the request of the whips we have changed places <e> <s> therefore my noble friend will speak later <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement refers to industrial disputes and also to the inability to get workers <e> <s> surely that indicates that there is at least a <e>", "<cs> my lords does the fact that the wage offer was rejected by five to one not show that there is widespread dissatisfaction within the ranks of the postal workers and that some investigation is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with previous speakers in congratulating the four maiden speakers and this is one occasion when we can say sincerely that we hope to hear from them very often in the future <e> <s> it is accepted that this country is one of the poorest members of the european economic community <e> <s> it is also true that we suffer from some of the disadvantages which inevitably overtake a pioneer but our resources both human and material are such especially our resources of energy and our experience of manufacture that we should be one of the richest members of the community and we could be one of the richest if we could find a way of co-operating and working together rather than spending our resources fighting each other <e> <s> that is putting it bluntly but i believe that it is the core of the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to deal with the subject of taxation but i mentioned it so i think i must answer the question <e> <s> as i said when i spoke in the debate on the queens speech and this was before the budget i would accept a moderate transfer from direct to indirect taxation but of course i regard what happened in the budget as an immoderate transfer <e> <s> i believed there was a case for a moderate transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government consider making it a condition <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that since this matter has been going on for some time it has now become a matter of urgency that some action should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that eight months ago from the place where he is now sitting i gave exactly the same answers as he has given <e> <s> there is at least one thing on which we are agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been fortunate this afternoon in having three maiden speeches which have portrayed great experience and a wealth of knowledge <e> <s> i join with other members of the house in congratulating the maiden speakers and in hoping that we shall hear from them often <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> whether or not one agrees with him i think it was accepted on all sides of the house that he made a lucid and informed speech <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord excuse my interrupting him <e> <s> does that not apply to every post-war government <e>", "<cs> my lords i still think that the noble lord has misunderstood the point <e> <s> the point that has been raised is that there should be a directive not that there should not be one but that it should lay down principles and not go into too much detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on having introduced this important subject and for giving us an opportunity of discussing it <e> <s> i want to speak briefly on one aspect alone the shortage of skilled workers on the workshop floor <e> <s> i am confining myself to that aspect because it is second in importance only to the need for improved industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the government are going to pursue the proposed alternative runway <e> <s> there was a proposal that there should be an alternative runway as distinct from a second runway <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> it at least gives me the opportunity of asking supplementaries <e> <s> is the minister aware that the economists concerned are experienced in forecasting that they use the treasury computer forecasting model and that they published the make-up of their per cent <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is now becoming quite apparent where government policy is leading us <e> <s> in the short term it is feeding inflation in the middle term it is going to cause hardship by unnecessary unemployment and unnecessary bankruptcy and in the long term it is going to give us the most left-wing government we have ever had in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that by the last government had got the inflation rate down to something under per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords hitherto gas and electricity have been classified with housing and food and have been regarded as essentials to the consumer and have been free of vat <e> <s> but now we are to go to the other extreme and have what in effect is a special tax on gas and electricity <e> <s> while i have no doubt that the need for equalisation of fuel prices and the need for conservation of energy have been important questions in the governments reasoning i do not believe that they have been the overriding considerations <e> <s> i believe that the overriding consideration in the governments reasoning is the need as they see it to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement the psbr and consequently i am going to devote my time to that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords we had indeed a statutory incomes policy when the last conservative government were in power <e> <s> an incomes policy can be either voluntary or statutory <e> <s> the real point is that this government did not wish to work with the tuc <e> <s> if they had gone to the tuc in a spirit of cooperation instead of a spirit of antagonism there could probably have been an incomes policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount may speak when i have finished <e> <s> i shall finish my speech <e> <s> of the three instruments which are available for controlling the demand for money as i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to put to the house and particularly to the minister the views of the consumer co-operative movement <e> <s> that movement handles per cent <e> <s> of the retail food trade and in addition it has quite substantial factories doing food processing <e>", "<cs> my lords you need timetables for that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when management has an instrument which does not cost anything and is admitted to be useful it is bad management practice to throw it away <e>", "<cs> the party opposite is being as contradictory in office as it was in opposition <e> <s> first of all we are told that the price commission was a waste of money it was completely ineffective <e> <s> then in the next breath we are told that it had serious effects it reduced the profits and therefore reduced investment <e> <s> you cannot have it both ways <e> <s> the noble viscount further said that their inflation government-induced was once-and-for-all <e> <s> i do not think that stands up to examination <e> <s> i believe that the government are going to find out sooner or later that <e>", "<cs> it was not the last government that formed the working party <e> <s> it was the officials and the officials are still there <e>", "<cs> i am not depending upon advice given to ministers i am depending on recommendations which were published <e> <s> they are known to everybody and i hope that noble lords opposite will not argue with me about this because we shall only get into deeper water <e>", "<cs> i am simply saying that the report was the result of the work of a working party all the minister did was to write the foreword <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> surely it is quite in order should like to know why the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is shaking his head in dissent before even hearing what i am about to say and perfectly proper to quote in support of this amendment opinions given by a working group and published to the world at large which is all i am doing <e> <s> i am not dealing with private advice and i do not know what the private advice was <e>", "<cs> as i understand it they were the views of officials during the period of office of the last administration <e>", "<cs> yes he presented the report of the working party and i am going to quote from that working partys report <e> <s> i can see nothing wrong in that and i shall take a lot of convincing that there is anything wrong in it <e>", "<cs> i suggest it would be much more reasonable for the committee and everybody concerned if noble lords opposite waited until it was their turn to speak and then replied and did not try to reply to every other sentence uttered from this side <e>", "<cs> may i say first that if i in any way transgressed convention i apologise of course but i did not feel that i did and i still do not feel that i did <e> <s> i am quoting something which was published and which is available to everybody <e> <s> that is the difference i think <e> <s> that is the important difference and i think it is a difference which entitles me to quote it as i did <e>", "<cs> what the minister is saying in effect is that after years when we have had annual reports if we take them altogether there may be a code of practice <e> <s> that is not something that i could accept <e>", "<cs> may i leave the committee with this thought <e> <s> had my amendment been moved by a member of the party opposite from where i am standing it would have been carried by a huge majority <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to all three points which have been made <e>", "<cs> before he knows there is going to be an investigation <e>", "<cs> i think this is sheer obstinacy <e> <s> this amendment clearly improves the bill <e> <s> it does not involve any serious delay <e> <s> it avoids the confusion of publication followed by veto which is in nobodys interest <e> <s> but i am not going to press this to a vote <e> <s> i think the government are being damned obstinate <e>", "<cs> the argument is exactly the opposite to what the minister has said <e> <s> he has confused the facts <e> <s> he has transposed the two matters <e> <s> i think that <e>", "<cs> i think that i should first reply to the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i have no recollection of rejecting an amendment of this kind on the bill during our term of office <e> <s> i invite the noble lord to produce the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the post office is not alone in the increase of service charges and that it is due to the high content of labour in doing the work <e> <s> i think an examination will show that in many cases other service charges have risen far more than those of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords it was never suggested that the illustrative list would be exhaustive or that in all circumstances the practices that were illustrated would be anti-competitive <e> <s> that was made clear in the green paper of march <e> <s> the whole of the governments defence has been based upon the question of illustrative practices and the wisdom or otherwise of publishing a list <e> <s> would the government accept the need for issuing guidance notes in general without reference to any illustrative practice in so far as the director general may feel that that should be part of it <e> <s> it is general practice as regards other legislation to <e>", "<cs> my lords i would regard that as an interruption <e> <s> i am strongly tempted to divide the house <e> <s> i take the view that the government are acting unreasonably in not being prepared to issue guidance notes and probably the time has come when those who support this unreasonableness should be counted <e> <s> however having put this amendment in principle during the committee stage and lost it there shall have to leave the matter at that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i repeat what the report said <e> <s> it was a report of the council on tribunals on <e>", "<cs> my lords it did not say legal costs <e> <s> recommendation no <e> <s> reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that if the commission come to the view that a case ought never to have been referred to it the director general will have acted unreasonably and the secretary of state should bear the costs <e> <s> i shall press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if it means per cent <e> <s> why not say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not try to follow my noble friend <e> <s> i find it astonishing that a government which are so committed to supporting the family should propose a child allowance of p less than the index-value and at one and the same time allow the bankers to retain what the chancellor himself described as a windfall which has nothing whatever to do with either efficiency or enterprise <e> <s> that will rebound back upon the government themselves <e> <s> in the same way as night follows day high profits are followed by demands for high wages and salaries <e> <s> wages and salaries are increasing at a tremendous rate in the financial sector and that will give a new basis for comparison elsewhere and consequently it will feed inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view the interest rate is the greatest factor <e> <s> i think that we shall probably find that out shortly because the interest rate will probably come down and then we shall see a change in the rate of the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the changes in the media over the last decade or so has the time not come that when you have a film which is so against our national interest its display should be prohibited by a resolution of the house of commons confirmed by this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we shall see a reduction only because the increase in vat will no longer be in the index <e> <s> is he further aware that in maintaining high rates of interest for a long period the government are going against what has been accepted as good economic sense over the past or years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and i should like to put to him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first is he aware that a document published by the chemical industries association this month indicated that the gas prices paid by united kingdom industry as at st april were on average per cent <e> <s> greater than the gas prices paid by industries in those eec countries which i have named in the question <e> <s> secondly would the minister not agree that if the industries in other eec countries are being supplied with cheaper gas for whatever reason then this government should have reduced the prices to our industry so that it is not handicapped and so that there is greater harmony in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it that the time lag seems to make it cheaper for everybody else except the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord alport has spoken with his usual courage and independence of thought and i have seldom followed a speaker from the benches opposite with whom i was in so much agreement <e> <s> the level of unemployment we are witnessing today is a direct result of deliberate government-chosen policy and we have worse to come <e> <s> witness the report of the cbi and its review published earlier this week <e> <s> they found that business confidence was lower than at any time since the three-day week in <e> <s> of course nobody should be astonished at that because for the greater part of the interval the country was blessed with a labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the whole history of this shows that there are delaying tactics <e> <s> and the sooner the government are prepared to deal with those delaying tactics the better <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the figures which he gave regarding earnings are a direct result of government policy <e> <s> when there is a free-for-all the workers are part of the all <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that after months of the present governments policy we have a decline in industrial output of per cent <e> <s> million unemployed and still have inflation at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down would she agree that the additional cost that she mentioned is not added cost that it is a transfer of cost from the county to the city <e> <s> that is what the city is commenting upon <e> <s> it is not more cost but merely a transfer from one authority to another <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of whether this is the appropriate bill i say that this bill is such an omnibus that there is no harm in it having another passenger <e> <s> i would point out to the minister that the magistrates courts are self-financing <e> <s> the amount received in fines by the home office is the income and the amount which is spent on the courts is the expenditure <e> <s> they are very largely self-financing <e> <s> so far as consultation is concerned the magistrates connection is with the county committee <e> <s> as i have said there has been consultation with the county magistrates courts committee <e> <s> they know that this amendment is before the house tonight and in general they have no comment to make <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances while i feel so strongly that i could not withdraw the amendment i will certainly not force a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i first join with other noble lords in congratulating the right reverend prelate and the noble lord lord weinstock on their maiden speeches <e> <s> i hope that both will find future opportunities to come here and give us the benefit of their knowledge and experience <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord weinstock that he and i have one thing in common i like things to be simple <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no hesitation in saying that this would be completely in line with what my noble friend has in mind <e> <s> i followed the national plan with very great care and served on one of my noble friends regional committees and i would say that it was very much in line <e> <s> i would only add that i should like the approach next time to be a little more simple with not so much involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the government give a little discouragement to the neb for disposing of its holdings it would show a glimmer of consensus which would be welcomed by moderates in all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords should it not be the policy of the government to encourage the neb to keep shares which are profitable so that it is less dependent upon government finance <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ask his right honourable friend to keep in mind that if the government follow up this proposal of transferring the payment of sick benefit to employers they will be doing exactly the opposite of what they advocated in opposition <e> <s> when the last government were in office i was responsible for the employment bill <e> <s> in that bill there was a provision that the maternity benefit should be borne by the employers <e> <s> there was strong opposition from the tory benches in both this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware on the matter which has been raised that there is no distinction between maternity and sickness benefit <e> <s> in both cases the question was whether it should be borne by the employer or funded <e> <s> in opposition you wanted it funded in government you want it borne by employers <e> <s> con con <e> <s> you cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> my lords why are the government so short-sighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that that is a little bit of a u-turn <e> <s> ever since they took office the noble lord and his colleagues have been telling us that the changes in the money supply would be reflected in the changes in inflation after a period of months to two years <e> <s> are they now departing from that philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree after his experience of the last months that every government have to spend their way out of a depression <e> <s> the only choice they have is whether they spend it on unemployment benefit or on aids to industry and thus increase the supply of goods and services <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose this bill <e> <s> i would first declare my interests <e> <s> in common with million of my fellow countrymen i am a member of a co-operative society <e> <s> in that society i have a small investment and receive a fixed rate of interest and so far as they are able to my family buy their requirements from that society <e> <s> i think that the house will agree that my financial interest is negligible <e> <s> on the other hand i have to admit to a substantial professional interest <e> <s> i have not only been in the management of retail distribution pretty well the whole of my working life but i was involved in the initiation and development of the first self-service stores in this country and i wrote a booklet on the subject <e> <s> i have continued my interest on the subject and i therefore admit that i have a very strong professional interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not concerned as to whether you can see a or b what am saying and what is supported by the report from which i have quoted is that the environment of the home is more likely to be conducive to controlled drinking than is the environment of the pub and anyone with experience of both i think would verify that whether they are in favour of this bill or not <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl remind his right honourable friend the prime minister of the advice which is reputed to have come from mr baldwin that no british prime minister should ever get into mortal combat with the vatican the treasury or the num <e>", "<cs> my lords in any consideration of this matter will the government bear in mind that sunday is about the only day of the week when shopworkers can be with their families and friends <e> <s> will the government also bear in mind that it is extremely likely that any general opening of shops on sundays would increase the costs of distribution which would have to be reflected in prices <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering this problem will the government bear in mind that in british life there are many things that do not appear to be logical but which work because they are based upon reasonable compromises <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the right reverend prelate on his maiden speech <e> <s> i think that it reflected the man as we have known him over the years <e> <s> i would also congratulate the noble earl on the considerable skill which he showed in getting over the great difficulties in presenting a plausible case for government policy <e> <s> i should now like to state the opposite side of the story <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy as we have been told from time to time has been based very narrowly and very strictly on tight monetary control <e> <s> it is also due to the governments attitude to industry <e> <s> i would not go as far as to say that it has been an attitude of confrontation but i would say that it has been an attitude of unwillingness to co-operate an attitude of being dogmatic which is reflected in the rhetoric there is no other way there is no alternative when everybody who is not blind knows that there are alternatives which are worthy of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords it might have coughed up million in redundancy payments <e> <s> that just spells out what i am saying <e> <s> it is a perfectly competitive and efficient firm and yet it has redundancies on a substantial scale <e> <s> i have in mind for example an enterprise of which i have first-hand knowledge <e> <s> that enterprise has been planned during the last five or six years at a capital cost of million <e> <s> every possible step was taken to ensure that the very latest methods and the most sophisticated methods were used in order to get the absolute minimum unit costs <e> <s> the enterprise commenced business last year <e> <s> it has attained the output which was expected but it is showing a loss because of excessive interest charges which it has to pay upon the capital <e> <s> that enterprising firm is having its reserves depleted and frittered away in excessive interest charges <e>", "<cs> my lords an excessive interest charge is one which is high because it is unnecessarily inspired by government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords just a minute the noble viscount has either made his speech or will get an opportunity to do so <e> <s> it is now my turn <e> <s> there you have an example of a firm which during the last decade has been planning this and has taken every step to get the absolutely perfect sophisticated methods to achieve the lowest unit costs <e> <s> it has attained the output required but it is losing money because of government policy <e> <s> our industries have been suffering for far too long from the over-valuation of the pound <e> <s> it should have been part of government policy to bring the pound into line with the domestic price levels <e> <s> but instead the government have used all their powers and all their resources to maintain the value of the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if there was any inclination on the part of the government to improve the income of widows it would be best done by increasing the amount paid rather than giving it free of taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister bear in mind that there are considerations other than the immediate effect on the prison population <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how many workshops if any have been closed since the government took office <e>", "<cs> this amendment is identical to one that was submitted on report stage in another place <e> <s> i introduce it to the committee on this occasion for two reasons <e> <s> first because it raises a very important issue namely that <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to two points raised by the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> first he thought this was a matter for professional guidelines <e> <s> but we already have the professional guidelines the institute and faculty of architects have issued their guidelines to the actuaries employed in life assurance companies <e> <s> what is absent is an obligation on the part of the company to supply the information and i am trying to fill that gap <e>", "<cs> if the minister will give way would he not agree that when the protection of policyholders is involved it is not just a matter between the company and the actuary it is a question of the policyholders interests and is a matter in which the government of the day should have an interest <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the minister is saying i cannot undertake that the government will bring forward proposals of their own but on the other hand if the noble lord lord jaques cares to come to consult with me to see if we can get an agreement i would be happy to do that <e> <s> is that the position <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble baroness for giving us this opportunity to discuss an area of law in which there are undoubtedly anomalies and indeed some uncertainty as to its application and enforcement <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate her on the way in which she introduced the debate <e> <s> so far as the shopkeeper is concerned no one can say that there is a consensus <e> <s> however one can say that a vast number perhaps the majority do not want a free-for-all <e> <s> they believe that extended shop hours would increase their costs particularly those for heating and lighting and there would be premium payments for staff working unsocial hours <e> <s> they are not convinced that longer hours would mean that more trade would be available <e> <s> indeed if the costs of the extended hours were passed on to the consumer the real volume of trade might in fact decline <e> <s> however there is a consensus among shopkeepers on one matter and that is that they believe that it would be wrong to have piecemeal change <e> <s> they want to see a thorough review proper consultation and a wide ranging law dealing with the whole issue <e>", "<cs> my lords why <e> <s> because i like a little quietness on a sunday and i believe that my fellow citizens also like a little quietness on a sunday <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment from experience as a magistrate <e> <s> i think research will show that of all the motoring offences the greatest variety of fines is for careless driving because there are so many different circumstances <e> <s> if the court has that discretion on fines and there is that great variety then there is need for some flexibility in the points system in regard to those offences <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that there is scope here for compromise between the two amendments and the attitude of the government <e> <s> i can understand the governments attitude that it will take the time of the court but the court already has to decide on the fine and i can say from experience that those fines are decided quite quickly <e> <s> that is not the kind of thing on which the courts spend very much time <e> <s> however it seems to me that there is a possibility of compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords have we reached the stage when a public body if not successful is damned but if it is successful it has to sell out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that reply and put two supplementary questions to him <e> <s> first will the minister bear in mind that <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that it is inconceivable that the royal navy should continue to occupy the whole of this land and offer little employment <e> <s> what action is being taken to ensure that as much land as possible is made available as quickly as possible and that it is used to attract alternative industries <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is not suggested that three years will be sufficient to get new industries to re-employ about people in the present circumstances <e> <s> may i suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that is absurd <e> <s> in the circumstances it would take much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> will he bear in mind that in the opinion of many magistrates who hear these cases there are occasions when there are grave injustices <e> <s> is the minister aware that the cost of eliminating this injustice is so small and that the cost of keeping children in care is so great that there might actually be a saving in total expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is really impossible to have certainty when forecasting future income and expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord constantine of stanmore <e> <s> it was a breath of fresh air to have a concise and incisive speech supporting the nationalised industries and also the consumer <e> <s> i hope we shall hear him often and from time to time on the same topics <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the second reading of this bill <e> <s> the bill seeks to make it an offence to sell a beverage which is not contained in a refundable container and it obliges the retailer to make the refund <e> <s> it applies not only to glass but to plastics and to metal containers although the latter two cannot be re-used and there are known problems in regard to re-cycling <e>", "<cs> my lords you are making a lot of fuss about america but only per cent <e> <s> of the citizens of the united states have this kind of law <e> <s> less than per cent <e> <s> the second conclusion was that a restriction on consumer choice was not justified nor was there any justification for beverage containers being singled out from the packaging problem as a whole <e> <s> the third conclusion was that a mandatory system of returnable beverage containers was not desirable was not practicable and instead efforts should be made to improve the trippage and recycling which had already commenced <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the noble baroness has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> i did not say that was a network <e> <s> i said there were towns which were covered by the bottle banks and that the country was covered by a network of depots for re-cycling of glass <e>", "<cs> the glass manufacturers expect that they will be able to recycle metric tonnes by april of next year and by april they expect to be able to recycle metric tonnes <e> <s> that is the kind of progress which is being made in recycling which was recommended by the study group <e> <s> now the friends of the earth make a great deal of song about what is happening in america <e> <s> but as i pointed out only per cent <e> <s> of the americans are covered by this kind of legislation <e> <s> they make a song about oregon but they have little to say about michigan <e> <s> i understand that in michigan they have had this law for upwards of five years and that their prices for beverages are per cent <e> <s> higher than they are in the neighbouring states and that their sales are down per cent <e> <s> since the introduction of this kind of legislation <e>", "<cs> the quantities then were exceedingly small my lords whereas nowadays they are enormous <e> <s> it is not only the greater quantity quantity would not matter so much if there were not the much greater variety <e> <s> in the last years the increase in variety has made a big difference to the problem <e> <s> my noble friend can take it from me that if we had only refillable glass bottles the variety that would have to be available in the bigger shops would have to be reduced drastically because of the problems of handling and storing the empties <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a well conducted family never has to sell the furniture to pay the grocery bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount would our industry be more competitive if it had to bear the whole cost of million people unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord on his tenacity in bringing back an amended version of his bill and on the lucid way in which he has explained it <e> <s> he is a man of considerable independence of thought and he pursues those thoughts with courage <e> <s> i think that meets with admiration on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that it was withdrawn because the talking was going on for ever and other things were being held up in the meantime <e> <s> if that is not talking out i do not know what talking out is <e> <s> the third occasion when this house showed a great willingness to change was in the early seventies when we joined the eec <e> <s> the house immediately set about changing its methods and making provision for the consideration of directives from the commission and it did it so well that the way in which it did it and the work which is being done by the committee concerned have been admired throughout the whole of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords there are several points to which i wish to reply <e> <s> first of all why am i speaking from the second bench <e> <s> it is not customary for a deputy chairman to speak from the front bench and so i speak from one bench behind <e> <s> secondly as far as talking out is concerned i used the phrase talking out in quite a literal way and in quite a loose sort of way <e> <s> i was not referring to any particular standing orders and to all intents and purposes the bill was talked out <e> <s> incidentally i believe that the leader of the house of commons on that day was polically wise not to put the guillotine question to have done that would have been silly <e> <s> i now come to my final point how do i reconcile my partys decision to abolish with my support of the bill <e> <s> that is quite easy <e> <s> this bill is not saying abolish or dont abolish <e> <s> this bill is saying have a referendum <e> <s> my party has made no decision on that issue and therefore i am quite free to follow the noble lord lord alport into the division lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if the government had given a bit more attention to the retail price index and a bit less attention to monetary control they might have been more successful in controlling inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the very reason why <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that since exchange controls were removed there has been an outflow of capital of million and that the inflow has been only million and that this huge gap is having an upward pressure on interest rates which are crippling even our most efficient firms and discouraging investment in home industry <e>", "<cs> my lords in condemning any sector which acted unreasonably would the minister include the government themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i congratulate my noble friend lord beswick on the terms of his motion but more especially on the quality of his speech <e> <s> it was a pleasure to see frank beswick back at the <e>", "<cs> no i have not told anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble viscount on his maiden speech and express the wish that he will be able to come here frequently and give us the point of view of the younger men <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble baroness first on her persistence but more on the quality of her speech in introducing the bill <e> <s> however i regret to say that even if i accepted the objectives of the bill i could not agree that this bill is the right way of doing it and i will come to that in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords my reply to that is this very often in order to keep our market share we are forced to do things we would rather not do and this is a point i shall be dealing with later in my speech <e> <s> the consumer co-operative movement is opposed to this bill and to any bill which gives complete freedom of trade on sunday for both economic and social reasons <e> <s> we are firmly of the opinion that if there was a free-for-all on sunday many traders who do not wish to have their shops open on sundays would be forced to do so because they could not risk losing part of their market share <e> <s> that is the real world <e> <s> the real world is not this voluntary business where you can please yourself that is the fairy world <e> <s> the real world is can you afford to do what you want to do and lose part of your market share <e> <s> the fact is that many cannot afford that and many traders would be forced to open on sunday in order to avoid losing part of their market share because they wanted to keep their business viable <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord lord alport did not want a confrontation but he did want the issue discussed in this house and he said that it could be discussed on a motion <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord have another look at the matter to see whether it would be possible to have some restriction <e> <s> perhaps the restriction i have indicated namely paragraph would not be sufficient and that there should be a little more <e> <s> frankly however it need not be the whole schedule <e> <s> let us try to reduce the expenditure of local authorities <e> <s> over the years parliament has tended to give local government elaborate duties and responsibilities and then at the end of the day to grumble because they spend too much <e> <s> in this case expenditure by local authorities could be restricted and lest anybody thinks we are speaking of a minor expense i assure the committee from long experience of private or co-operative business that by making cuts of this sort all over the place in the end one gets a big saving <e> <s> that is where good management comes in <e> <s> i therefore ask the minister to have another look at the issue to avoid having unnecessarily long newspaper advertisements which today are costlier than ever <e>", "<cs> i shall be glad to do that but i emphasise that i am very serious about this <e> <s> it may be a small point but it is a most important one affecting good management <e> <s> i shall have a good look at the marshalled list to see if anything has been tabled for report and if on the final day when amendments must be tabled i see that nothing has been done there will be another amendment tabled by me <e> <s> on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a layman i wish to comment on the phrase relevant locality <e> <s> we now have bigger district councils and in practically all cases the district would have to be divided up so as to be reasonable in relation to the definition in the schedule <e> <s> but even when it has been divided up according to the character of each separate locality the local authority could decide to say nil nil nil for each one which would have the same effect as putting them all together and saying nil once <e> <s> frankly therefore i do not think the minister has much to look at if i were him i should leave it where it is <e> <s> assuming that we get amendment no <e> <s> later i am assuming that we shall get both amendments nos <e> <s> and then so far as i am concerned we shall have got the substance and having got the substance i shall not argue about drafting <e> <s> i am happy to leave that to the government having ventilated my point of view and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at the third attempt i think i am entitled to speak now <e> <s> i would remind the committee that over the years parliament has taken the view that the environment is so important to the community that environmental decisions as to the use of land and buildings should be made only by people who are elected and not by the courts <e> <s> in other words a political decision rather than a judicial decision <e> <s> you have it obviously in planning <e> <s> if an application is made for a particular use of land and buildings it has to be made to the planning authority which consists of elected councillors <e> <s> if in the final analysis there is an appeal that appeal is decided by the secretary of state in the elected government <e> <s> it never goes to court <e>", "<cs> is the minister stating that the objective which i am seeking can be attained without this amendment because of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> in that case i will study what the minister has said and if necessary come back at report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that no one in private industry would ever be guided by historic costs <e> <s> there has been inflation for years <e> <s> how can the historic cost be of any importance when what matters is how much the property can be sold for at the present time <e>", "<cs> what i said and what i repeat is this if the garden centre also wants to be a hardware shop and a builders merchants it can be up until one oclock on a sunday <e> <s> similarly the builders merchants and hardware shop could open until one oclock <e> <s> after one oclock the garden centre could only sell the goods indicated in the schedule <e>", "<cs> on that we have retained the existing provisions of the present law we have made no change <e> <s> the fourth thing we have done having improved the law to make it much more satisfactory is to introduce fines for contravention of the law <e> <s> those fines are given in the amendment <e> <s> i should like to say to those people who want seven-day free trading you have to take into account the views of the retailer and the shop-worker and by this amendment you are getting per cent <e> <s> of what you want <e> <s> if this amendment is adopted we have free trade for days and on a time basis that is thirteen-fourteenths or per cent <e> <s> so this amendment is conceding to those who want complete freedom for days a week per cent <e> <s> of what they want <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord harris of high cross will kindly give way i should like to make it clear that scotland is quite different from england and wales so far as shopping is concerned apart from two or three large towns scotland is a series of small towns and villages <e> <s> the multiples are not established in scotland as they are in england and wales <e> <s> the outcome of this bill would be entirely different in england and wales from what it would be in scotland it would be more like what happened in america <e>", "<cs> i am hoping that this might be the time to close this debate <e> <s> i have a whole sheaf of notes which would allow me to reply to the debate but quite frankly i think that your lordships have all made up your minds as to whether you are going to vote for or against <e> <s> i suggest that we take the vote and i therefore invite the committee to divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> may i assume that he is aware that this is a common practice in north america where it is not only convenient but saves a great deal of money in costs <e>", "<cs> my lords if this bill ever sees the light of day as legislation the real motive power behind it will be fear <e> <s> even if they do not want to do so people will feel compelled to open their shops on sundays in order to retain their market share <e> <s> employees will work on sundays not because they want to do so but because they will be afraid of losing their jobs <e> <s> fear will be the most important of the motive powers and this will apply whether this amendment is in the bill or not <e> <s> therefore i feel quite indifferent <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> scotland i think is quite different <e> <s> i believe that the pattern that we are likely to get in this country will be more like that in some of the states of america than that in scotland <e> <s> because of the distribution of population the concentration of mutiples and department stores is different here from that in scotland <e> <s> one can find any number of places that are different for example the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble baroness on the way in which she has piloted her bill through the house <e> <s> i think that it has met with admiration on all sides not only among her friends but also among her opponents <e> <s> next i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> i think that we were told on second reading that there was an understanding between the department and the trade union that before any general legislation was introduced the trade union would at least be informed <e> <s> there was an implication that they would be given an opportunity to put their point of view and that it might go as far as consultation <e> <s> i should like to know whether that applies to this bill as the government have been so benevolent in their neutrality <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would give way on two points before he leaves that matter <e> <s> first the increase in the price of oil increased the balance of payments surplus <e> <s> it was something that occurred which the government did not expect <e> <s> secondly would the noble lord bear in mind that when we were in office instead of having the benefits of exporting oil we had to import the capital equipment which was necessary to produce the oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the ministers conclusion <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for amendment no <e> <s> and the consequentials which go with it <e> <s> i have no hesitation in saying that when we come to my amendment no <e> <s> i shall not move it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the governments policy has been so successful why is it that some of the best authorities are forecasting that we shall have million unemployed until <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that arbitration both sides accepting the decision is the best alternative to industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we could save some time if the minister would give straight answers to two questions <e> <s> first is he accepting amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> secondly is he accepting amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this tax on this kind of thing completely undesirable and unforeseen and should it not be put right in some future finance act <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not reasonable to take the corporations activities in education as a whole <e> <s> they arc not for profitable purposes <e> <s> is it not right that as they are statutorily bound to provide these courses they should be exempt from tax <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that pretty well all that he has said is not new but has been going on for years <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that perhaps the best alternative to industrial action is arbitration to which both sides can put their cases fairly <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord is referring to the amendment which dealt with ships <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the difference is this <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> tried to knock out the five-yearly ballot and put nothing in its place <e> <s> we are trying to knock out the five-yearly ballot but to put in its place that a minority of per cent <e> <s> can require a ballot <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord that if all that is stopping him from supporting this amendment is that the ballots could be too frequent i am quite willing to discuss with him between now and report stage how fequently a ballot should be allowed <e> <s> let us carry this amendment before we take the next step <e>", "<cs> i think everybody will agree that it is time we wound up the debate <e> <s> the issue before the committee is a very narrow one <e> <s> it is simply whether there should be a ballot every five years or only when it is requested by per cent <e> <s> of the employees concerned and the latter course would embody in the bill the principle which is enshrined in the companies act <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> i think that there have been only three points raised against it <e> <s> first the noble baroness lady seear said that it would be difficult to get per cent <e> <s> i think that the answer to that is that it would certainly not be any more difficult than it is for shareholders and if it is good enough to put the provision in the companies act it is good enough to put it in this bill <e>", "<cs> i should imagine that having to get per cent <e> <s> when the ballot comes will cause more disturbance <e>", "<cs> or per cent <e> <s> of those who may vote <e>", "<cs> we still think that there would be greater disturbance and more extensive periods of preparation if there were ballots every five years <e> <s> there would be six months during which there was no work done at all other than preparing for the ballot whereas with the trigger mechanism that we have suggested there would be less frequent ballots and in our opinion there would he less disturbance of output <e>", "<cs> i suggest that it would be for the convenience of the committee to have one debate on this question of percentages <e> <s> if the government front bench agree with that i am quite prepared to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> in any atempt to change established rules and regulations it is normal practice to require more than per cent <e> <s> there are many examples of that <e> <s> for example under the companies act in order to pass a special resolution changing the <e>", "<cs> would the noble viscount give way <e> <s> my amendments deal only with existing closed shops <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in a really civilised society there would be no strikes in the hospital service <e> <s> when negotiations and conciliation could not settle the issue arbitration would be the accepted order of the day <e> <s> is the minister further aware that by refusing arbitration the government themselves are largely responsible for the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords i would draw the attention of the noble lord the minister to the fact that at least one matter has had the support of both sides of the house on several occasions the need for further capital investment now <e> <s> it came from both sides and from several speakers from both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords i was astonished at the attack which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made upon my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is a very experienced politician and i should have thought that he was well aware of the fact that very often in politics the principal question is one of priorities <e> <s> what my noble friend was pleading was not equality in misery he was pleading that there were other cases which should receive far greater priority <e> <s> that is a reasonable argument and i am surprised that that should not have been seen by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to assume that the government wish to be free to enter into contracts with people who pay unfair wages <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister explain to the house how he arrives at the market level when there is only one seller of a commodity like gas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that every employer could take that view and say i am going to decide and nobody else <e> <s> that is what it amounts to <e> <s> is he further aware that the government as the ultimate employer have a responsibility for the industrial relations in those departments and activities which they control <e> <s> is he further aware that one of the best things you can do to prevent unrest is to have proper systems of conciliation and arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i put some supplementary questions to him <e> <s> first is the minister aware that the abolition of the per cent <e> <s> income tax rate in the failure to index income tax allowances in and the increase of the national health contribution from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> have all worsened the poverty trap <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord further aware that we now have reached the situation when a family can increase its income from to per week and find that it is only p better off at the end of the week because of its liability to tax national insurance and the loss of social security benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that perhaps one of the best ways of at least mitigating the poverty trap lies in the application of the national health insurance contribution <e>", "<cs> i should like to plead with the minister to give consideration to this amendment because of its significance <e> <s> it has great psychological significance <e> <s> if we are going to help the kind of people that we have in mind there are one or two principles that have to be observed <e> <s> first of all if we want them to go somewhere for help they should go to the place that they are accustomed to visiting to the town hall rather than the court <e> <s> they should not be involved in something which they feel will immediately involve them in some big expense such as going to a solicitor <e> <s> the hearing procedure should be informal rather than formal <e> <s> i suggest that on all these grounds the rent officer is more likely to do the job better than the court <e>", "<cs> in the absence of this amendment would an owner who charges a premium allows the caravan to come on to the site and then later offers an <e>", "<cs> the minister has made it clear to the committee that what the government are seeking is in his words a balanced situation <e> <s> i submit that in order to secure a balanced situation steps must be taken in the bill to ensure that any arbitrator who is appointed is independent that is to say does not belong to one side or the other <e> <s> if that is accepted i must ask the minister whether if he does not agree to the present amendment he is prepared to consider another amendment which would ensure that the arbitrator is independent <e> <s> i ask that question because by such a provision we seek to achieve the objective which he himself has in mind a balanced situation <e>", "<cs> the minister must know that in many circumstances the position is not so easy as he has made out <e> <s> what happens is that there is a young man who is anxious to find a site for his caravan <e> <s> he has found work and he wants to find a site for his caravan <e> <s> he finds a site it is a suitable place the rent is not unreasonable and when he looks at the agreement he sees that mr x has been appointed as arbitrator <e> <s> he regards that as unimportant <e> <s> so far as he is concerned the main things have been agreed he wants to get on to the site and get to work <e> <s> he regards the name of the arbitrator as being of no account <e> <s> but if the bill remains as it is at the moment the person appointed could in fact be the agent of the site owner he could even be the brother-in-law of the site owner <e> <s> surely if the government want a balanced situation they should ensure by means of the bill that any arbitrator is in fact an independent arbitrator <e>", "<cs> but i must point out to the minister as my noble friend behind me has pointed out that over the years parliament has often taken the view that it is absolutely essential that the arbitrator agreed by the parties should have the approval of an authority concerned with arbitration <e> <s> the kind of provision that is contained in our amendment is already in many acts of parliament <e> <s> if parliament has decided that the provision has been necessary in previous acts why is it so absurd now as the minister is trying to imply <e>", "<cs> all we are trying to get from the minister is an assurance that there shall be an independent arbitrator <e> <s> if some other method of securing that objective is appropriate to scotland well and good <e> <s> we are not trying to force on the people of scotland something that they do not want that is a red herring <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the question of whether a house is sold a matter for the owner that is to say the charity organisation and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that many of us believe that workers in shops in the post office and in other non-essential industries should be able to enjoy their family life on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the congratulations to the minister on his well merited appointment as minister of state <e> <s> it is nice to know that he is valued outside this house as well as inside it <e> <s> i would plead with him on two points <e> <s> first during the further progress of the bill could consideration be given to taking steps to ensure the independence of the arbitrator <e> <s> by way of illustration let me take the case of a man who has had to move from one part of the country to another in order to find employment <e> <s> if he cannot obtain accommodation he gets a caravan as a last resort and eventually finds a place to park it <e> <s> that mans mind is going to be filled with so many urgent matters that he will give very little attention to the provision that is made in any agreement presented to him as to who is to be the arbitrator <e> <s> as matters stand at the moment an agreement presented by the owner of a site could have as its arbitrator a friend or even a relative of the landlord <e> <s> consequently it could be grossly unfair to the tenant who is not in such a strong bargaining position <e> <s> for my part i would like to see the rent officer serving as the arbitrator <e> <s> if some provision could be made to ensure greater independence without particular regard to any one proposal this would be a great step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first will the government resist any attempt made to uplift the commissions proposals for price increases in those commodities where there is already a considerable excess of production over consumption <e> <s> secondly will the minister bear in mind that an import of say per cent of cheap milk from the continent would be sufficient to drive many rounds off the road because it would make them unviable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer to my question and i put to him two supplementaries <e> <s> first of all were the universities acquainted with the targets that they were expected to meet <e> <s> at least one university says that it has been fined for something it knew nothing about <e> <s> second is it government policy to refuse admission to well qualified students just to meet a target <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saddened and dismayed by clause of this bill for several reasons <e> <s> first it shows how a political idea can become a dogma and be grossly overdone <e> <s> secondly it shows how very innocently parliamentary power can be abused <e> <s> none of us has a right to go back on a contract made years ago and insist upon changes being made changes that were never mentioned at the time when the contract was made <e> <s> that is just what the government are doing <e> <s> and to enable them to do it they are using the powers of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord ought to address his complaint to his own government and not to the electricity industry <e> <s> it is they who are using the electricity industry as a means of raising taxes <e>", "<cs> i should like to accept the challenge extended by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and state a logical case against this clause <e> <s> i will also in part reply to the noble lord lord sandford <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way because he has named me <e> <s> what i said was quite clear and concise <e> <s> i said that if the housing associations had to sell and they replaced with other assets at the present day costs then their costs and their rents would be greater <e> <s> nothing that the minister has said contradicts that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that many of us are concerned about our competitiveness as a nation <e> <s> if one took into account the cost of unemployment i doubt whether we are more competitive than we have been for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i first congratulate my noble friend lord gallacher on his maiden speech <e> <s> it was just right in length in content and in tone <e> <s> i have known my noble friend for years at relatively close quarters <e> <s> i believe that because of his personal qualities and his experience he can make a substantial contribution to the work of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are so much more competitive why is it that our figure for unemployment was only half a point more than the oecd figure in and is now per cent <e> <s> more <e> <s> that surely takes some explaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that may is mentioned in the question <e> <s> i assume the noble lord will agree that many of these by-passes were initiated by the previous government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but is he aware that from until the beginning of the present year the fall in inflation in the united kingdom was only one point more than it was for the oecd countries but our unemployment was four points greater than for the oecd countries <e> <s> does this not indicate that had the government used wisely all the measures available for restricting inflation they would have achieved their objective without so much hardship for our people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a large body of competent economists which believes that the most important factor causing our unemployment is the selection of methods of controlling inflation used by the government <e> <s> is this not supported by the very low rate of unemployment that we had in compared with oecd countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ask his right honourable and learned friend to bear in mind that both the employees and the employers in the distributive industry have asked for an inquiry before there is any radical change in shop law <e> <s> they believe that one should consider the long-term future <e> <s> both sides have promised to give the fullest co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister bear in mind two things <e> <s> first of all would he bear in mind that some of these undertakings that were nationalised were only nationalised when private ownership failed <e> <s> examples of this are british leyland and rolls-royce <e> <s> secondly would the minister bear in mind that there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the house generally is very pleased at his tolerance which is in accordance with the traditions of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is another debate to follow i shall rest content with congratulating my noble friend lord dean of beswick on a distinguished maiden speech and also my noble friend lord barnett on his first speech from the dispatch box which was indeed distinguished <e> <s> i also wish to thank all those who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> although i am not wholly happy that there has been the amount of agreement which i had expected i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider the french system where they have two separate producing units but joint retail units for both gas and electricity <e> <s> that would reduce unnecessary advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the heat engendered by this proposal <e> <s> it is very modest <e> <s> it does not try to take away any of the procedures of debate that we have at the moment <e> <s> at present it is possible to make a recommendation to the house that on such-and-such a day there will be two debates of two and a half hours each instead of a general debate without a time limit <e> <s> that is possible at the moment and it is done <e> <s> the proposal is merely that in addition to that it should be possible to propose that a debate be a five-hour debate and that would also need the formal approval of the house <e> <s> the house will decide not in general but on each occasion <e> <s> the proposal would never be put to the house without the support of the person moving the motion before the house <e> <s> whether it should be a five-hour debate or a debate without a time limit depends upon the subject <e> <s> we are merely proposing to have facilities available so that we can adopt one course or the other <e> <s> it is a very modest proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords in the s governments of both parties made great progress in very important consumer legislation <e> <s> can we have a guarantee from the government that they will take a positive attitude in trying to get these laws accepted by the community <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that one of the purposes of training is to reduce the experience necessary to reach proficiency and therefore experience ought to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that in future when there are statements they should be postponed until after the maiden speeches have been made in a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate my noble friend lord beswick not only on his motion but for the speech which he made in opening the debate <e> <s> it reminded me of some of the excellent speeches he made from the other side of the table when we were in office a very pleasant memory <e> <s> may i also say how much i welcome the abolition of the national insurance surcharge <e> <s> it was a tax upon jobs <e> <s> i do not expect immediate results from its abolition but in the long term i believe that it will be beneficial <e> <s> its abolition is a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister bear in mind that at such negotiations only employer and employee are represented <e> <s> this is a matter which is of the utmost importance to the consumers of this country and the government ought to be there at least putting the point of view of the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that underlying the objection to the closure of pits is the fear that local communities which are well knit together will be left without the means of livelihood <e> <s> the steel board did a great deal to promote alternative employment when it closed steel works <e> <s> what has the coal board done <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> is the minister aware that when a trade union takes the same view as the government are taking in regard to arbitration that trade union is condemned <e> <s> will the government consider a modified form of arbitration

has a great deal of influence <e> <s> when the local authority has to economise it circulates the spending committees and tells them they have to economise <e> <s> since the probation committee is a spending committee it would come under that pressure <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to take it away from that pressure for the reasons which have been given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that there is a contrary view <e> <s> there are certain things that need doing in this country and it is better to do them when we have people unemployed than when we have full employment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the government were quite candid and said we represent the owners of these industries and when intervention is necessary we will intervene there would be no need for any breach of loyalty <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that miners know from past experience that what happens in such circumstances is that work is found not for them but for their womenfolk <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the previous government did not have the advantage of million in oil taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that in the opinion of many people in all parties this would be an attack upon the poor and would have very little effect on employment <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that the committee which very recently considered shop hours found that the shop assistant was very lowly paid and strongly recommended to the government that they should maintain the wages councils <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago the leaders of our political parties had seen at first hand the misery and waste caused by the unemployment of the s <e> <s> they resolved that the greatest need of the british people was a high and stable level of employment <e> <s> and they acted accordingly <e> <s> for the first years after the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in spite of the wealth we have from the north sea our expenditure on the infrastructure compares very unfavourably with the other members of oecd <e>", "<cs> my lords before we close this matter will the noble and learned lord as a member of the government give us an assurance that there will be another occasion when we can ask more pertinent questions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the first essential in industrial relations is that both sides should be seeking agreement and not confrontation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for intervening in the gap but it will be for one minute <e> <s> i want to put a question to the minister which i hope he will be able to answer in his winding-up speech <e> <s> the bank will keep whatever the shareholders pay for their shares <e> <s> the bank will belong to the shareholders collectively <e> <s> therefore whatever the shareholders pay for their shares they will get the present bank as a gift <e> <s> that is i contend fair and logical reasoning and i invite the minister to fault it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will give way i may say that no matter what the shareholders pay they will get the present bank as a gift <e> <s> one can make the price whatever one likes because they will part with their money individually but will retain collective ownership of that money <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that many members of this house from all parties are interested in a high and stable level of employment <e> <s> if honda are prepared to take the risk then we welcome them <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> i should like to direct the attention of the committee to the fact that unless this bill is amended in this way it is going to set up a new body of shareholders who are going to get the bank as it is now given to them completely free of charge <e> <s> this is not privatisation it is daylight robbery <e> <s> the only purpose of this amendment is to reduce the amount of the loot <e>", "<cs> i made it quite clear that this is going beyond privatisation it is sheer daylight robbery <e> <s> we are giving the bank away to a new body of shareholders <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> surely the people who are supporting the bank at the moment namely the present depositors have a greater right than new shareholders who may have had nothing to do with the bank in the past <e>", "<cs> it does not belong to the government <e> <s> the government cannot hold on to it it does not belong to them <e>", "<cs> i must reply to some of the points that have been made by the minister <e> <s> first of all he admits that the argument which i placed before the committee is a question of fact <e> <s> he does not deny that <e> <s> he puts up as a counter-claim the point that there will be a difference between the base value of the shares and the market value and he assumes that the difference will be per cent <e> <s> in my case there was no assumption it was a question of fact to which he agreed <e> <s> his argument is based entirely upon an assumption of his own that that there will be a per cent <e> <s> difference between the market value and the base value of the shares <e>", "<cs> whatever is the amount it applies to the shares of all companies <e> <s> there is always a difference between the base value and the market value of shares but in the long run it is the base value that matters because that is the real value <e>", "<cs> in his argument the noble lord overlooked one point <e> <s> that is that at the present time the reserves can be used to the advantage of the depositors <e> <s> however in the future if there is ownership by shareholders they can decide who receives the benefit of the reserves the shareholders or the depositors <e> <s> the depositors will have no say whatever <e> <s> the shareholders will have the first word and the last <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made two points in reply to me <e> <s> i want to reply to both points <e>", "<cs> it is widely accepted throughout the world and not just in this country that there is a case for treating changes to the constitution differently from other changes to the law <e> <s> the point that has been <e>", "<cs> my lords in any consideration of local government in the shire counties will the government bear in mind that many of the powers which have gone to the shire counties have gone against the will of the people living in the urban areas and that there are many towns in the shire counties which could make quite as good a job of local government services as the boroughs in the metropolitan areas <e>", "<cs> i submit to the committee that there is a very strong case for keeping this service on something like a county basis <e> <s> there are three reasons for that <e> <s> first of all in the past decade there have been enormous changes in testing <e> <s> those changes have given rise to the use of a very much greater amount of technique and expertise <e> <s> secondly they have also given rise to the use of improved testing equipment <e> <s> it has now reached the stage when more or less the only people who can afford to employ the expertise and use the equipment are the metropolitan counties because of their substantial rateable value base <e> <s> those changes have taken place since the last change in local government <e> <s> i believe the government are losing sight of that <e> <s> at the present time it is recognised in the whole profession that the metropolitan counties are ahead of everybody else so much so that the other counties are using the metropolitan counites service in many of the checks that they are making <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and since he has mentioned my name i should like him to reply to this comment <e> <s> the government by this bill are abolishing the glc and the metropolitan county councils <e> <s> they are suggesting in the bill that the functions which they performed should go partly to the boroughs partly to quangos partly to joint committees partly to central government and so on <e> <s> the committee is suggesting improvements and different ways in which that can be done <e> <s> that is a function of this house <e>", "<cs> we are being consistent in continuing to seek improvement of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that our people expect the government to show an example as an employer an example of the best <e> <s> where there is failure to agree wages will the government consider submitting the whole matter to pendulum arbitration <e> <s> this is something of which we need experience <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister tells us that we cannot be sure that we have got it right surely he must realise that that applies to almost every bill that comes before this house <e> <s> it does not apply only to this bill or to a few bills it applies to almost every bill <e> <s> we cannot be sure that we have got it right and because we cannot be sure have we to put reserve powers in every bill so that it can be changed quickly <e> <s> surely this is nonsense <e> <s> this is a phoney argument <e> <s> the minister must know that if there is a case for avoiding reserve powers it must be where it concernss the organisation of the police <e> <s> that is something which ought to be done by primary legislation <e> <s> i have never seen such a poor case put to the house against any particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> at the last stage i moved an amendment which would provide that for every shares sold one should be allocated to charities and that the income from the shares should be administered by trustees appointed by the directors of the trustee savings banks <e> <s> i should like to thank all those members of your lordships house who supported me on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the auld committee strongly recommended that the wages councils should be maintained in retail distribution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that earlier this year the national institute of economic and social research published the results of some research on the differences between west german companies and british companies <e> <s> they took companies of the same size doing almost the same thing <e> <s> in the case of germany the productivity was per cent <e> <s> higher <e> <s> among the reasons which they found for that was a complete lack of training in the british for example in the case of foremen <e> <s> is the minister aware that the results showed that not a single foreman in the british companies had a certificate for craft qualifications whereas in the case of the german companies every one of the foremen had a craft certificate and some of them had a master craftsmans certificate <e> <s> there is the point and the sooner we get down to it the better <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not the cost of confrontation <e> <s> could we not have saved the taxpayer some money if there had been a modicum of tact and a little conciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not another case of confrontation at very high cost <e> <s> and in this case the cost is being borne by the children <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that to get lower unit costs there are many things which ought to take priority over low wages <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord wolfson and the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not accept and i speak from personal experience that in the past it has been the experience that the kind of employment which has become available in the right reverend prelates diocese has been quite unsuitable for those who have been out of work there <e> <s> in most cases the type of employment available in the north-east is not suitable for out-of-work miners but is for their wives or daughters <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment so ably moved by the right reverend prelate and i would remind the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that i speak as a practical man who has served retail management for practically the whole of this working life <e> <s> i support the amendment first because i think that it is more in keeping with the evidence received by the auld committee than its report <e> <s> no one can say that its findings correspond with the evidence that it received <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not speaking for anybody other than myself and certainly not for whoever wrote the pamphlet <e> <s> and i cannot see the justification for that interruption <e>", "<cs> i challenge the statement that this is an abuse of parliamentary procedure <e> <s> that is nonsense <e> <s> what happened was that at second reading there was an amendment that the motion should be qualified <e> <s> many who voted against that amendment did so because they thought that it was not the time to make the qualification and that once the bill had been agreed in principle there would at a later stage be an opportunity of considering the details in the bill and making amendments to it <e> <s> that is normal practice <e> <s> it is nothing to do with abuse of parliamentary procedure <e>", "<cs> is the minister suggesting that every country in europe except sweden is wise enough and able enough to make some regulations but we are not <e>", "<cs> the minister has got me entirely wrong <e> <s> i said that there was regulation in all countries in europe except sweden <e> <s> i am therefore ignoring sweden <e> <s> i then put a question to the minister <e> <s> is the minister saying that all these countries except sweden are able to regulate sunday trading but that we are not able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank everybody who has taken part in the debate <e> <s> it has been a worthwhile debate although i am disappointed with the reply of the minister <e> <s> we do not get anywhere <e> <s> we are getting the same kind of reply as we always get <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that to those acquainted with retailing the gross profits of these shops appears scandalous and in no way competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that in a period of high unemployment mobility of labour is exceptionally important that that can best be fostered by rented property and that the local authorities are best able to provide that as long as they are given the necessary finance <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble and learned lord will give way <e> <s> he is surely aware that liquor is governed by the acts relating to the licensing laws <e> <s> that has nothing whatever to do with the shops act <e>", "<cs> i shall reply only on the issue of polls <e> <s> the co-operative union did not take its own poll it engaged a research company to do it <e> <s> among the many figures which have been revealed by the research company we have these few which i shall give to the committee <e> <s> first only per cent <e> <s> wanted full deregulation on sunday <e> <s> secondly per cent <e> <s> were against any change whatever in the law relating to sunday trading <e> <s> thirdly per cent <e> <s> were in favour of sunday morning only <e> <s> they felt there should be change but on sunday morning only <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that the figures which i have put in the question are taken from a table produced by phillips and drew <e> <s> if the minister so wishes i shall send him a copy of the table from which my calculations were made <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that so long as we have this kind of return on equities and the kind of increases in top salaries that we had last year the government can expect applications for substantial increases in wages from all conscientious leaders of trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the government have set their sights on the wrong target <e> <s> if we want lower wages costs we must have both lower profits and lower increases in high salaries <e> <s> there must be leadership <e> <s> what happens at the top is copied lower down and anyone who has been concerned with leadership knows that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would suggest to the noble baroness that she is overlooking one important point <e> <s> the vast majority of shopworkers are not members of a trade union and they are not used to negotiating with employers <e> <s> they are not acquainted with the fact that if the employer says will you work on a sunday <e> <s> they can ask for a trial period <e> <s> however if it was in the statute it would be different <e> <s> they need this protection of a trial period because they are not represented by a trade union and they are not used to negotiating <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a mistaken quotation <e> <s> it means and everybody recognises this except the noble and learned lord that amendments that have been before the house or a committee of the house at a previous stage should not come back at third reading <e> <s> that is the limit of what it means and that is not what has happened <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is stretching the standing order to further his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beloff told us that he thought that the european convention should not interfere in what is a domestic matter <e> <s> i am inclined to agree with that <e> <s> i believe that by charter and convention we have in europe placed more restrictions on individual states than the federal government do in america <e> <s> in america several matters are left to the states whereas we try to inhibit <e>", "<cs> in england and wales and presumably in scotland the charitable housing association is quite different from a local authority <e> <s> the local authority is part of government <e> <s> it is responsible to the community as a whole and in addition it is inhibited by a waiting list <e> <s> but a charitable housing association is not part of government <e> <s> it is an association of individuals who wish to provide housing for rent where they see a need and very often they have at least in part financed the whole matter by making cheap loans and cheap share capital available to the association <e> <s> furthermore in almost every association there is a great deal of voluntary service for which the association never pays <e> <s> this is part of the charity <e> <s> presumably the position in scotland is the same as that in england and wales but i can assure the committee that in england and wales the whole of the finance for these houses was not provided by government <e> <s> some of the finance was provided by the shareholders of the charitable housing association and their purpose was to build houses to rent <e>", "<cs> not the charitable housing associations <e> <s> that was thrown out by your lordships house <e>", "<cs> we have told the noble lord why <e>", "<cs> that is a comment made up by the scottish office which just does not know what the position is in england and wales <e> <s> the position in england and wales is that the tenant of the charitable housing association does not have a right to buy because that was rejected by this house <e> <s> a charitable housing association in scotland is very much the same as a charitable housing association in england <e> <s> they are the smaller housing associations to which people other than the government have contributed money <e> <s> i cannot accept this distinction which has now been created by the scottish office <e>", "<cs> may i put this specific question to the minister let us assume that the fault is nothing to do with an appliance or with general distribution but rather with a leak in a pipe under the floor of a house <e> <s> in that case presumably the gas supplier has a duty to stop the leak and to do half an hours free work to repair it <e> <s> but after that is it the responsibility of the householder <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that i use the southern network daily and i can say that the services particularly between my station westminster and london have improved immensely and are not likely to be further improved by any idea of privatisation <e>", "<cs> for too long consumers have suffered from the monopoly charges inflicted by solicitors for conveyancing charges based upon the value of the property and not upon the work that is being done <e> <s> the only excuse we have had for this charge in recent years is that it creates a fund from which there can be a cost subsidy to other work done by the solicitors <e> <s> that may be so but that is not the way in which the public should be charged <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lords objection to this amendment simply that it is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> what is the evidence that a statutory panel would not do the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that what we need in particular is more and more training of a high standard in which there is the discipline of an examination which is recognised by employers for which they pay a premium <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it this amendment seeks to defer action and says that action will be taken only if the secretary of state finds it necessary <e> <s> we therefore think that this is the time to do that <e> <s> the time for action may be later <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that there are people in all parties who believe that the best way of preventing abuse of unemployment benefit is to guarantee employment after a given period of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise two questions <e> <s> today it is common practice for employers to have service contracts with their employees providing that in the case of men the normal retirement age will be and in the case of women <e> <s> this bill gives such employers one year in which to put their house in order <e> <s> there is therefore an interim period <e> <s> however some of these employers are already defendants at industrial tribunals <e> <s> they have been <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have an answer to the questions i have put <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for opportunities of employment for persons unemployed for periods of time and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> all my life i have belonged to a consumer movement and naturally i believe that if a consumer suffers because of defects in a product he should be compensated whether there is negligence or not and whether it could have been foreseen or not <e> <s> i also believe that the manufacturer and the whole body of consumers who ultimately pay should not have unlimited liability <e> <s> i believe there should be a great limit on their liability <e> <s> i therefore not merely support amendment no <e> <s> but i also strongly support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> indeed i would go much further than amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe that the limits of liability should be far greater than they are in that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the employment of the present long-term unemployed on building houses would be far better for the nation than paying the colossal sums now paid to hotels for bed and breakfast accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to our rate of unemployment and the considerable disparity between the regions is this not information which ought to be available for the guidance of both the government and parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i must remind the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the minister that he has not answered my supplementary question <e> <s> will he have another look at it and please answer the supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall restrict my reply to two or three minutes in order that the next debate can proceed

objected to was the hostility shown to the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to the minister that he has quoted beveridge entirely out of context <e> <s> beveridge assumed that there was full employment and that people received wages out of which they could save <e> <s> he would have been appalled by the mass unemployment that we have today <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a strong current of public opinion which feels that more should be spent on the health service even if less money has to be spent on something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his very sympathetic reply and also for his congratulations on my birthday <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord aware that an increasing number of house buyers are finding themselves sitting on the doorstep of the home they have bought because there has been some hitch along the chain in completion <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord also aware that that can be overcome by a code of practice sponsored by the government and agreed with the local authorities and the professional bodies concerned <e> <s> i can speak on this matter from personal and first-hand experience <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor aware that i do not suggest that a code of practice would solve the whole question of chains <e> <s> however i believe that a code of practice would prevent the absurdity of people sitting on the doorstep of their new home for two or three hours unnecessarily <e>", "<cs> i am one of those who has taken a very close interest in the trade union movement from the outside <e> <s> i have always been a member of a union but i have never taken an active part in a union <e> <s> my job was to manage a business <e> <s> i spent a lifetime doing that <e> <s> i feel that in this matter the government are wrong in

accept that the executive should be elected but we are talking about people who are not members of the executive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many people who have given long service to building societies are disturbed by the developments of recent years because they believe that the success of building societies has been due to their specialisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> perhaps i may put to him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first the working party declined to state any view on the subject of compulsion <e> <s>

obligations <e> <s> will the would-be freeholders be able to seek compulsory purchase <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> is it wise to provide for the conversion of a building society into a company when reasonable compensation to existing members can undermine the financial strength of the institution <e> <s> secondly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the policy of the government apparently has been to control inflation but that their first priority has been the reduction of direct taxation regardless of the effect upon inflation <e> <s> one can go back to the increase in vat and the reduction in direct taxation to support that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a service in which we should seek to have conciliation or
