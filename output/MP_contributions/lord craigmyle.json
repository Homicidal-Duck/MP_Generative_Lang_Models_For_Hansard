["<cs> this is the only part of the bill which amends section of the principal act <e> <s> it occurred to me to raise the question as to whether section is really necessary at all <e> <s> the amendments which we were considering a few minutes ago seem to indicate quite clearly that it is very difficult indeed to separate completely assessment from treatment <e> <s> if that is so then the whole point of admission for assessment only seems to lose its validity <e> <s> the other point that strikes me is that in the equivalent scottish act there is nothing to match section <e> <s> there is no admission for assessment procedure at all <e> <s> if we do not need it in scotland why do they need it in england and wales <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i was much interested in what the minister said <e> <s> i do not think i can guarantee not to return to the charge at a later date but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords so able and all-inclusive have been the speeches made already in this debate that i am at a loss to know what to say except that i profoundly agree with almost everything that has been said by the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester my noble friend the duke of norfolk and the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> is what the noble and learned lord trying to do really so obscure <e> <s> the law at the moment is doubtful <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has told us clearly what he thinks courts would do <e> <s> but the bill as at present drafted talks about <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support this amendment <e> <s> it is sometimes represented that surrogacy is really a sophisticated form of adoption and adoption is perfectly normal and legal so why should surrogacy not be so <e> <s> the noble baroness was much nearer the truth when she referred to the unhappy practices in the th century among them the practice of baby farming <e> <s> to my mind surrogacy is a sophisticated version not of adoption but of baby farming and since baby farming is illegal so then should be surrogacy <e> <s> if we have it stated that for all purposes of law the lawful child is the child of the mother who bears it this will be very much clearer <e> <s> if the mother then wishes to go through with the surrogacy arrangements that she may have made i hope unofficially she can go via the procedure of adoption <e> <s> there is nothing to stop her from doing that it would be a perfectly normal thing to do <e> <s> but the childs benefit must come first <e> <s> if the mother wishes to retain the child then the childs benefit would seem to lie in allowing the mother to retain it <e> <s> one perfectly natural reason is that the mother who bore it will be lactating and the sponsoring mother will not <e> <s> these are some of the considerations which lead me to support the amendment of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> before we wave a cheerful farewell to clause which after all is the main clause of the bill i believe it would be right to say a few more words about commercial and non-commercial agencies <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will look at amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall be coming in a moment and to which we have already agreed there is at the top of page of the marshalled list a definition of track which is almost identical to the one which we are now deleting <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to listen to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i find myself in strong agreement with almost everything that he has said <e> <s> i need hardly say more by way of introduction than join with all noble lords who have spoken and i am sure those who have not spoken in thanking the government for giving the house the opportunity of debating the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although we are accustomed to short speeches i am very happy that that has not caused us to drop the custom of first of all thanking the noble lord who opened the debate and congratulating a maiden speaker <e> <s> all i can say to the right reverend prelate is to remind him that chelmsford is not very far from westminster and i hope that he will be with us frequently <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a refreshing speech from the noble lord the chief rabbi and it makes me sorry that i was not in my place on the occasion of his maiden speech <e> <s> my original idea in speaking today was to simplify matters a bit <e> <s> i believe that what the right reverend dr hugh montefiore had in mind was that if those who drafted the infant life preservation act had been working in instead of in they would not have put a time limit of weeks in the bill <e> <s> probably they would have put a time limit of weeks <e> <s> however much water has flowed under the bridge since then <e> <s> the bill is dead and all we can do today is to bury it <e>", "<cs> the definition is extremely important <e> <s> i am entirely behind the principle of the amendment but i cannot pretend to like the wording <e> <s> the definition is at once both too narrow and too loose <e> <s> it does not describe sufficiently clearly the people who are to be covered by it <e> <s> it seems based on the assumption that community service volunteers are the only such people <e> <s> in practice i do not think that that will be found to be so <e> <s> in a few minutes when we consider amendment no <e> <s> we shall be considering religious communities many of whom will have working with them just such volunteers who are not members of the religious community and will therefore not come within the definition in amendment no <e> <s> but who are very definitely the kind of people whom the noble baroness and her co-signatories to this amendment have in mind <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has been bombarded with all sorts of questions about this but they are all questions around the periphery of the matter <e> <s> i am sure that members of the committee would not wish him to receive the impression that we are all carping at him <e> <s> we are all grateful as i am sure are all religious communities throughout the land for the introduction of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entirely correct <e> <s> that mood concerning food air and water is becoming very strong <e> <s> i believe that he and the noble lord lord monson should be supported particularly on the aspect of the question which <e>", "<cs> i am very hesitant to become involved in the debate because unfortunately i was not able to be present for the second reading of the bill because i was in tanzania visiting a medical mission <e> <s> that was a worthwhile reason for being absent but my absence means that i am somewhat out of date as regards the way the debate has flowed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord recognises that this is a difficult situation <e> <s> however the difficulty arises from what is now common knowledge <e> <s> within the psyche of everyone is a longing to understand ones origins where did i come from how am i here who are my parents <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a strange but vitally important point <e> <s> moreover this is the appropriate forum in which it should be considered as it concerns many of your lordships families <e> <s> it appears that every claimant to a peerage will have to be vetted in the way suggested by the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge <e> <s> but further matters also arise <e>"]
