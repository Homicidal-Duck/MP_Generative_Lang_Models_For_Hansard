["<cs> my lords we should like to thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> we join with her in her thanks to mrs warnock and her committee and congratulate them on their very comprehensive and human report <e> <s> we too welcome the change in the definition and the new term children with learning difficulties <e> <s> the minister said that the report would be <e>", "<cs> surely each local authority would send up its articles of government for approval <e> <s> individual schools would not send them up <e> <s> it would be only <e>", "<cs> i should like to say at once that the aim in putting forward the amendment is not to gain greater control but to give a higher status to the primary schools and to stop the differentiation between secondary and primary <e> <s> my noble friend lady wootton of abinger put that point extremely well <e> <s> the minister said that there will be no changes at this time as if the government might be thinking about changes in the future but surely now when the bill is going through is the time to make the change <e> <s> there are major advances in the bill <e> <s> indeed many of the clauses are the same as clauses in the labour bill which fell at the dissolution and i am glad that there are a good many matters on which we all agree <e> <s> the minister says that the government recognise the great importance of the primary schools <e> <s> so why not take this final step and let us have deeds not words <e> <s> i am going to press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> speaking from the opposition front bench i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think it is necessary that these schools should have the same sort of representation and i hope that the minister when replying will not say that it is going to be very difficult to appoint parents and so on <e> <s> it may be sometimes if it is a non-maintained <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a slight misunderstanding <e> <s> if governors are appointed by the local education authority they do not have to be members of that body <e> <s> they are representatives of that body and they can be chosen from anywhere <e> <s> obviously you could not have education committee members on every <e>", "<cs> may i say one thing about governing bodies <e> <s> i mentioned in my first amendment that if you have too many people say half of them not representative of the lea you will have a lot of governors who do not know what the position is about finance and so on <e> <s> they may well be passing resolutions we would like to have another language taught or we would like to have the heating improved or we would like to have new curtains <e> <s> they may pass resolutions about any number of things which will be taken no heed of at all <e> <s> the local authority representatives should know what the position is they should be truly representative but not necessarily members of the education committee or of the council <e> <s> i think there is a misunderstanding about who are representative and what representatives should do <e>", "<cs> one of the reasons for this amendment relates to points which will arise in later clauses in the bill <e> <s> if this bill is passed children will find it very much easier to get places in schools that are not in their own authority area <e> <s> it was for that reason that we thought it right to table this amendment <e> <s> after the bill becomes law the situation will be very different from that which exists now <e>", "<cs> we are not asking for every governing body to have all these people <e> <s> it depends on the area <e> <s> in some areas there would be one and in other areas another <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the representatives from the local authority can provide some of the places for these people <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree with her noble friend that she ought to take this amendment back and bring it forward again better worded <e> <s> i admit it is not perfect <e> <s> if she would take it back and give us an assurance that such an amendment will come before us at report stage we will not press this amendment now <e> <s> but if we do not have that assurance we shall certainly press the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i do not know whether he was in the chamber when the noble baroness lady seear said that she and her colleagues would not press their amendment to our amendment no <e> <s> if we were to press ours that they accepted ours rather than theirs <e>", "<cs> i said that this was a probing amendment and i shall withdraw it <e>", "<cs> with that explanation i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> how long after the child has left will that governor remain in the job <e>", "<cs> with the ministers offer i will agree to withdraw the amendment now and if i am not satisfied with her letter i shall have a chance to come back on report <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much <e> <s> in fact it was my mistake <e> <s> i have a note on my amendment covered already and it was covered by the statement of the minister to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and not by the earlier statement to me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely amazed at the negative attitude of the members on the benches opposite <e> <s> we have got a new education bill and we want to do something with it <e> <s> to say that everything is all right thank you is not good enough <e> <s> we have had no new arguments against this amendment which were not offered against amendment no <e> <s> which we put forward <e> <s> it is quite extraordinary that this amendment cannot be accepted by the government <e>", "<cs> noble lords will have noticed and indeed it has been mentioned that i am a signatory to amendment no <e> <s> which covers quite a lot of the same ground that we have been debating <e> <s> i would be very willing to accept that this amendment is more flexible and better worded so if the other signatories to amendment no <e> <s> are willing would certainly withdraw that <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness answers that i should like to ask a question <e> <s> i understand from what she said before and also when we had a <e>", "<cs> i think one of the reasons for having teacher governors was that they could say something which the head would not say <e> <s> it was particularly to get a different viewpoint from that of the headmaster or headmistress <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words in favour of the amendment which has had a rather cool reception from certain quarters <e> <s> i have been a member of a governing body which included pupil governors and it worked extremely well <e> <s> they were usually a bit shy to start with but then they warmed up and were extremely interesting <e> <s> with regard to what the noble lord lord taylor said and the point about the legal rights i remember that there were problems when it was decided to have pupil governors but the matter was discussed with great care <e> <s> i cannot quite remember what the solution was but the legal department of the county council agreed that it was all right to have pupil governors and there has not been any trouble <e>", "<cs> that is the wrong part of the bill <e>", "<cs> having listened to the views expressed by the committee i <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not satisfied with the ministers answer <e> <s> i may appear rather distrustful of the governments intentions but i feel that there is quite a let-out here and so i should like to press my amendment <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i am not really satisfied with the answer from the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> i think it could lead to a good deal of ill-feeling between the various schools if they do not each have a parent and a teacher <e> <s> if they have rather big governing bodies to start with by having three parents and three teachers perhaps that will encourage them to hurry up with their arrangements for having separate governing bodies and therefore i should like to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble lord because i think i have the answeror indeed the noble viscount lord ridley could give it <e> <s> it is i think the acc and the ama <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i answer a few of the things that have been said about my speech <e> <s> the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith and the noble lord lord janner did not quite listen to what i said <e> <s> i said that if agreements have been reached between the authorities involved such arrangements would be permissible given the terms of the amendment <e> <s> that refers among other things to children wishing to cross boundaries in order to go to a denominational school of their choice <e> <s> the only thing is that under this bill they may be able to go to the school provided they can pay the fare to get there <e> <s> under my amendment there would be nothing to stop parents choosing a denominational school not within their own boundaries <e> <s> my noble friend lady jeger mentioned the point about children being very close to a boundary and a school across the boundary being very much more convenient <e> <s> that would be dealt with in the same wayagreements are reached between local authorities <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i did deal with that point <e> <s> i said that arrangements can he made to deal with that and my amendment would not prevent that <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i think that i shall save my fire for clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the phrases the provision of efficient education and the efficient use of resources are extremely vague <e> <s> i do not know how they will be interpreted by the appeals committee if and when it is set up but i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness then prepared to let some schools keep full and let the numbers in others drop substantially <e> <s> what will happen about the staffing <e> <s> will they be able to keep staff to teach a couple of foreign languages and science subjects <e> <s> how does she imagine that the authorities will cope with that situation <e>", "<cs> actually i do <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> we have not really had an answer from her about what she intends to do <e> <s> is she worried about the schools which will lose numbers <e> <s> will extra funds be given to the local authorities which are experiencing great problems in this regard <e> <s> i have asked her this question before <e> <s> she is very interested in the curriculum and mentions it often <e> <s> presumably where numbers are dropping substantially she would like the schools to have all the necessary staff <e> <s> will they be particularly well staffed <e> <s> will local authorities be given more money in their rate support grant to help these schools if they are really getting down on numbers <e> <s> what does she intend to do <e> <s> what does she think will happen when some schools are over full and others are left empty <e> <s> what about the education of the children in those schools <e> <s> those are the matters about which i do not think that we have had an answer <e>", "<cs> but they are very difficult to define <e>", "<cs> i have been looking forward to debating this clause because we have been hearing constantly from the government benches that their whole aim in this bill is to give local education authorities greater freedom to do what they like and to manage their own affairs <e> <s> but here we have pages telling them exactly what they have to do and exactly how they have got to set up their appeal committees at enormous expense <e> <s> as lord alexander said we understand that one of the reasons for this bill is economy and i am really amazed at what the government are doing here <e>", "<cs> i wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> what i think of this clause must be quite clear from what i said earlier and really it is an absolute nonsense particularly when considered within the philosophy of the party opposite <e> <s> i should like to say a few words on the reference to tribunals which think is in subsection <e> <s> i refrained from moving my amendment on this because i intended to speak on leaving out the clause <e> <s> it is absolutely ridiculous to involve the tribunals and inquiries act and to put the appeal committee under the supervision of the council on tribunals this smacks of lawyers and it seems to me that lawyers who do not have much connection with work on the ground in local authorities must have concocted this clause and the schedule <e> <s> i feel very strongly that it over-inflates the whole <e>", "<cs> i have many answers for the noble baroness but i shall refrain from making them at this hour <e> <s> i wish to press this to a vote now <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak on leaving out schedule but i do not think that i need to say very much about it <e> <s> dislike of the clause and even more so of the schedule has probably been made clear even though we have not moved our amendments <e>", "<cs> but most of them have already done it <e> <s> north yorkshire has <e> <s> cambridge has <e> <s> it has worked very well <e> <s> i did not quote cambridge before because i thought it was a pity to quote the authority which i had served <e> <s> i preferred to quote north yorkshire <e> <s> in the four years during which i served on the appeal committee i think we had one appeal only to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> if the minister thinks that the examination results are to he published will this be the job of the local education authorities because that would be more acceptable than if it were done by individual schools and heads and so on <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend would like to come in when we reach clause <e> <s> i think he will want to talk on that topic <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether happy but i will at any rate for the moment beg leave to withdraw the amendment and think about it possibly for report <e>", "<cs> i do want the information to be published <e>", "<cs> i shall agree to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there are a number of very small schools where the per cent <e> <s> figure would cause difficulty and i shall be surprised if we do not have one of our welsh noble friends speaking because i understand that there are more of these really small primary schools in wales than elsewhere in the country <e> <s> i also hope that in this case the government might feel that they can give way <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i did not say it would get bad chemistry resultsi said they probably would not be able to teach chemistry <e>", "<cs> we have <e>", "<cs> i have not either <e> <s> we have strayed into the clause stand part debate already and we should try to bring ourselves back to the amendment <e> <s> what i want to do is to ask the minister a specific question about fees <e> <s> is it true that the government have not yet decided the maximum fee that they are going to pay per year for these children <e> <s> i ask that because at this stage after the bill has been through the other place and we are now at the committee stage if they have not yet decided on the figure they really ought to have done <e> <s> so i should like to know what it is and if they have not decided when they are going to do so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would answer my specific question before we do that <e>", "<cs> yes i understand that <e>", "<cs> we on these benches will be supporting the noble duke the duke of norfolk and the noble lord lord butler in opposing this clause <e> <s> before i actually get down to the clause i should like to clear up one or two things the minister said about the last government <e> <s> she said that they too were anxious about the costs of transport in the country and the present situation <e> <s> i think everyone has thought for some time that it was rather ridiculous to have the two-mile limit and the three-mile limit <e> <s> it is perfectly possible to make <e>", "<cs> the parents may choose to pay <e> <s> one can get three miles <e> <s> on a bicycle it is very easy to get three miles although it is very dangerous <e> <s> that is one of the troubles about the charges <e> <s> the children will probably be forced more on to bikes and to walking in order to save money and i believe the traffic dangers are going to he considerable <e> <s> this was not the case of course some time ago when there was very much less traffic <e> <s> in fact <e> <s> there was very little indeed in because petrol rationing was still going on but what is going to happen as a result of this clause will he appalling <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness lady faithfull i am rather surprised by what she said whether she agrees with the present prime ministers desire which she expressed in <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble baroness with great interest <e> <s> i am going to divide the committee on this but i presume that if i lose this i will have her support on my amendment to clause where there will be extra help for the play groups and day nurseries <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene the duty is there it is not putting it on them <e>", "<cs> i shall look forward to hearing what the minister says in reply <e> <s> i had thought that a nursery school could be established in the premises of primary schools <e> <s> i now have an interes <e>", "<cs> i am absolutely delighted about some of the things that the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i am with her on experiment innovation the opportunities that there will be with empty rooms in primary schools and so on <e> <s> i am glad that she reminded me of the warnock report because of course she has said <e>", "<cs> i want to get this clear <e> <s> section may say that <e> <s> i think that was the section that the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> what i want to know is that the government have no intention of altering the law and bringing in anything in the future that will enable charges to be made <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am entirely satisfied <e> <s> what i am prepared to do is to withdraw the amendment for now but give notice if this is something that i can do that as i have not had a satisfactory answer i shall bring it back on report <e>", "<cs> i feel that the debate we had on amendment no <e> <s> really covered the whole issue and i think it would be unnecessary to have it again and to divide as i should have liked to do <e>", "<cs> while i cannot accept that if these teachers were appointed any particular one would always be going to a day nursery for i imagine that there would be flexible arrangements in the light of what the minister has said i am prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question of the minister before we finish with this clause <e> <s> subsections and give very sweeping powers to the secretary of state and regulations are mentioned in both cases <e> <s> i should like to know where the regional advisory councils come in this is particularly to do with subsection and how much consultation there will be before these regulations are made <e>", "<cs> i was not referring to subsection but to subsections and and i was asking as regards the rather sweeping powers which seem to have been given to the secretary of state what was the position of the regional advisory councils <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her explanation <e>", "<cs> may i just add one point before the minister replies because <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister has recognised and admitted the anomaly and i hope that perhaps she will think about how it can be remedied <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my voice in support of this amendment <e> <s> the proposals of the oakes committee had a good deal of support although there were some reservations <e> <s> the national body which is suggested is not exactly like the oakes proposals in detail but we feel very strongly that there should be some body comparable to the ugc <e> <s> i hope that whatever body is set up will have some sort of links with the ugc so that provision of higher education over the country is looked at as a whole and not in two completely separate departments <e>", "<cs> the point is not that the expenditure should not be looked at and possibly reduced but the way that the cut is arranged between institutions <e> <s> we arc objecting to the arbitrary nature and the crude method of making the cuts <e>"]
