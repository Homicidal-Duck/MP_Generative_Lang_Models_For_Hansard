minister agree though that there is a need for an overall look at all post-school education <e> <s> we are going to be in a very different society in the next few years and a completely new look with a broader outlook than that of the old non-vocational adult education is <e>", "<cs> would not the minister my lords think that some quite new and imaginative look should be taken at this area or is the department of education going to leave it to other agencies such as the manpower services commission and the department of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords this untimely and ill-conceived bill has aroused the hostility of the local authority associations the society of education officers the teachers the parents and even the national farmers union and a good deal of the press neither of the last two usually so critical of tory policies <e> <s> the churches and even some members of the tory party are opposed to some parts of the bill <e> <s> so noble lords will not be surprised to hear that it has aroused the anger and dismay of members on these benches and i suspect some members sitting on other benches too <e> <s> the weight of public opinion has obliged the government already to modify some of their proposals i hope that opinions expressed here today may influence them to make further changes and indeed that they will have the courage to remove some of the more hurtful clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way for a second <e> <s> would she not agree that falling rolls very often cause much greater difficulty in schools in that they cannot make

have new curtains <e> <s> they may pass resolutions about any number of things which will be taken no heed of at all <e> <s> the local authority representatives should know what the position is they should be truly representative but not necessarily members of the education committee or of the council <e> <s> i think there is a misunderstanding about who are representative and what representatives should do <e>", "<cs> one of the reasons for this amendment relates to points which will arise in later clauses in the bill <e> <s> if this bill is passed children will find it very much easier to get places in schools that are not in their own authority area <e> <s> it was for that reason that we thought it right to table this amendment <e> <s> after the bill becomes law the

would be one and in other areas another <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the representatives from the local authority can provide some of the places for these people <e>", "<cs> does the minister

could say something which the head would not say <e> <s> it was particularly to get a different viewpoint from that of the headmaster or headmistress <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words in favour of the amendment which has had a rather cool reception from certain quarters <e> <s> i have been a member of a governing body which included pupil governors and it worked extremely well <e> <s> they were usually a bit shy to start with but then they warmed up and were extremely interesting <e> <s> with regard to what the noble lord lord taylor said and the point about the legal rights i remember that there were problems when it was decided to have pupil governors but the matter was discussed with great care <e> <s> i cannot quite remember what the solution was but the legal department of the

good deal of ill-feeling between the various schools if they do not each have a parent and a teacher <e> <s> if they have rather big governing bodies to start with by having three parents and three teachers perhaps that will encourage them to hurry up with their arrangements for having separate governing bodies and therefore i should like to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble lord because i think i have the answeror indeed the noble viscount lord ridley could give it <e> <s> it is i think the acc and the ama <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i answer a few of the things that have been said about my speech <e> <s> the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith and the noble lord lord janner did not quite listen to what i said <e> <s> i said that if agreements have been reached between the authorities involved such arrangements would be permissible given the terms of the amendment <e> <s> that refers among other things to children wishing to cross boundaries in order to go to a denominational school of their choice <e> <s> the only thing is that under this bill they may be able to go to the school provided they can pay the fare to get there <e>

being very close to a boundary and a school across the boundary being very much more convenient <e> <s> that would be dealt with in the same wayagreements are reached between local authorities <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i did deal with that point <e> <s> i said that arrangements can he made to deal with that and my amendment would not prevent that <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i think

extremely vague <e> <s> i do not know how they will be interpreted by the appeals committee if and when it is set up but i shall not press this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness then prepared to let some schools keep full and let the numbers in others drop substantially <e> <s> what will happen about the staffing <e> <s> will they be able to

of office of governors and i can be given that assurance i would be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would venture to suggest that it is not <e> <s> we are not specifying who is to be on the board <e> <s> we are suggesting guidelines <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> my lords with some of those assurances i hope they will be kept and that there will not be much grouping i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> the minister refers to articles of government setting out the duties of governors but it has now been decided that the primary schools articles of government will not be looked at by the department and so the minister will not know what is to be included there <e> <s> is the department going to send out model articles of government <e> <s> because there are to be a great many new governing bodies for primary schools <e> <s> i believe that quite a number of these schools do not have governing bodies or managing bodies at the moment and there will be many new governors who will be wondering what they are supposed to be doing <e> <s> so may i ask the minister what guidance there is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the choice which does remain in fact is a cloice between comprehensive and secondary modern schools and that is it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word about paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords if the decision of the appeal committee is binding also on the parent and we were not at all clear on that point would it not be a good idea to put it into the bill so that it will be clear to everybody <e> <s> is the minister willing to table an amendment of that sort on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just one comment <e> <s> when i was a member of an appeal committee of which i have spoken before at second reading we did not have people from outside the authority as members of it but we did insist on having a parent of a child attending a maintained school and we managed to find that parent from among the local authority members <e> <s> i should have thought that was also a possibility and that this amendment would have allowed for that as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely appalled that everyone who has spoken seems to be looking on this as a court of law where people might be fined or sent to jail <e> <s> this is simply a case of deciding to which school a child should go <e> <s> i still think that it would be appalling if lawyers were involved <e> <s> i am all for a friend being allowed to attend and a friend can take various shapes or forms presumably the friend might even be the husband or wife of the parent who is speaking most of the time <e> <s> as i have tabled another amendment relating to this matter a little later on i am happy to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the parents have the strongest right here <e> <s> i am not at all impressed by what the minister has said <e> <s> the tribunal people may not turn up often but it seems to me that it will be extremely bad for those parents who happen to be there when they do <e> <s> i feel strongly about this <e> <s> the noble earl lord swinton and i have actually sat on these appeal committees so i hope that noble lords might pay attention to what we have said <e> <s> i intend to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble baroness said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an amendment to the government amendment but i presume i move that after the minister has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister anything to say to me about my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree entirely <e> <s> i am not altogether happy with the answer but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is very much the same as last time <e> <s> i am still not at all happy about the publication of exam results without the lea taking the initiative about this <e> <s> but i see that i am going to get no other answer and i do not think it would be profitable to pursue this to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords with that assurance i am prepared to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely amazed by one comment which the minister made <e> <s> she said that parents can find it should they wish to find it <e> <s> i thought that the great point about all this was that information would be freely available <e> <s> i really disapprove of that <e> <s> we want to have the information where parents can easily find it <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble baroness that capitation is probably something decided by the local education authority and that will probably be the same for all schools within the authority <e> <s> but all other recurring financial allocations and staffing quotas may differ and i think that these are very important <e> <s> therefore i am not at all satisfied with the ministers answer <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord that is exactly what i said <e> <s> i acknowledge that capitation allowances are spread over the whole range <e>", "<cs> my lords part of the reason for this amendment was to try to find out a little more about the position of the local authority as regards the assisted places scheme <e> <s> so far as i can make out the circular that went to independent schools on th december was sent to the local authorities with a short letter accompanying it explaining the intentions of the assisted places scheme <e> <s> the only real reference to local education authorities in the documents comes in paragraph which stated <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer was not of course entirely unexpected but i do feel very strongly about the position of the - to -year-olds at this moment <e> <s> i should therefore like to press my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that everything that the minister has just said is a very good argument for having some sort of national scale <e> <s> he has outlined the difficulties which the local authorities will face <e> <s> they are not suited to doing calculations of this type <e> <s> as regards these matters it seems to me most important that there should be a national charge and a national scale for remitting charges <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand the minister to say that the government are not willing even to give guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords with that assurance i will withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in the least convinced by the ministers argument <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness lady seear made some excellent points <e> <s> i also agree with the noble baroness lady masham of ilton that the bill has been rushed through <e> <s> we could have waited a little and i should have thought had a much better bill <e> <s> however at this time of night i shall not press the amendments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make just a few comments about this bill which i think has been a rushed bill <e> <s> it has been rushed in two ways it has been hurried through to get it on the statute book by the beginning of april and as a result a number of important matters which need to be legislated for have been left out of the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham mentioned warnock last week when we were at report stage <e> <s> the anxiety that many noble lords on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i say that i was of course aware of that situation which is only to be expected because i too have read the governments expenditure plans document <e> <s> but is the noble lord aware that all but three local authorities are cutting discretionary awards <e> <s> is he aware that this very morning giving evidence to the select committee on education science and the arts dr richard hoggart said discretionary awards are being wiped out <e> <s> what action are the government going to take in the light of these actions apparently paying no attention to the money that was put into rate support grant for the purpose of discretionary awards <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware if not i should like him to be that i would not base any question on newspaper reports without checking the facts <e> <s> in the light of what he has said will he give me an assurance that there will not be drastic cuts in discretionary awards <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply i should like to ask whether it is true that since i tabled this question with those three colleges named wreahead in north yorkshire and woodlands park administered by haringey are also to close and pyke house battle in east sussex urchfont manor in wiltshire burton manor in cheshire and wansfell hall in essex are also threatened with closure <e> <s> would the minister not agree that these colleges really are a national asset as they <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the short-term colleges the courses are at least a month in some cases <e> <s> would she agree that there is an obligation under section of the act where it says it shall be the duty to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what consultations are proposed with parents and the governors of the schools which will be affected in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that it is not only the education costs in inner london that are higher than those in the areas of many <e>", "<cs> my lords i have here a report which says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her answer <e> <s> may i ask her whether or not it will be true that children going to denominational schools will have to pay if they are new pupils of those schools <e> <s> present pupils i understand will be paid for but will it not be true that new pupils will have to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what is the attitude of the government about free transport to denominational schools <e> <s> in the past the government have always honoured the religious settlement made at the time of the act <e> <s> may i ask what this governments attitude is going to be in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she realises that the secretary of state said at the time of the second reading of the education no <e> <s> bill that he hoped that local education authorities would continue to provide transport to denominational schools <e> <s> is that still the attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that language students do bring in a great deal of foreign currency to this country <e> <s> we would not wish to have them restricted in any way <e> <s> is the minister aware that if the numbers were restricted a number of teachers might be out of work and the teaching profession has the largest number of people unemployed at the moment according to the ministers list of professional people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether a closing date has been fixed for representations to be received and is any timetable planned for the whole operation <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the minister that as only written representations will be received there will be no public meetings at which teachers parents and students and we must remember that the ilea area provides for a quarter of a million adult students will be able to say what they wish to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one final question <e> <s> when the review is completed i take it that it will then be circulated for comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the very full account he has given of the order and for answering the points which were raised by the joint committee about the disciplinary provisions <e> <s> i have no comments to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether the fees are collected for the whole year in one sweep <e> <s> surely they are paid termly in which case it would be perfectly easy to make a different arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the government take a fresh look at this whole subject in the light of the third report from the foreign affairs select committee which has just reported and which is highly critical of the present policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for her explanation of this extraordinary affair and also for her kindness in letting me know where i could read up the references and so on <e> <s> i was interested to read the account of the committee stage of the labour bill in on clause which said exactly the same thing as this order and to find that dr rhodes boyson suggested that the shelters might have been used as sanctuaries for bad boys or as chapels <e> <s> so it has caused me some interest and entertainment <e> <s> as local authorities have been fully consulted and are in agreement as they were with the labour bill i am very happy to agree to the order and to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply i cannot say that it is altogether satisfactory or informative <e> <s> what they are anxious to know is when the decision will be made <e> <s> they have waited for a long time <e> <s> in early they agreed to go to clegg for a feasibility study <e> <s> in the autumn they were told that it would have to be a full study in april of this year they were told that a full study would not be possible without a feasibility study first so they were back where they were a year ago <e> <s> is the minister aware that agreement has been reached and is within the cash limits so it would not seem difficult to ask to have a reply by a certain date <e> <s> can the minister possibly give that <e>", "<cs> certainly i am not going to go into the financial aspects at this time <e> <s> we were aware that there might be criticisms about the amendment but the secretary of state has taken so many powers to himself in this bill that i think just to be able to define housing stress area will not exercise him too far <e> <s> we are not at all convinced by what the minister has said <e> <s> i am grateful for the support we have had from around the committee and we shall press this amendment <e>", "<cs> do i understand from what the minister has said that one of the reasons the government are against this amendment is the fear that labour authorities will try to exploit any discretion to undermine the effective operation of the right to buy <e> <s> perhaps i could have an answer to that <e>", "<cs> we have cleared that up <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment would not prevent the right to buy because it gives only a limited discretion to the local authority <e> <s> the right to a mortgage would still remain <e> <s> can the minister tell me when these regulations will be published <e> <s> are we going to get them before report stage <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the minister has said <e> <s> i am not altogether happy about his reply <e> <s> i should very much like to see the regulations too <e> <s> i shall at the moment withdraw the amendment and shall possibly come back with it or one similar at report stage <e>", "<cs> having listened to what has been said including what the minister said i am quite willing to withdraw this amendment on the understanding that we shall have some further information <e> <s> if not we may come back on report <e>", "<cs> i think that in fact i knew quite a lot of what the noble lord the minister has been kind enough to tell us <e> <s> i cannot say that i have all that faith in a voluntary scheme <e> <s> i think that if we wait to see whether it will work it will he too late to get some statutory underpinning <e>", "<cs> again i am not very happy with the reply i have received from the minister <e> <s> i am sorry they have not taken a more advanced and imaginative approach to this <e> <s> i think voluntary co-operation is fine if you can get it but there are always bound to he some councils who do not co-operate and that spoils the whole scheme <e> <s> certain parts of the amendment have been criticised more than others so i should like to withdraw it for the time being and probably bring back the amendment in a slightly different form perhaps with some cuts and hope that it might be better received on report <e> <s> so i would ask leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation which of course we shall study with care but for the moment i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i should like to study what the minister has said and find out whether the answer is entirely satisfactory <e> <s> but for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> if the landlord has the chance of charging a two months deposit i do not think that he is very likely to charge less <e> <s> this amendment is reasonable and in relation to the potential liability is not going to make much difference <e> <s> some tenants will be able to afford to pay the deposit but a great many will find it very difficult to do so at the point of moving house <e> <s> therefore i shall press the amendment <e>", "<cs> in speaking against this clause standing part of the bill i want to say that there is no reason for giving quicker court hearings on possession orders on the basis of whether or not the case for possession is mandatory or discretionary <e> <s> that possession is mandatory does not mean that the outcome of the hearing is in any way certain <e> <s> possession only follows if the case is proved <e> <s> in many cases say for instance an alleged holiday letting as my noble friend said perhaps in hackney or brixton there may be very reasonable doubt as to whether the case will be proved <e> <s> neither is there any consistent relationship between the urgency of the landlords claim for possession and whether or not possession is mandatory or discretionary <e> <s> indeed it could be argued that the landlord facing substantial rent arrears or a tenant damaging his property might more urgently need possession than many of the landlords bringing mandatory cases for possession <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the minister has said <e> <s> i am not <e>", "<cs> may i add that there have been a great many government amendments since the bill was printed <e> <s> it is even more difficult to try to keep up with those <e> <s> they only come out a few days before the committee stage <e> <s> so that makes it even more difficult for us <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will know how we on this side feel and i think there has been some general support for the opposition to the option scheme as it stands <e> <s> we certainly do want to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that very often it takes a very long time to get to the matrimonial court <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will be quite sure that the educational and training element will be strong enough in these courses particularly if they are extended <e> <s> it may be difficult in things such as agriculture where one or two people may be working on one farm <e> <s> could i ask for a reassurance that the educational training element will be strong enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reinforce what the noble lord lord hylton has said and to ask the same questions about the kind of premises to which the clause would refer <e> <s> i should also like to know how they are going to be alerted to the need for action <e> <s> have <e>", "<cs> good <e> <s> just one example taken from a set of statistics for shows that in that year south shropshire which is an independent council expected to retain a working <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not persuaded by the arguments <e> <s> i think it depends on the importance one puts on the need for public housing <e> <s> homes are extremely important and i think this is the point <e> <s> we consider that homes in good repair are important and that is the reason we have moved this amendment <e> <s> but i will not press it at this time of night <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister asked us earlier to speak rather slowly so that we might hear <e> <s> in fact i found that he went extremely fast so if i ask foolish questions i must ask him to forgive me <e> <s> may i ask whether the effect of this amendment is to introduce retroactive legislation which will make any disposals by local authorities or housing associations which have occurred after th july null and void unless they received the consent of the secretary of state <e> <s> also will the minister confirm that if this amendment is accepted transactions which are legal today would <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me there really must be an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness the minister for that reply may i ask whether she is aware that the east midlands advisory council has decided it will not administer the funds allocated to it <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that the leas supporting the regional advisory council are giving far fewer funds and literacy adult projects and adult education altogether are suffering very much in that region <e>", "<cs> my lords coming back to an earlier answer by the minister do i understand that the department is going to sit back quite happily having allocated half a million pounds to this project and will do nothing about these regions <e> <s> you will put no pressure on them at all to have the projects carried forward <e> <s> it seems to me it is not much use giving the money unless it is to be spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make an appeal to the government on this amendment <e> <s> in some ways the scottish bill is rather more advanced than the bill for england and wales which has been going through the house <e> <s> i refer particularly to doing away with residential requirements and allowing people of over to go on the housing list <e> <s> but i think the bill will be not at all as advanced as the england and wales bill if this amendment is not accepted <e> <s> this amendment preserves houses specially built or adapted for occupation by persons of pensionable age <e> <s> this is not asking for complete <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could ask the minister a question <e> <s> would he not say that the words substantially different in line of clause would equally give the lawyers a field day <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith could have read my amendment <e> <s> it does not ask that large families should be imposed on local authorities <e> <s> subsection states very clearly which categories of people will have admission to the housing list and that their admission shall not depend on the fact that the applicant is resident in the area <e> <s> it is definitely for certain categories for people who have got work there or who have been offered work <e> <s> it is also for certain categories like the elderly who need to be near relatives and for others who have social or medical reasons <e> <s> the minister poured scorn on the social or medical reasons <e> <s> but that phrase has been accepted by his government in another bill so it seems strange that he should be so critical of it <e> <s> as housing authorities are constantly having to make decisions about who on medical reasons is to have a council house it does not seem to me to be a very strange one <e>", "<cs> my lords we also should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i think it is very necessary to cover the people living in small hostels and i hope that the minister will be able to accept this <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question about ilea <e> <s> there have been consultations with other councils and so on which have been asked to produce information <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether there have been any consultations with ilea <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply but of course it is far from satisfactory <e> <s> can he please tell me if there will be proper consultations with ilea <e>", "<cs> i think this is a slight improvement and we would welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> we should like to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> having had this manuscript amendment only this afternoon i should like a little longer to think about it <e> <s> i should like to ask if it comes from all the associations or whether this is just from the acc <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandford gave his support to it <e> <s> i know he is not supposed to be speaking for the acc but i should like to know if they support this <e> <s> i thought from the amendment he has down next that he would not like short-term indicators like this more frequently than annually <e> <s> i should like to hear whether this comes from all the associations or only from the acc with modified support perhaps from the adc <e>", "<cs> we have a good deal of sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> it seems to make it a little less hard for the councils in the information that they have to give and it gives them a little more freedom <e> <s> again we do not like the making of regulations so strictly so we would support these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied with the lord advocates answer but he has said that negotiations are still going on and there will be another meeting at the end of this week <e> <s> he said something that seemed to me rather strange that it is bad to single out special groups to consult <e> <s> i am not sure that i got the phrase exactly right <e> <s> it seems to me that the unions representing the work force of local government are a very special group and they certainly should be consulted very specially <e>", "<cs> i have already said that the new clause is an improvement on the original one but there are still reservations <e> <s> i think everyone will agree that to provide more and more intelligible information to ratepayers about their local authoritys expenditure and services is admirable and to be desired <e> <s> what local authorities and those who work for them are anxious about is the purpose that the information demanded by the secretary of state will be put to <e> <s> the secretary of state himself said speaking to the society of local chief executives <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one comment on this new clause <e> <s> it seems to me odd as it is now nearly a year since the first local government bill was introduced in this house that the government have really had to do this rush job and produce all these new clauses amendments and so on at this stage <e> <s> it seems to me incompetent and really very difficult for the committee to have all these new things to look at at the last minute <e>", "<cs> if there is no response to that i have one or two comments to make on the clause <e> <s> in fact i have a tiny bit of praise for the government <e> <s> we are glad that they have paid attention to the representations made by the opposition during the committee stage in another place and that this clause has been included in the bill <e> <s> i think it will make a difference to a certain number of people <e> <s> it may encourage some people who would not embark on standing for local authorities to do so <e> <s> even so it still would probably be at a certain financial cost to themselves but it is an improvement on the bill as it originally stood <e> <s> i hope that people will be encouraged to go into local government because i am an enthusiast for local government having served in it for years or so <e> <s> of course this slightly depends on what happens later on in this bill because if the independence and powers of local authorities are going to be eaten away as they may be if certain changes are not made people may be less willing to come forward <e> <s> anyway i can give a welcome to this clause <e>", "<cs> we are pleased to welcome in this clause the abolition of the three-mile limit for the payment of subsistence to councillors <e> <s> i speak with particular passion about this because i lived within one and a half miles of the shire hall in cambridge when i was a member of cambridgeshire county council <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble lord lord evans has said <e> <s> i was going to give general support to the clause but was going to ask about the position of opposition leaders and spokesmen <e> <s> i am not quite clear and i do not think the clause is quite clear whether they are going to be able to get the special responsibility allowance <e> <s> we support the giving of this as the robinson committee suggested but we think that the slight changes from what robinson suggested are on the right lines <e> <s> we are anxious to hear about the position of the opposition spokesmen <e>", "<cs> it may keep down the cost of making some sort of new valuation but on the other hand the council is not getting the benefit of the rates which would come from the increased value <e> <s> it seems to me that it is in a way a two-edged argument <e> <s> i feel that if there is not going to be a revaluation for some time this should be looked at again <e> <s> if the minister would be willing to consider this then i would withdraw the amendment for the moment and think about bringing it forward again on report <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have said unsatisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> we are not happy with the ministers answer nor with the situation but as he has criticised the wording of the amendment we shall now withdraw it and consider putting down something slightly different in wording but in the same sense as this amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> we do feel very strongly about this issue and we are going to ask the committee to divide on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot resist saying that i admire the ministers talent for spilling out words words words and more words but failing totally to answer the question <e>", "<cs> i have just one or two questions which i should like to ask the minister because there are a few points which make me rather anxious when i read this new schedule <e> <s> sub-paragraph states <e>", "<cs> i should like to tell the minister that in fact the amendment says per cent not just plus <e> <s> however i shall read what he has said in <e>", "<cs> may i make a comment on the clause <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord renton that there are certain obscurities about it but whether it is a gesture to the disabled or to the local authorities one welcomes it <e> <s> but i cannot resist saying that if this is meant to give some help to the disabled then nevertheless the other cuts in local government expenditure are making things worse for the disabled <e> <s> the district councils with housing cuts cannot give money for improvement grants to houses in the way they did nor money for adaptations to make houses easier for the disabled to live in with such aids as ramps <e> <s> there will be less money for new builds when special houses could be built and the power to lend to disabled owner-occupiers is reduced when they might want to do something to improve their houses <e> <s> where the counties are concerned the cash limits on the counties particularly on social services committees mean that what they can do for the disabled is very much less too <e> <s> they may be getting something here but they will lose it elsewhere <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a simple question and a particular one which is not really on the general principle <e> <s> in the consultation paper with which we have been provided under the heading exemptions is says <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble lord has said and although i cannot say that i feel at all happy about this general consent it just seems to me that the secretary of state is saying i want some money and i really do not mind how you get it go ahead i think i will not press this to a division <e> <s> we have had earlier successes and i will not press the luck <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i intervene at this point <e> <s> when dealing with that particular amendment i asked in what circumstances the minister could justify the words <e>", "<cs> would the minister be willing to take this amendment back <e> <s> there seems to be a certain amount of anxiety on this point <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am altogether satisfied <e> <s> one thing satisfied me in the noble lords reply the release of assets might be regulated <e> <s> that is something on the credit side <e> <s> i am still surprised that the secretary of state cannot trust these responsible boards and leave the judgment of the moment of sale to them <e> <s> i will withdraw the amendment for the time being but i reserve the right to come back on report <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for a moment <e> <s> if the minister is going to make the designation it seems to me that if generally they do not have an overall plan with quotas and so on it is very difficult to make a sensible decision on designation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i was particularly glad to hear that the moratorium is off for the moment <e> <s> i should be interested to hear more details about that <e> <s> i am very grateful for what we have got and to hear that the amendments have been accepted <e> <s> tomorrow i shall read the debate in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord avebury on this amendment i prefer amendment no <e> <s> which would delete the words a hawker or other itinerant trader or a gipsy and replace them with the words a person because that seems in line with paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords as a keen cyclist i should like to support strongly amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think we really ought to encourage cycling <e> <s> it is healthy and it is clean <e> <s> it is frightfully difficult in a great many places to find somewhere to park a bicycle when

authorities to cut their expenditure <e> <s> could one of the reasons for the change of method of giving a grant be that the des wish to cut down the number of staff who used to deal with that

be spent for this purpose <e> <s> because the same thing happened about the in-service training <e> <s> how are the government to monitor that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask this question <e> <s> does the new amendment really put the onus on the vendor of the plant to show that the plant was not taken from the wild <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved an amendment at an earlier stage of the bill trying to strengthen the enforcement clauses because we did not think they went far enough <e> <s> this amendment has gone some way <e> <s> it shows that the government have ack-knowledged the need for enforcement and this is to be given by the advice and assistance of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> we wanted them to have officers who could enforce it because they are the people who have the actual knowledge <e> <s> we have gone some way but i do not think that this amendment gives them the means to enforce the act <e> <s> i hope that in the other place there will be further amendments which will definitely strengthen this clause <e> <s> we still think that it does not go far enough as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that the government have carried out their obligations and the assurances which they gave at the report stage <e> <s> when the clause dealing with limestone pavements was dealt with in committee one point which was made was that the countryside commission should have a say <e> <s> but the second and most important point was that the landscape value of the pavements should be recognised in the clause <e> <s> this was stressed over and over again <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i just answer that <e> <s> the word physiographical has been in the clause right from the beginning and i understand that it means the scientific study of land form and does not actually refer to the landscape <e> <s> the ncc were there to consider the scientific features of the pavements and we hoped that the countryside commission would be there to look after the landscape side <e> <s> the countryside commission is in but the landscape is not particularly mentioned <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is quite acceptable <e> <s> i thank the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we are absolutely delighted to hear what the noble lord lord stanley said and that really habitats as well as wildlife are at long last being recognised as important <e> <s> we are delighted to hear the responsible attitude that he is going to take <e> <s> we just hope that all the farmers do so <e> <s> at this late stage of the bill it would cause great confusion if the title were changed <e> <s> such a lot has been going on over the months and months during which we seem to have been dealing with it <e> <s> i think that we will be against the change <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that probably the best way to improve the quality of teaching if it is not entirely satisfactory is to send teachers for in-service training <e> <s> is it not important to have enough money in the grant to enable in-service training to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply does she not think that perhaps four months is still quite a long time because there is great uncertainty for the staff for parents and for children in these cases <e> <s> the consultation will probably have been going on for six months or more before the proposal is sent to the department <e> <s> could the minister try to hurry up the whole affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one further question <e> <s> can the minister give an assurance that once the statutory two months for objections is finished the objections and queries which come in after that time will not be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the many closures for which the department has asked in the next year or so will the backlog get bigger <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the department intend to suggest about the per cent <e> <s> of pupils who take no exams neither gce o-levels nor cse <e> <s> what sort of assessment will they suggest for those pupils who need one just as much as the exam-takers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the des be making some pronouncement about the linking of the various examination boards <e> <s> they seem to be taking a long time about it and do not appear to be getting on very well together at the moment <e> <s> could the minister say further when the cockroft report will be issued and whether its proposals will be co-ordinated into any new proposals that will be coming out <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to ask his right honourable friends and perhaps his right honourable friend in the department of education and science whether they could do something about the fact that o-level candidates who leave at easter can go back to school and take their exams in the summer whereas those taking cse examinations cannot <e> <s> this seems to be grossly unfair and something which ought to be corrected quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is said even now that the examinations will not merge until but it seems to me that there is a long time between now and then <e> <s> could the noble lord get his right honourable friend to get things moving faster <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> may i ask what consultations there have been with the professional associations with the voluntary organisations and with the advisory council for adult and continuing education <e> <s> they seem to feel that there has not been adequate consultation <e> <s> if there has not will there be in the future before the report is available <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there will be consultation before the report comes out <e> <s> it seems to me that that is important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one last supplementary question <e> <s> will the adult side be consulted as much as the youth side <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to welcome this order very much <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is really up to the heads of schools to notice what is going on <e> <s> there is of course a difference between this and proper political education which i hope young people would receive as they are often at school until they are of an age to vote <e> <s> i believe that a number of heads in some london schools are taking responsible action and in that connection may i ask her to agree that it is up to the heads to keep an eye on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say if his department is really promising some further definite voluntary years training whether some form of voluntary service could be a part of that training <e> <s> that would be very useful for young people and the community as well <e> <s> may i ask this specific question why has his department not responded to requests for funding for community service volunteers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that we too are very much looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e> <s> we all know of the great experience that she has in this field <e> <s> we are of course grateful to the minister for her very clear exposition of the bill and for news of certain welcome developments in a number of areas which indeed the fact of the bill coming into being may have encouraged <e> <s> we are grateful too that the government have brought forward a bill based on some of the recommendations of the warnock report and that that report has not been put on the shelf beside various other reports of royal commissions lord rothschilds on gambling professor williams on obscenity and lord mcgregors on the press <e> <s> we are glad that it has not suffered that fate or the fate of about reports commissioned by the des which according to an answer to my honourable friend mr frank field in another place have not even been debated in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank my noble friend lord crowther-hunt for introducing the debate in so lively and interesting a way <e> <s> i found myself disagreeing with him on a certain number of matters and the word philistine came to my mind too in regard to deciding which subjects students should choose <e> <s> there should be freedom of choice provided that there is enthusiasm for the subject and the qualifications are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask whether the questions which have not been answered and i fully understand that they cannot be answered tonight will be answered in a letter <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could ask the noble baroness a question on this <e> <s> supposing this amendment were accepted what in fact does she imagine would happen to the child <e> <s> would the child be sent to a residential special school or a foster home <e> <s> i do not quite see what would follow from acceptance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to fall out with my noble friend lady gaitskell <e> <s> i hoped that i had made it clear that this was intended purely as a probing amendment and that i shall be withdrawing it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for what she has said and i shall read it again with interest <e> <s> however as i said i am withdrawing this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> as my name is to this amendment too i should like to say a word <e> <s> i was not entirely convinced by what the minister said in so far as it covered just physical access <e> <s> however as far as i am concerned i should be prepared to withdraw the amendment if lady darcy also is but i should like to reserve the right to come back on this matter at report having read and studied what the minister has said <e> <s> it of course depends on the noble baroness lady darcy <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly it seems the very minimum that we can do in this bill to make it a little better <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord lord digby that if he is really going to jib at making one ordinary school in an area fit for some handicapped children that is a very mean attitude indeed of the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i want to speak in favour of the amendment which i think was extremely ably moved by my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> i do not think there is nearly enough in the bill about teachers which was one of the main warnock priorities and if i may say so to the noble lord lord somers i think he is very optimistic if he thinks that subsection means that there will be enough properly qualified teachers for the various numbers and variety of children who will be in the schools needing this extra help <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord banks because it seems to me that it gets rid of the three discriminatory limitations contained in subsection which i find not at all satisfactory <e> <s> the amendment makes the whole bill very much more positive which i think is a good thing <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it has been said to me on a number of occasions when i have been discussing this bill with people actively involved in special education that the act deliberately discriminated in favour of children with special educational needs <e> <s> if we are not careful this bill is going to do exactly the opposite <e> <s> this amendment is one chance for us to redress the balance a little so i hope that we shall have support for it <e>", "<cs> it might be wise for the noble baroness to withdraw it we can if necessary return to the subject at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister says that it is an extremely difficult area to put into words so to speak but i would ask her whether if i withdraw the amendment we could have a guarantee that consultations and discussions will take place with local authority associations so they may all have a general view of what is expected and what is meant by these phrases <e>", "<cs> with that partial assurance that there will be consultations and a circular which will at any rate outline some of the factors that are to be taken into account i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is not a very satisfactory reply <e> <s> it seems to me that when it suits them the government constantly place duties on local authorities yet do not do so at other times <e> <s> in some instances the local authority is given some freedom but on other occasions the situation is very much reversed <e> <s> i should like to think about this matter since i might return with the amendment or something very similar at report stage <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> i think everyone wants to see a bit of flesh on the bones of this bill <e> <s> people will begin to believe that the government are serious in their intentions if the government ask local authorities to submit to the secretary of state some sort of development plan <e> <s> i believe that some authorities are already making these plans but we must encourage all authorities and not just the best ones to do this <e> <s> this would not involve local authorities in more than a minimum amount of expense but it would be something for them to aim at and would help them when they were applying for capital grants and so on to show that it was to fit in with a plan to make this bill a better bill and to make the act work <e> <s> f hope very much that the noble lord lord banks will press this amendment <e> <s> i think it is an extremely important point <e>", "<cs> may i reply to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> the point i was wondering about was how the governors were going to carry out that duty if they did not have the resources <e> <s> what i shall do is to consult with the people who asked me to table this amendment and find out whether they wish any further action to be <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that if somebody is to pass on this information it is much better done by somebody who has some experience and who knows something about the subject <e> <s> maybe we could hope that as there are supposed to be one in five children who will have special educational needs there might be one in whatever the number may be or governors who also will have some information about this <e> <s> so i do not think that it is a very satisfactory answer but i equally do not think that i should do very well if i pressed this amendment at this stage with so few people in the committee <e> <s> therefore for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for giving that very full reply <e> <s> i should like to study it carefully and will not make up my mind at this moment whether finally to withdraw it because that may not be the right thing to do <e> <s> i shall look at what she has said and decide whether or not to return to the matter on report <e> <s> but just for now i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble lord lord beaumont has said <e> <s> we are grateful of course that the minister is trying to meet us in some way but without seeing the amendment the situation is very difficult indeed <e> <s> this assessment will be made by a multi- professional team <e> <s> presumably the wretched parent will not be faced by the whole team i think that would be very alarming but if faced by one of them which will it be <e> <s> do we assume that the whole team has agreed on what is going to be done <e> <s> i think there are a lot of difficult questions about this <e> <s> even fairly sophisticated people as most of us i would say probably are always forget to ask half the questions that we want to ask when we go to see our doctors <e> <s> i certainly do although i do not have to go very often i am glad to say <e> <s> but one does suffer when meeting these sort of people in trying to remember all the things one intended to ask <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness seems to assume that the authorities will have to have some criteria to go on and that their decisions will depend upon a number of factors <e> <s> she mentioned the geography the distribution of populution and so on <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be possible to prescribe these by regulations <e>", "<cs> i see that possibly the decision not to assess might be because of the representations that the parent had made <e> <s> so far as clause is concerned there is not the absolute right to assessment unless we carry one of our future amendments so i think i shall leave this for now and see what happens <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on the question that clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady young for this explanation <e> <s> i shall of course look at what has been said <e>", "<cs> there has clearly been a great deal of anxiety on the part of a vast number of people about this -day period <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would consider a compromise of days if she could not accept <e> <s> if you are going to wait to go to appeal that is going to take a great deal longer than an extra couple of weeks <e> <s> i hope that she would pay attention to the anxiety that has been expressed by i think all the different societies and by a great many people in this house both at second reading and in committee today <e>", "<cs> i am all smiles at that reply <e> <s> that is the first bit of give we have had today so i thank the minister very much indeed and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if by that the government chief whip thinks i have not been fast he is very much mistaken <e> <s> i have spoken as briefly as i possibly could and i do not think i have used two words when one would do <e> <s> i have done my very best to make progress with the bill so it was unfair of the noble lord to make such a remark <e>", "<cs> as i was saying i am sorry that we have reached this major part of the bill at this hour because it is a matter about which people feel very strongly and needs a major debate so i shall not hurry over this aspect <e> <s> i shall be speaking to a number of amendments at the same time including manuscript amendment no <e> <s> a to which the chairman may wish to make reference <e>", "<cs> in speaking to no <e> <s> i shall with permission speak at the same time to the following manuscript amendments no <e> <s> a and and i shall make reference to amendment no <e> <s> to schedule <e> <s> these all relate to the subject of appeals <e> <s> taken together they would make a decision of the appeals committee binding on the lea in line with section of the education act but would at the same time retain the right of parents of children with special educational needs to appeal to the secretary of state <e> <s> it would mean a little bit of positive discrimination for those children with special educational needs and it is a bit of positive discrimination which i should like to get into the bill <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not convinced by the ministers reply <e> <s> let us have a look at the composition of the appeal committee <e> <s> under the act it can be made up of seven five or three people <e> <s> i hope it would never have more than five because that would seem to me quite enough for parents to have to face when there are also bound to be one or two officers in the room <e> <s> but suppose you make up your appeal committee of seven people <e> <s> you can certainly then have a choice according to the cases they are going to have to deal with <e> <s> you could afford to have one or two people with real expertise in this matter i should have thought and therefore they could be capable of coming to a decision with that decision being as binding as in the case of children with no statement <e> <s> the minister says they have this right of going to the secretary of state but i wonder in how many cases the secretary of state changes a decision <e> <s> the secretary of state is bound to go to the local authority for the information that it works on <e> <s> it sounds all right but i wonder how much of a bonus it is at the end of the day <e> <s> i do not think there will be any point in dividing the committee at this hour of night when a great many people have gone home but i am not satisfied about this <e> <s> i shall read every word that has been written and i shall come back probably with similar if not the same amendments at report stage <e> <s> for the moment i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that yet again the balance is being put against the parent <e> <s> this has happened all through the bill and in amendment after amendment we have tried to get the balance slightly the other way <e> <s> i should have thought that in this case it was reasonable to ask for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply and understand that the decision is not yet final <e> <s> but it is not the governments aim to strengthen responsible trade unionism and orderly collective bargaining <e> <s> is it not wise to avoid the fragmentation of unions which pervades the school sector and which makes collective bargaining there so difficult <e> <s> in such a delicate area as industrial relations is not a change foolish when something is working well as i understand the burnham further education committee is and might this not be changed if this extra place were granted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what representations the secretary of state has had from the local authority associations and from the teachers associations concerning the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for the minister to write that as well when he answers my previous question <e>", "<cs> i think the minister has argued against the amendment very much in the terms i expected partly by saying that there are enough safeguards in the bill in subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask one further question before the minister replies <e> <s> in what form is this information to be given <e> <s> is it going to be in a brochure for each school <e> <s> who is to pay for that is it to be the school or the authority <e> <s> it might come to quite a considerable sum <e> <s> i should be glad to have answers to those questions <e>", "<cs> was the word statement considered and turned down and if so why <e>", "<cs> i took because it was the figure which the government accepted in the other bill <e> <s> i shall be very glad having had the assurance that the minister will look at this to withdraw the amendment at this moment <e>", "<cs> the minister mentioned the new section a <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl the minister replies i should like to ask a further question about attitudes towards how much information parents will have information leading to decisions that will appear in the record of needs <e> <s> will the parents be given access to the professional reports and to the other evidence on which the assessment was made <e> <s> i do not believe there is anything in the bill about whether they will or not and it will be interesting to know the governments attitude to this <e>", "<cs> that is certainly the position in england as the bill stands but i should like to emphasise that all the organisations which deal with the different sorts of handicap are very exercised about this and are absolutely as one in wishing the situation to be changed <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i do not know whether he realises what my amendment no <e> <s> a says which would go into clause <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the support from the noble lord lord renton and for the qualified support from the noble viscount lord ridley and for the care which the minister has taken in responding <e> <s> i am quite prepared to believe that there are some drafting errors although almost the whole of amendment no <e> <s> and certainly the whole of amendment no <e> <s> are taken from the present education scotland bill <e> <s> i am aware that local authorities have to pay attention to the demand from to year-olds but this does not mean that they always provide what is wanted <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised by the reply from the minister although i am disappointed <e> <s> having myself seen what a tremendous difference the educational element can make in an adult training centre i feel that is vitally important <e> <s> however as i have not had much support from the committee i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i do not guarantee though having thought again not to bring it back on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government amendment refers to a particular voluntary organisation <e> <s> what is the reason for that <e> <s> supposing there is no branch <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister does not think that we are not grateful to her for having called the meeting the other day since we are extremely grateful <e> <s> it was very useful indeed <e> <s> she kindly handed us the amendment but i do not think that we really considered it in any detail nor indeed along with the other amendments that were down on the same subject <e> <s> so i am sorry that she will not withdraw it but if she insists on moving it now then at any rate we can endeavour to amend it at the report stage <e>", "<cs> having aired this which i think is a real problem and having had those assurances from the minister i will withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the arguments are what i expected <e> <s> i cannot say that i am very happy with the ministers answer <e> <s> i shall not withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for a reply which i must say i find extremely disappointing <e> <s> i think it is rather surprising that we had this commitment at second reading less than four weeks ago that the government give a firm undertaking that non-maintained special schools will be required to have governing bodies including parent/teacher representation and that they had not discovered already that it was going to be such a complicated matter <e> <s> i would point out that my amendment saysas far as is practicable <e> <s> i understand that it is suggested in line with clause that the regulations will do something about this <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether we shall see the regulations before report stage because obviously that would have a great effect on what our action would be at report stage <e> <s> i do think this is rather an important point and i should like an answer to it if i may <e>", "<cs> the regulations apparently will not appear before we have finished with the bill <e> <s> if we do not have the third reading until october will they be available by then <e>", "<cs> of course i shall read very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> although i am not very satisfied at present i shall for the moment beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it does <e> <s> i think that it is a satisfactory assurance but of course i should like to read it in <e>", "<cs> i added my name to this amendment which the noble lord lord vaizey tabled and he did not in fact let me know that he would not be here today <e> <s> although i have an absolute mass of material on this and could talk for at least minutes it might be more convenient for everybody if i did not move it now and left it to the noble lord lord vaizey to move on report when i hope that he will be here <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord alexander has moved the amendment of course i shall rise to support it <e> <s> i am surprised by lord rentons intervention because every voluntary organisation except the one that he is involved with is keen to have this body <e> <s> i really think that is true <e> <s> mrs warnock only two or three weeks ago speaking at a conference in oxford begged yet again that this should happen <e> <s> she described <e>", "<cs> i propose that this clause be left out <e> <s> the notes on clauses explain on clause that the provisions of section of the act give the secretary of state power to arrange for the medical examination of any child <e> <s> it is stated that the power has almost fallen into disuse but that nevertheless it remains necessary to enable the secretary of state to determine a range of other issues which might arise under the principal act it does not state what issues <e> <s> apparently however it will not do service for the purposes of this bill and therefore we have the provisions of paragraph of schedule which means that assessments of special educational need children are based on medical psychological and educational advice <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out that i do not want the children to go into care <e> <s> i meant that only as a final possibility in very difficult cases <e> <s> i am not altogether happy about what the minister has said i think that the balance should be the other way <e> <s> however at this stage on a friday afternoon i do not think it is worth pressing for the deletion of the clause <e>", "<cs> i still do not like it at all <e> <s> i think that probably it will be counter-productive and will not achieve the aim that is wanted <e> <s> however i shall read what the minister has said <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would say in answer to the noble viscount lord ridley that the secretary of state is referred to on a great number of occasions in this bill and i think one might equally say that is the business of the local authority <e> <s> i can only repeat that i am not satisfied but i will withdraw the amendment now <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have made it clear that my amendment was meant to be drawn so that the person with experience need not necessarily be a permanent member of the committee it could be a permanent member or it could be somebody co-opted for the special occasion as it were <e> <s> however if the minister would say there will be some guidance about this i should be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have sat on an appeal committee perhaps i may say that i have been rather horrified by some of the things which have been said today <e> <s> i do not think that appeal committees will be tribunals or courts of law <e> <s> they have got to be listening bodies <e> <s> it is most unlikely that a vote would ever be taken <e> <s> as the education authority a local authority is ultimately responsible for education in its area <e> <s> i believe that a local authority should have just a balance on the appeal committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister as her government are so keen on keeping up the quality and standards of education whether they will continue to reduce the number of hmis <e> <s> i understand that we have fewer in than we had in and it seems to me very important for the education service that hmis are kept up to strength <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that all countries which have overtaken britain in gross domestic product and in living standards per head overtook us first in the size of their higher education systems and is she happy that in the national interest it is wise to be reducing our higher education systems both public sector and university at the speed which is being proposed in these cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little discouraged by the ministers reply because i do not feel that we are perhaps going to have all the information that we should like as to how this act is working <e> <s> i take the point about the des annual report but i wonder how many of us have in fact held it in our hands <e> <s> i do not think it is unusual for reports to be laid before parliament <e> <s> the noble baroness lady phillips gave us examples and i think the disabled persons no <e> <s> bill has in it a clause clause which is very similar to the one that i have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister was a little hard on this amendment <e> <s> all it asks is that it shall be the duty of every lea to review and keep under review the arrangements made by them <e> <s> it is not trying to force the pace too fast <e> <s> the minister said that it did not look at the childs needs <e> <s> i thought it looked at the need of the child with a physical disability to be with other children of similar abilities and to be with many other children which we all agree is the right thing and is also good for the other children in the school <e> <s> i wonder whether she thinks that the third subsection is going beyond the scope of the bill and whether she would think of accepting subsections and if the third one was taken away and this amendment was brought back at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply do not understand how local authorities will get on without having some kind of plan on which to work <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull referred to the noble lord lord alexander as a director of education <e> <s> i have spoken within the last few days to a director of education in our area to ask him what he thought about this <e> <s> he is actually in post now <e> <s> he said that his area was making a plan which would be a -year plan and he did not see how they could possibly manage without it because they have to think about how they will use their buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one other point that has not been made in relation to this and that is the strength of feeling of the voluntary organisations and the associations <e> <s> we have to remember that those associations and organisations are made up very much of the parents of children who have these special educational needs <e> <s> we should bear that in mind when considering how we vote on this amendment which i should like to support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am fairly satisfied with the ministers reply and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has i think paid more attention to subsections and of the amendment and to the objections that she has to those and i can see some grounds for her anxieties there <e> <s> but i wonder whether as to the general principle enunciated in subsections and and indeed because in her amendment also the parent can meet one of the professionals to discuss the contents of any report she feels that her objections to the amendment that was moved in committee by the noble baroness lady darcy have been met in subsections and because it seems to me that we have gone a long way to meet the anxieties that were expressed about one or two possible items being kept back and which were of course mentioned in the warnock report <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could perhaps enlarge a little on that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one further question about the length of time involved <e> <s> the minister herself was anxious when we were trying to extend the notification period from days to days that a child might be out of school for some time <e> <s> if there are to be further meetings and further representations i wonder whether a professional will always be available at the time he is wanted <e> <s> has the department thought out what is going to happen to the child during what could be a very lengthy process <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord robbins has said everything that i was going to say but i should like to add one point about the difficulty of parents seeing reports <e> <s> an analogy with magistrates courts can be made where there is a social inquiry report and possibly a pyschiatric report as well the person concerned has to see the reports <e> <s> it is part of the duty for these to be seen <e> <s> if it can be faced up to there i think it could perfectly well be here <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that i am very grateful to the noble baroness that we have this firmly and clearly stated in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not convinced by the case <e> <s> if the lea have a really good case it should be capable of putting it over to the appeal committee <e> <s> then they would decide in favour of the lea of course <e> <s> i still feel that i should like to press this amendment to give the parents this little bit of positive discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers response was almost as i expected but even so i am still disappointed <e> <s> i should have thought that if we had passed a clause in this bill to do something for the to age group it could have been repealed as certain items in the act are being repealed in this bill <e> <s> with regard to the definition of young person i should have thought that could have been dealt with by repealing up to in the act <e> <s> in fact to seems to be a more appropriate definition of a young person than up to <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has mentioned my name i should like to say that i am pleased that he has looked at this again as he said he would and has at least improved it to a certain degree if not quite so far as we should have wished <e> <s> when i mentioned days before it was because that was the governments choice of time <e> <s> it was not an opposition amendment but what the government decided to put in <e> <s> at any rate i am very pleased about what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that answer may i ask whether he is aware that my question refers to this autumn so that the million for is really not relevant although of course we are pleased to have it <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that while he may not have evidence of -year-olds not getting places i have such evidence applying all over the country where technical colleges or colleges of further education have had to reject students <e> <s> i will name a few hampshire cumbria kent thanet technical college sheffield granville college of further education liverpool collquitt college clwyd and i have details of many more all over the country <e> <s> is the minister aware that these young people have applied for specific courses and that while the yop programmes may be very good these young people wish to do some particular thing and that therefore it seems a great waste that either they should have to wait for yop programmes or their particular abilities and desires cannot be met and they are left unemployed <e>", "<cs> if i may ask a final supplementary question my lords may i ask whether the minister would agree that senior pupils as defined in section of the act that is pupils from to have a right under sections <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us any sort of date when the governments responses to these representations will be made and when any new scheme will be announced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that at the end of five and a half hours of debate no one wants me to make a second speech and i shall not <e> <s> but i should like to thank everyone who has taken part <e> <s> we have had an interesting and lively debate <e> <s> i thank the noble viscount lord trenchard for making such an effort to answer the questions of which i gave him notice

like to thank the noble lord lord young for initiating this debate tonight <e> <s> i wish i had thought of doing it myself because i think it is a matter of great importance <e> <s> i was delighted that he congratulated the rampton committee because it has not been recognised enough for the work that it has done <e> <s> i was glad to hear the noble lord lord swann say this <e> <s> it seems to me that in the time they had they did an extremely good job of work <e> <s> they did what they were asked to do <e> <s> they came out quickly with a report and with recommendations <e> <s> they are extremely good recommendations and i hope that they will be followed <e> <s> as we have had the good fortune to have the new chairman of the committee the noble lord lord swann taking part in the debate i should like to wish him and his committee well in the very difficult and sensitive task that they have to do <e> <s> he has mentioned a number of matters into which they will be looking <e>

scrutinise it with scientific thoroughness <e> <s> so i wish them well <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the minister for his explanation of the new draft regulations <e> <s> as the noble lord will know have no enthusiasm for the subject of assisted places and these new regulations it seems to me will bolster up what i regard as a very unwise scheme and particularly unwise and unimaginative at a time when the state education provision is being damaged by extensive cuts on local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could interrupt the minister i should like to say that if the government had had confidence in the state system and put money into it there would be very good provision in the state system <e>", "<cs> my lords how do the government propose to supply enough training in the technical colleges for their new youth training scheme announced in december which i know does not start until this year <e> <s> if the technical colleges are to sustain the cuts which they undoubtedly are it would seem to me that they would be quite unable to take on the training which will be necessary <e> <s> will the government reconsider the cuts in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that women get a look in at the end <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he has looked at the document which outlines the nus plans for action

that the students have something to be worried about <e> <s> their grant will be increased by only per cent <e> <s> which is well below the rate of inflation the parental contribution is frozen at its present level and the minimum grant is frozen <e> <s> they have something to take action about <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that this will be political experience for the students and that political experience is something that students ought to learn and to go in for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his explanation of this short bill and to say at once that the opposition gives it support and indeed welcomes the billion and the change of heart on the part of the government <e> <s> i note with interest that the limits of the public sector borrowing requirement seem to have acquired a degree of flexibility <e> <s> i think we can be pleased that the government are learning <e> <s> when they came to office there was definite suspicion of new town

the government in setting up urban development corporations for docklands and merseyside are copying the new town pattern <e> <s> we know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery <e> <s> i would agree with the minister in what he has just said that there need be no conflict or competition between the new towns and the udcs and we wish them well <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene we are not against the sale of assets what we are against is selling them prematurely when their value might be greater later <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us an idea of the cost <e> <s> if the overseas students were exempted for the first year as well as the later years of their course what difference would that make <e> <s> following up what the noble lord lord donaldson said would such action be worth while for the promotion of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that advice has gone out to some regional dhss offices saying that for those unemployed persons studying under the -hour rule the hours must now include the lunch break and private study <e> <s> is that dhss policy and has the des been consulted about this <e> <s> why has this instruction gone out if the matter is still under review <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what is the policy in respect of day release trainees and apprentices who are made redundant or whose firms go bankrupt <e> <s> will they be allowed to continue their courses and to draw supplementary benefit or will the whole value of the training they have had be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if he will reply to an earlier question i asked him to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether attention will be paid to the recommendations particularly recommendations to of the select committee for education science and the arts which produced a report <e>", "<cs> my lords it was december <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the ministers reply <e> <s> i am prepared to accept that the drafting is not ideal and that the amendment may not have been applied to the most correct place in the bill <e> <s> i am not altogether convinced that it is a passing phase <e> <s> too much money is made from these machines for the people running them to let them go out of

prisoners and escort them to classes in the evening and will there be as many evening and adult classes as there were before <e>", "<cs> it does seem to me rather a pity that we have to put up with all these antics because we have these two bills going through at the same time <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister tell us when we may expect mr lloyds bill to arrive in this house and when the whole thing is likely to come to fruition <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to bring a perhaps discordant note from this side of the committee but i am rather worried about this <e> <s> having represented an area in cambridge where there are a great many take-away food shops and living very close to an area where there are still a great many food shops i think that it is necessary to have some control <e>

just a tiny bit suspicious about this <e> <s> so i shall wait to hear what the minister has to say <e> <s> but for the moment i am not at all sure that i shall be supporting the noble lord lord evans in his amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a lot of sympathy for this new clause proposed by the noble viscount particularly as he prefaced his remarks by saying how much he wants school premises and playing fields to be used by <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that there will be a drop of of advanced students by when we shall then have the lowest proportion of year-olds in higher education for years <e> <s> also would it be possible for him to tell us as the white paper does not break down the figures the numbers of university admissions and the number of admissions to the maintained sector <e> <s> as i say in the white paper they are given altogether and it would be interesting to know how they break down <e>", "<cs> it is obviously not our province to give advice but i think that the later stages of the bill give us a chance to find out exactly what the bill means <e> <s> i think that after second reading some questions were left unanswered and it is within our province now to try to find out exactly what the meaning of certain sections is <e> <s> i should like to direct my attention for the moment to sections and <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton and the noble and learned lord scarman gave what seemed to me to be excellent descriptions of those sections <e> <s> i want to know whether their opinion of what is in those sections is accepted by the government and

behind them and another for us without them <e>", "<cs> some authorities seem to be worried that when a notice is served on somebody asking them to carry out works and they do not do it there is no penalty that can be imposed in the bill for that <e> <s> will the noble lord comment on that so that we may think whether we might want to put down an amendment on report <e>", "<cs> if the person on whom the notice is served could do the work but simply refuses to do so should there not be a sanction against that <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that the minister has taken this line <e> <s> we need some more explanation for i was also going to ask who pays <e> <s> it seems a great burden <e> <s> i was delighted that the noble viscount spoke first <e> <s> it seems that quite a burden is being put

consider what i should do <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the training centre which the fenland district council is running with manpower services commission money has to count against the p rate given under the act <e> <s> would that sort of consideration be taken into account when the government are finally deciding what they should do as a result of consultations <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> if i could reply to the noble lord lord hawke the extent of the problem can be demonstrated by the

have put down again <e> <s> i did rather wonder about months myself but i suppose it is a regular period and that is really what matters <e> <s> i am very grateful for what the minister has said about this so far as the cost is concerned <e> <s> i wonder whether he is also able to make an offer to meet the health and safety executive to discuss the merits of the proposed amendment <e> <s> i understand there was a meeting with them about the ultra-violet tanning amendment which we put down earlier <e> <s> the meeting about that had a quite satisfactory outcome so i wonder whether he might consider a meeting on this aspect as well as considering the cost <e> <s> perhaps i may also say to the noble lord lord hawke that manchester had within its bill the amendment we have put down <e>", "<cs> i understand the minister to say that the amendment was not within the scope of the bill <e> <s> it was of course accepted here by the public bill office <e> <s> the amendment is to existing powers under section of the local government miscellaneous provisions act <e> <s> the legislation was itself drawn up with reference to local acts just as this legislation is notably in that case the

although additional points are included which are not in the greater london council act recovery of local authority administrative cost and action on voluntary disconnections the proposals are esentially based on local act powers <e> <s> in addition the bill seems an appropriate vehicle for amendng powers in an existing local government miscellaneous provisions act <e> <s> perhaps the minister would respond to that point and i leave my noble friend to respond to the rest of what he said <e>", "<cs> following what the noble lord lord mottistone said i should like to ask the minister whether he will consider withdrawing amendments nos <e> <s> a and b until the report stage because i feel that there has not been adequate consultation with the local authorities and they have not been given ample opportunity to respond <e> <s> i understand that when they were notified of this matter there were effectively only two days for them to consider it and that seems to me totally inadequate <e> <s> since clearly we are not going to have the report stage for another two or three weeks it would be reasonable for the local authorities to be given another opportunity to look at

very soon after its publication <e> <s> there was an urgent need for this review <e> <s> the introduction tells us how it was sparked off by a discussion in between peter brinson of the foundation and peter newsom of ilea a discussion on the public debate that had been opened on education and in particular because of references to the core curriculum and a recurrent emphasis on the three rs <e> <s> they were worried that these references seemed to exclude the arts <e>", "<cs> i agree my lords that our choirs and some of the cathedral choirs i appreciate of course that they are trained in special schools are of tremendous benefit to the nation and i know that the choirs of st johns school cambridge and kings choir school have travelled all over the world to sing <e> <s> i think that music has to have special attention i would grant that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to ask one question which i had intended to raise earlier <e> <s> this concerns the slides from the victoria and albert museum <e> <s> there was trouble and it was thought that the whole service was going to stop <e> <s> i am not quite sure what the latest news is <e> <s> after what the noble lord has said about museums it would be very interesting if we could hear what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree though that there is discrimination <e> <s>

similar arrangement for university teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and we too are grateful for mrs trenamans review of the schools council but we are surprised that despite the gratitude that the secretary of state expresses he has ignored her recommendation for a national body dealing with both curriculum and examinations <e> <s> the schools council is to be abolished <e> <s> instead of mrs trenamans recommendation for a streamlined council with the number of committees reduced and the numbers on those committees reduced with which we were in complete agreement there are to be two councils one on examinations and one on the curriculum <e> <s> the secretary of state will apparently have great powers of <e>", "<cs> my lords

read before because i was kindly supplied with it where it says specifically that on the curriculum council there will be teachers but it does not say that in relation to the examinations council

when a case has to go to appeal so that either the supplementary benefit or the hours of tuition are not lost for long <e>", "<cs> my lords as ilea is mentioned in the question will the minister agree that ilea behaved absolutely properly in following government guidelines in the sale of a redundant school and did everything that it should do and nothing that it should not do <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord molloy for introducing this debate and as the noble lord lord rochester said for the humanity with which he did so <e> <s> i am sure we all got the feeling that he himself has about the waste which goes with youth unemployment <e>", "<cs> well my lords i do not think i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i am not going into a definition of education in this short debate but i could perhaps have a discussion with him at some other time <e> <s> i do not think that learning specific skills and also having a wider learning about social skills and life generally are so incompatible as he thinks <e>", "<cs> if they were making use of outside computers <e> <s> if they were linked with them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that at per cent <e> <s> local authorities have proportionately the lowest percentage of empty dwellings of all the tenure sectors <e> <s> those figures came from the first report of the environment

noble lord says that he will look at it then i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to go back to the main purpose of these clauses <e> <s> i believe that the main purpose is to get at bedfordshire and to deal with the bedfordshire problem <e> <s> i do not think that we would have had all these clauses if it had not been that the government wished to right that situation <e> <s> they have shown an extraordinary lack of confidence in their own bill <e> <s> i read through the committee sittings in the commons the th and st which dealt with the bedfordshire situation <e> <s> the minister said with confidence on a number of occasions that the bill as drafted would deal with the situation <e> <s> clearly the government have decided that it does not do so

difficult position because as the noble viscount said i have an amendment on slightly different lines but aiming at the same good purpose and i thought that perhaps i had better wait and hear the

subsection and section a <e> <s> nevertheless by complying with the local authoritys instructions without giving the local authority notice of his intention to do so the contractor would be contravening the provisions of subsection and the local authority would be a party to that contravention <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for having taken note of the comments

procedure but it seems to me that appeals are rather different <e> <s> we are a bit anxious about these appeals going to the county court because things can take so long there <e> <s> there are considerable delays compared with the magistrates court in getting access to the county court for the registering and hearing of appeals and to halt works considered to be a danger to public health because an appeal has been lodged through the county court process would seem to take away much of the power associated with the provision and provide a recipe for delay and inaction <e>", "<cs> my

lords i hope the noble viscount will not be so willing <e> <s> i have never heard such a long answer really saying not very much and the fact that one or two national parks may get involved when there are nine district councils i think the noble viscount said in one case is absolutely ridiculous <e> <s> i think this is really making a tremendously big meal out of nothing very much <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble viscount lord ridley will pursue this <e> <s> i do not think that what the minister has said about pursuing it is very convincing and i hope that a strong line will be taken opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment has come about as a result of something that i raised at committee stage so i am grateful that the government have produced it <e> <s> i am not quite sure how long after reasonable inquiry is but maybe it is better not to inquire <e> <s> it could be either shorter or longer <e> <s> i just want to raise one point about placards <e> <s> i asked on th march in the debate on clause stand part whether anything that was put on a boards could be obliterated or removed and the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the royal commission had a concern four years ago it went much further than i have gone in the amendment yet nothing has been done <e> <s> we heard last time about constructive suggestions possibly coming forth it is all promises but the years pass and nothing is done <e> <s> the minister thought a fine of say was rather large if these people were convicted <e> <s> on the other hand earlier today we agreed a fine of for an under -year-old being inside not even being employed in a sex shop or sex establishment so i do not quite follow his logic in that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that per cent <e> <s> or children between the ages of five and years are left alone during the holidays and that per cent <e> <s> of - to -year olds are left alone after school <e> <s> the figures for an older group of - to -year olds are per cent <e> <s> during the holidays and per cent <e> <s> after school <e> <s> does he think it sensible that hundreds of millions of pounds should be spent on school education and really a pittance spent on facilities after school and during the holidays <e> <s> indeed the figures which he gave really do i think amount to a pittance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a slight protest to make about amendments being put down at a late stage <e> <s> in the marshalled list on monday the first day on report there was a new clause which we saw only that morning <e> <s> as there were many references in it to other acts and sections it was difficult to understand it and get advice at the last minute <e> <s> this morning when i collected the second marshalled list i found there had been changes again to the new clause we are discussing several lines had been removed from subsection <e> <s> it is difficult for somebody who is not a lawyer to understand what is happening <e> <s> we might have a little more consideration from the government about the timing of such amendments or at least we could be given notes on new clauses <e> <s> the government were generous enough to provide notes on clauses at the beginning of the proceedings but we have not had notes on new clauses and that is why i lodge this protest <e>", "<cs> i am now in the rather ridiculous position of moving an amendment to a clause which is about to be deleted <e> <s> this of course has come about because of the very recent new clause which was put down instead of clause and which was shown in the marshalled list to be inserted after clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for expanding a little on the letter which he wrote to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> may i make it quite clear that when i spoke first i said we considered that voluntary assistants would be seen as being within the provisions of section of the local government act which says that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for at any rate some satisfaction <e> <s> i shall have to accept that subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the two amendments that i moved last time but withdrew to deal with the problem of animals being left horses hens or whatever are being accepted here <e> <s> although the government have not accepted my wording which was or keep i am very happy with look after it adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for that clarification <e> <s> he queried whether i had the right to read from the noble viscounts letter to him but as it was sent under cover of a letter to me from lord ridley i felt i could use the information in it and as the noble viscount was not here himself i thought it was rather important to get the matter clarified today if we possibly could before the meeting which it is to take place i understand on monday when i hope very much that things can be sorted out with certainly the hope that something which is agreeable to all the associations might be put down for third reading <e> <s> so i thank the minister for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply and i am very relieved to hear that the national museums are performing this function <e> <s> would he not agree that it is the job of our national museums in particular the v and a with its collections to make exhibitions available to areas outside london especially the provinces and the areas far distant from london where people do not have the opportunity to come to see the collections here <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is very important that these exhibitions should go not only to museums and galleries but to public libraries and to teacher training colleges and art colleges so that the general public is exposed to them and is able to see them and in that way perhaps some new recruits to the arts may be obtained whereas if the exhibitions go only to museums and galleries then the same audiences will see them as see them generally <e> <s> so i would hope that if these exhibitions are started again they can go to libraries and colleges as well as to museums and galleries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> supposing a local authority has this fund already established as i understand is the case with a great number of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that careful and long reply <e> <s> clearly trouble has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally very gratified at this final success and i am grateful for the support of the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> i also should have preferred a higher fine but i assumed that home office support was necessary and they thought this was the appropriate fine so i felt i had better accept it <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord mottistone that we had to arrive at some compromise if we were going to get anything and that is why this amendment does not perhaps go quite so far as he might wish <e> <s> at any rate it is very nice to have a success and i am very grateful to everyone who has contributed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that i am again very grateful to the minister and glad that this has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my comment at report has made an improvement in the drafting of the bill and indeed in the english of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i must accept what the minister said as i cannot have extra legal advice given me at the moment <e> <s> it is clearly a matter where the lawyers disagree <e> <s> in view of the noble lords remarks i have no option at this stage but to beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that standard would not mean a fixed charge <e> <s> could it however refer to a scale of charges <e> <s> we do not want that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister assures me that the charge can be varied considerably and that there will not be an expected charge or scale of charges i hope i have the necessary reassurance and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask whether i now have it clear that if a person does not bother to reply the matter does not have to go to arbitration <e> <s> that seems to me the point that we really need to have cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately third reading does not give an opportunity to read a minis <e>", "<cs> well my lords the answer that the minister gave did not really deal with the last point i made about how people who are to operate the act will understand about the two sections from the act <e> <s> is the minister able to say that a circular or some advice will be issued after the bill becomes law in order to explain to those who have to operate it that there is the old act <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can answer that question before i finally decide what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much and in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply i must admit that i am not very clear about what is going to happen <e> <s> would the minister not agree that it is entirely inappropriate for part of the statutory education service to be subjected to investigations by officers of her majestys customs and excise as if adult education were not a statutory provision <e> <s> would he not agree that sections and of the education act impose a duty on local education authorities to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of these courses are extremely therapeutic <e> <s> why should we distinguish between flower arrangement and ballroom dancing which are the sort of courses which are thought to be entirely frivolous and other <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a final supplementary question <e> <s> is the minister aware that although it may have been possible to do this since i believe it is only very recently that there have been threats to do this <e> <s> essex humberside and haringey are three authorities where there have been such threats <e> <s> i do not think that it has been done prior to the last year or so <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support for this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull made an admirable case and the noble lord lord donaldson made further points <e> <s> the dhss research has shown that many care orders are made in criminal proceedings on young people convicted of petty property offences with few if any previous convictions <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of the care orders made in criminal proceedings were imposed on first offenders and per cent <e> <s> were imposed on first- or second-time offenders <e> <s> i do not think that this is a very satisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> if these criteria were used i think that it would help uniformity as the noble baroness said <e> <s> if it helps uniformity helps the courts and helps the social workers and parents it would be excellent if the government were to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i add one point to those which my noble friend has just made <e> <s> when the minister replied to the amendment he said that the seriousness of the offence should be the criterion <e> <s> i read out research which had been conducted by his own department which showed that the majority of care orders made in criminal proceedings are made on young people convicted of petty property offences with few if any previous convictions <e> <s> therefore the research carried out in the ministers own department shows that something needs to be done <e>", "<cs> whether i should read out the letter that introduces these figures i do not know but it comes from the dhss <e> <s> the letter is signed tony newton <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord the minister knows as little as i do about these figures <e> <s> i was going to say i was sorry that i did not have the figures for the survey which the dhss seemed unwilling to make available to us <e> <s> now they are available but at such a late moment that it has been impossible to digest them <e> <s> there is no doubt that there has been a growth in the use of secure accommodation for children in care under the law and regulations relating to its use and present practice by social service departments <e> <s> a detailed commentary on this together with detailed proposals for reform are made in the childrens legal centre report <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one point before anyone else speaks <e> <s> i hope that perhaps the noble baroness lady faithfull will make some comments on this matter <e> <s> the reviews which are supposed to take place a matter to which the noble baroness referred earlier do not always take place <e> <s> i should like to be told the answer to the following question <e> <s> the reviews are supposed to be undertaken regularly but do the reviews actually happen <e> <s> there may be regulations but are they observed <e>", "<cs> i shall not press the amendment tonight because clearly a great deal more work has to be done <e> <s> i am surprised that the government have not taken more steps to find out exactly where they stand in relation to the european convention between whatever it was march and june <e> <s> i must tell the minister i do not know whether he can communicate with me before report stage that we shall certainly want to put down more amendments before report if we do not have some sort of satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> well i will agree to let the noble lord lord avebury intervene <e>", "<cs> what i thought i said was that if we did not get some sort of satisfactory answer before report stage we should bring this forward again and take more positive action <e> <s> we are withdrawing at this moment only because we hope perhaps to have some correspondence and some satisfactory statement before the time to put amendments down for report stage of the bill <e> <s> that is my position which i should like to make clear <e> <s> on those terms i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it will not be moved <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept that hours is rather too short a time <e> <s> if one thinks of adults having to be brought before a court if they have been in custody overnight perhaps it can be justified in that way <e> <s> section of the children and young persons act requires young people detained to be brought before the court within hours <e> <s> that was probably another reason why hours was the period chosen a safeguard to ensure that such placement in secure accommodation could not last for more than hours <e> <s> the noble baroness would no doubt say that that is a different matter <e> <s> i accept that and as i say i accept that it is too short a time <e> <s> j agree it would be wise to withdraw the amendment now and hear what is to be done about the whole business of judicial review <e> <s> this is a very important matter indeed and if we do not receive satisfactory assurances before report no doubt the noble baroness and i would be prepared to table another amendment for that stage <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question before he sits down <e> <s> is it a case that every community home with education has a board of governors <e> <s> i am a governor of one such establishment and the noble baroness lady trumpington also was a governor of the same establishment <e> <s> i assumed that this was the case everywhere <e> <s> maybe it was just that we belonged to an enlightened authority which had governors of community homes with education <e> <s> on the board of governors were several members of the local community <e> <s> this was extremely important <e> <s> they could react and come in constantly <e> <s> i am sorry to be ignorant on this but i should like an answer <e>", "<cs> we had an all-night sitting on the education bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i expected that reply and it is of course not at all satisfactory <e> <s> it seems hard that one provider of part-time degree courses should be treated so generously and get half a million i am delighted that it has while the other <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask why the other part-time provider should be treated so badly <e> <s> is the minister aware that part-time students at birkbeck have to pay for their courses the fees have doubled in the past year and they have to pay for their fees out of taxed income <e> <s> there is very little help for them and in fact only per cent <e> <s> get any help at all from their employers or from other sources <e> <s> there are hardly any discretionary grants now <e> <s> is it not time the government took a more kindly attitude to these highly-motivated students <e>", "<cs> my lords could the government not realise that this is a particular situation and that the students from birkbeck come i entirely agree with what my noble friend has said about local authority colleges but the students of birkbeck come from a wide area <e> <s> they take the trains when they run from places as far as plymouth portsmouth and so on perhaps not plymouth but portsmouth <e> <s> they come from a wide area round london <e> <s> the oldest student is and the youngest student is <e> <s> could this very special thing that birkbeck provides not be considered as a separate matter by the government <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much <e> <s> i am absolutely delighted though not altogether surprised and of course will withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if there has been trouble about some particular sections of the act would it not be possible to implement certain sections <e> <s> is the noble earl aware how upset the botanical society of the british isles is about the news it is getting of plants being uprooted <e> <s> the noble lord lord craigton has just mentioned the lizard orchids but there is other evidence <e> <s> i know that some are protected already but the increased fines should be implemented as soon as possible <e> <s> can the noble earl do something to implement some parts of the act at once even if the whole lot cannot be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords surely there may be others who are not on those scholarship awards and who might be grateful to come if they did not have to pay the full fees for overseas students <e> <s> as the government have given through the noble lord lord belstead in his written answer to the noble earl lord kinnoull on th june a welcome to the report of the overseas students trust where preferential fees are suggested for certain countries would not namibia be a very good candidate for this <e> <s> how will the government answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said a great deal in his reply but i do not think any of it has convinced me that there is any good reason why a young person should be sent to an adult prison even for a very short time <e> <s> as the noble lord lord avebury said many of the objections are administrative ones which surely could be got over and the finger-printing and so on could be done at a police station <e> <s> anything is better than having a young person in prison even if it means going slightly further from home <e> <s> if the detention rgime is upset at the thought of having a youngster there for a time may i quote what the minister said at committee stage though admittedly in another context <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken very much during this report stage but i have been listening <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is not an inter-parliamentary but an all-party group and so we are grateful for what we have got <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i should have said that i was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and all together <e> <s> i had it at the top of my paper and forgot to read it out <e> <s> as we have that amount of give on the part of the government i think that we should now really consider what we should do the government having agreed that some action has got to be taken and that there would be a contravention of the european convention <e> <s> the letter says <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are very glad there has been an advance from the committee stage at the report stage and a good many things that we said then have been accepted by the government <e> <s> what we are not prepared to accept is that it is still impossible to do something in this bill <e> <s> i imagine that we are not going to have third reading until after the summer recess that means october and that gives several months <e> <s> i am doubtful about the need for all the consultations which have been mentioned <e> <s> there must have been consultations about this bill and if we are likely to be in breach we are in breach and action ought to be taken now <e> <s> this seems to be the ideal opportunity <e> <s> talk of what goes on in the regulations is nothing to do with that matter but they cannot cope with that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord the minister will question his department as we have questioned him because this seems to be a totally unreal situation <e> <s> as a member of a social services committee and as a magistrate i find the whole situation totally unreal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest and i think that i may have mentioned this in committee that when the independent people are being considered for governors people in the locality of the home should be borne in mind and not just magistrates <e> <s> it is a very good thing to have local people on the governing body because they can strengthen relations between the children in the home and the community and perhaps make the community more sympathetic to the purposes of the home and the children within it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that support from the noble lord lord auckland <e> <s> i never heard such a lot of flannel as came from the minister just words words words <e> <s> there are such things as calculators nowadays if one wants to work out how many days weeks or months are involved <e> <s> i should have thought this was a simple proposition <e> <s> of course i shall not press the amendment but i must ask the minister if he will look at the matter again because his answer was totally unsatisfactory and stupid <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read again the lengthy first speech of the minister and decide what to do at the next stage of the bill but for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that this was a suggestion which would save the courts a great deal of time and i think that the prisoners would benefit from it and come out with a clean slate <e> <s> there would still be the opportunity for the courts to impose fines and get the money if in fact they thought that the prisoners were being treated too generously <e> <s> i do not think that it would prevent that from happening <e> <s> however i shall of course read what the minister has said and if i am not convinced as i feel i am not convinced at the moment i can come back at the next stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to accept what the noble lord says although as i said i am aware of social workers who are involved with whole families and have a great deal of information which they can provide <e> <s> no doubt that information will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and am relieved about the easter leavers <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that that still leaves the young people who leave school at whitsun that is at the end of may and those who leave in july and that they will not be able to start pre-vocational courses in september which have been specially organised for unemployed young people <e> <s> is it not the case that if those regulations are not altered by the dhss they will have to wait doing an apprenticeship of unemployment rather than training for employment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the -hour rule says anyway that they have to be available for employment <e> <s> if the government are worried that those who leave school and then perhaps might do a full-time a-level course will be able to claim supplementary benefit could they not make some special regulation to exclude that one group of people and give the opportunity still to those many others who will be unemployed and out of training <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how he reconciles these figures with her majestys inspectorates report which says that many subjects have disappeared from the curricula in many schools that remedial teaching has disappeared and that certain subjects like craft technology and music are not provided in every school <e> <s> are the figures not partly the result of the fall in rolls <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i guess that perhaps he is not that the educational publishers council has produced a spending guide for local education authorities in which it points out that if the local authorities were to spend in real terms what they spent in on books and equipment the figure would be nearly million and not million which was the figure mentioned by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords and noble baronesses who have spoken <e> <s> like the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge i could not quite understand why the noble baroness lady faithfull could not accept both this amendment and the next amendment that the noble lord lord wigoder will shortly be moving <e> <s> i also did not quite understand the point made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton when she said that children might go out after an evening meal <e> <s> they might not even come in for the evening meal <e> <s> they might be out all the time and it might be difficult to get them in by six oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to this amendment <e> <s> the feelings of those of us on these benches about the night restriction order are i think known and this amendment would certainly mean an improvement to it <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble baroness lady faithfull has said and i hope that this will be accepted and that it will be tried in a number of really very different areas <e> <s> i hope the minister will also remember the resource implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i have misrepresented the minister <e> <s> i think the government admitted the possibility that there was a risk of being in breach over that and i am sorry if i went a little too far <e> <s> the government figures themselves have revealed that as many as young people in care may be detained in this way for varying periods in the course of a year <e> <s> there is no younger age limit and the childrens legal centre in their survey revealed that some children as young as are detained in this way <e> <s> at the report stage on th july in columns and of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble minister concludes he has not referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i wonder if he is going to accept that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have the opportunity to respond as these are my amendments <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken their contributions have shown that we are <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> of course i appreciate that the judiciary the magistracy and the probation organisations have been consulted and i do not think that i can press this amendment in the light of that <e> <s> i remain very sceptical and think that in fact people will not go into custody if this does not remain <e> <s> but in the light of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend lord melchett has answered the minister extremely well <e> <s> there is nothing more for me to add <e> <s> i endorse every word he said <e> <s> there is no proof that a certain amount of harm could be done <e> <s> a great many things can do harm <e> <s> many of the drugs that people take could do harm to the system <e> <s> that drugs can do harm is a very poor argument <e> <s> the overwhelming argument is that there is not a case for sending people to prison for simple possession <e> <s> i therefore press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the resources which are being put into this scheme by the government mean that there will be less resources for capitation for hooks and for other equipment where already there are tremendous shortages and cutbacks <e> <s> i am well aware of the million which is being put in but even so resources are very much less than they should be <e> <s> secondly may i ask the minister whether one microcomputer in each primary school which can be quite large in size will be adequate particularly for the girls to have a chance <e> <s> i am told that where there are microcomputers very often the boys elbow out the girls <e> <s> we understand that girls are getting hehindhand in some of this training so will there be enough microcomputers for the girls to have a fair chance too <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that not very satisfactory reply <e> <s> is he aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government paying particular attention to recommendation which says that the school examination system should <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has spoken already of the need for an early spring so i will not repeat that <e> <s> but i would ask the minister whether there can be wide publicity given to this new clause and particularly to the criteria <e> <s> it seems a pity that those criteria cannot be got out to local authorities but i feel sure that in some publication they can be drawn to the attention of local authorities so that they know what parliament expects <e>", "<cs> my lords has the effect on the flora and fauna of the area been carefully considered <e> <s> i genuinely do not know the answer and it is a slightly different question from the effect on the general environment <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no mention of education in the gracious speech <e> <s> one can be relieved that there is no promise of legislation to enable student loans or a voucher system to be set up <e> <s> there was an article by mr edward heath in tuesdays <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down <e> <s> i believe that i am the only person to whose speech he did not refer in his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was in fact absent from the chamber during the first part of my speech and so possibly he will honour me with a letter responding to some of the points i made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the recent youth service report which was published only about four weeks ago made a case for much more political education for young people <e> <s> and surely peace studies would come within the general realm of political education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all extremely grateful to the noble viscount lord rochdale for initiating this debate on what is really an extremely fascinating subject <e> <s> i must apologise from these benches because we had hoped that the noble lord lord gregson the noble lord lord scanlon or the noble lord lord mccarthy would be able to be here tonight to speak from these benches <e> <s> unfortunately they all had previous engagements which they could not postpone <e> <s> therefore it has fallen to my lot to speak for my party on this subject <e> <s> in fact i am rather pleased about it because as the noble viscount pointed out this debate does in a way complement the debate which i initiated just about a year ago <e> <s> so for my part i am delighted to be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i did say that a great many second-class degree graduates had gone in far more than firsts <e> <s> the numbers were considerable i have them and i will give them to the noble lord later <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether in fact ministers are to make decisions in these matters since i understood that the ncc was to have responsibility for them <e> <s> i thought that fwag the farming and wildlife advisory group was told that ministers would not be interfering in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that answer does she particularly as an ex-minister of state for education think it was satisfactory that the local authority associations which provide the education were not consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords as mr david young of the manpower services commission has said in an article that he wrote in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also congratulate the minister on his first appearance at the dispatch box particularly as i understand that he is undertaking education <e> <s> is he aware of a paper from the director-general of the national economic development council on education in industry where he is highly critical of the training given in schools as being inadequate for industry and engineering <e> <s> he comments particularly unfavourably on the examination system with its academic orientation and also on teachers inexperience of industry <e> <s> will any note be taken of this particularly in regard to the examination system <e> <s> i understand that decisions are still to be taken about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the paper by the director-general to which i referred appeared only in november and that he particularly referred to the -plus examinations <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness the minister not approve of a well-balanced political education being provided in our schools not indoctrination in any way but a balanced study of political education <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we do not want censorship and that if anyone is anxious about what is coming in it is up to the head and the governors to decide what is suitable or not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that it is not the government that is bringing in the new housing and building control bill <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the chief whip has spoken in this way and that he is willing to look at this question again because we have a certain sympathy with my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> obviously we shall leave the subject now but it can be discussed further on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he please tell me how many recommendations they made whether their recommendations were followed and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware

certain misgivings about taking part in these rather long debates when there is to be no vote at the end to keep members here and to keep up the interest <e> <s> today however we have had an extremely lively and interesting debate with many different contributions <e> <s> i hope that the government will take note of our debate <e> <s> it has been particularly satisfactory to have had the maiden speech of the noble lord lord pennock with which i find myself in very substantial agreement <e> <s> in almost every area there is a need for change in our educational system <e> <s> the governments policies are not working out as they would really wish them to do <e>", "<cs> my lords it cannot have been from the ugc <e> <s> i have the source but i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only express extreme dissatisfaction with that answer <e> <s> in october i was told by the noble lord lord elton that there would be an early statement <e> <s> three months later i am told that it will be soon <e> <s> it is not a satisfactory situation <e> <s> may i say that a great many people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he realises how many people who work in the adult education field and indeed in the field of further education the -to -year-old field and the field of special education are very worried that the government are taking this so lightly that they have made no statement within months on all the comments coming in on this document <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister why it is possible to make absolutely snap decisions about the education of -to -year-olds that can be done almost overnight when this matter has been neglected for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one computer in a secondary school which may have as many as pupils or even one computer in a class of is not really of very much use <e> <s> it is not much use having the computer if you do not have the softwear or the staff <e> <s> of course the same goes for primary schools one computer is not enough <e> <s> what the government have done is really just a gimmick <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that less money will be available for helping students this year and next year because the financial assistance fund which is operated by the open university itself which it takes out of the des grant is going to be able to produce per cent <e> <s> less this year than it did before <e> <s> also the half million which of course they are glad to have again will not be worth quite half a million this time and the half a million last year was fully taken up <e> <s> so overall there will be less money and i think it is accepted that the increase in fees has deterred some students <e> <s> there were students assisted by the financial assistance fund in and in <e> <s> would the noble earl accept that there is a very great need to help this particular class of student a little more <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord strabolgi may i say that i know that he is very pleased that this has happened and i would say how grateful we are to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his full reply <e> <s> i am doubtful about the amount of extra work that would be involved <e> <s> i shall look forward to his letter about whether planning would be affected <e> <s> the best thing is to read what is in <e>", "<cs> i spoke to when moving <e> <s> i intended to withdraw both of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has made exactly the point that i was going to make <e> <s> the giving of discretionary grants varies very much in different parts of the country so that the best may not necessarily get the awards <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the waldegrave plan which was referred to in the educational press at the beginning of last month with a great many details about what was to be done with the grants system some people would benefit the minimum grant would be abolished and so on is being seriously considered by the government or are they going to come up with some quite different plan <e> <s> or was the parliamentary under-secretary talking very freely at that moment <e>", "<cs> asked her majestys government <e>", "<cs> asked her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and of course one gives it a welcome <e> <s> we are delighted to hear that the government believe that it is right and in our interest to encourage students from abroad which is of course what we have been saying for a very long time <e> <s> it has in fact taken the government four years to conclude

their study <e> <s> in the meantime the fees for overseas students have been put up by per cent <e> <s> and that was announced very recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the minister a little about the question on the department <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to noble lords to hear that we on these benches have no affection for the assisted places scheme <e> <s> a number of noble lords who were here during the long committee stage of the bill will remember our efforts to delete clause from the bill <e> <s> unfortunately we were unsuccessful <e> <s> clause did not have unquestioning support even from the tory benches as the minister who was there during most of the committee stage will probably remember <e> <s> i remember some queries and comments from lord butler of saffron walden at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords how many of the pupils who have assisted places are transferred at the age of and how many and year-olds now have assisted places <e>",

situation then more inflexible than it was <e> <s> when i was last asking questions on this subject a -hour course for instance was allowed to be taken and supplementary benefit was not lost <e> <s>

easter leavers are allowed to draw supplementary benefit and when summer leavers are allowed to draw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be expected to be satisfied with that reply <e> <s> can we take it that the government the des and the ministers really do not intend to give any response to all the consultations and comments that have been going into the department and have been there now for much more than six months <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first congratulate the noble viscount lord boyd of merton on being so lucky as to have his name drawn out of the hat at this propitious moment just before the governments statement and the policy document and i gather that the draw was made in front of the television cameras too <e> <s> i am also delighted that the noble viscount did not withdraw his motion because there is a lot to be said about the document which after all is all about how the fees are going to be reduced and how they are going to be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that once one examination is fixed on we have been waiting for that for a very long time that will ease the problem because at least there will be only one examination at -plus for everybody <e> <s> will she agree further that this whole problem will be resolved if there is no examination at -plus and a new system of profiles and assessment is taken up <e>", "<cs> my lords will that survey cover the london borough of merton which apparently has ceased to provide any meals at all except sandwiches for those who must have free meals <e> <s> i should have thought that sandwiches for those having free meals was a totally inadequate diet <e> <s> could that borough please be covered by the survey if it is not already <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are closed how much choice are the parents going to have about where the children go <e> <s> i have in my hand a document from a parent from a primary school in cambridgeshire saying that if the school is closed the children are automatically going to be bussed four and a half miles and that parents do not like it <e> <s> how much parental choice is there there <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the technical colleges and further education colleges will be ready to provide the educational part of the scheme next september <e> <s> from what i hear there is considerable confusion about what they are expected to do and there are constantly changing instructions and requests <e> <s> there seems to be much anxiety and confusion within the colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> of course our final comment on it will have to wait until we have had the opportunity to read the white paper <e> <s> naturally we are in favour of the highest quality in our teaching force and of better selection and assessment of teachers during their training and indeed during their probationary period <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to clear up two points <e> <s> on the consultations do i understand that the teachers unions were not consulted at all about this which is really all about teachers apart from those who happen to be on acset and that the local education authorities which are being required to do various things in the statement were not consulted <e> <s> secondly is the million which the minister said is earmarked for in-service training earmarked for something within the general rate support grant or is it as a specific grant for in-service training <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that there are some local authorities which are not providing a service except for children who have to have free meals <e> <s> may i ask him how those children will be kept secret so to speak <e> <s> the intention is is it not that they should not be recognised as having free meals <e> <s> if no other children are having free meals how is this to be achieved <e> <s> could the minister say what the departments view is about what is going to happen to those children who could possibly be wandering around the streets at lunchtime <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that if the government had not brought pressure on local authorities to cut expenditure on school meals by per cent <e> <s> within a short period of two years the situation would not have been as difficult as it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords if this voucher scheme were brought in can the minister say how it would agree with section <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not consider that the many empty classrooms now in our primary schools because of falling rolls make it an admirable time to increase the provision of nursery classes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for putting down this question even late on a thursday about the very important matter of books <e> <s> i do not know whether i ought to declare an interest but i have recently succeeded lord roll of ipsden as chairman of the national book committee and my husband is a retired publisher <e> <s> i was very proud to have myself described as a friend of the book when i opened an exhibition of childrens books at the national book league last summer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the minister for a moment <e> <s> for a long time the price of books was kept below the general cost of inflation <e> <s> it was only in the rather desperate situation of the last year or two that it caught up <e> <s> it was kept down for a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for asking this question tonight on an extremely important subject a subject which i think will become increasingly important over the next few years <e> <s> it also gives us an opportunity to hear the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> we look forward to it <e> <s> it gives us too an opportunity to congratulate acace on its remarkable achievements in the years since it was set up in <e> <s> it has published well-researched reports as well as a number of considered responses to educational documents which have appeared during that time <e> <s> of those reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> the fact that the secretary of state has had to make such a statement today is because of the crisis which the government caused when they decided to charge full cost fees <e> <s> that is when students found themselves in real difficulty <e> <s> the shock of the scarman judgment has jolted the government into action though it has taken four months since the judgment for a statement to be made and many people have been waiting for that <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was criticising the government for was putting up the fees making the fees full-cost fees <e> <s> that is what caused the crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn and i both asked when the further announcement would be made about the fees <e> <s> i also asked whether the polytechnics and the colleges would get compensation for loss of income in the same way as the universities <e> <s> i went on to ask whether the fourth paragraph of the statement meant that anyone intending to take up permanent residence even if they had not been here for three years would be entitled to an award <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his full and fast exposition of this bill we clearly are in a great hurry today and indeed for his explanation about the draft regulations too <e> <s> i should also like to thank him and his officials for having sent me a copy of the draft regulations <e> <s> we on these benches will give support to the bill now that certain assurances have been given although as i have warned the noble earl i shall have one or two questions to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me the government had four and a half months in which to consider it <e> <s> we are being left with a whole days or so between the first reading in another place and the bill being passed here <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to mention one assurance which i sought but which he has not given <e> <s> if the government are returned will the new regulations be laid by the first week in july <e> <s> i understand that an assurance was given in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords so do we because i think that this is a monstrous task to have to ask anyone to undertake <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but does he not think that the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords following up the ministers answer to my noble friend lord stewart of fulham has the minister considered the educational and financial case for continuing certain activities of the schools council that it has already embarked upon and letting them go on until march <e> <s> there is still uncertainty about this <e> <s> if not there will be a good deal of educational and financial loss as a considerable amount of money has been put into the council <e> <s> the extra money to continue there until march would i understand be in the region of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister if when this report is being discussed another report which has just appeared recently by i think the dean of oxford polytechnic could also be studied <e> <s> i understand that in that report the evidence is that at least we can be thankful that there is no evidence of children copying any violent action <e> <s> it seems to me that the most worrying thing in this report is <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has answered a great many questions that i have asked but there is one important one that he has not answered <e> <s> it is what is to happen about withdrawing benefits from those who are reluctant to go on the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long debate and i shall not speak for more than a minute or two <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lords and the many noble baronesses who have taken part in this discussion of what i think is an extremely important subject <e> <s> i must make one comment <e> <s> i was rather amused to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister for an assurance that those young people who are unemployed and who have not taken up places in the scheme will not have their supplementary benefit of a week cut if they do not take up places <e> <s> this was threatened in a circular to local government earlier in the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very full reply but it leaves a good many questions unanswered <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards that point is the minister aware that according to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether improvement grants will be freely available under the urban programme <e> <s> because there was a statement recently that money for local authorities improvement grants was going to be cut back severely <e>", "<cs> my lords how long does an application to the department for a new instrument take from the time that the department receives it until the time that it is agreed and the answer goes back <e> <s> is the department trying to hurry the process up in the light of the governments strong pressure for parent involvement in every aspect of school life <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister know that in the magazine <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i assume from the noble baronesss reply that some young people are being reported for failing to take up places on the youth training scheme and also that there are some so-called premature terminations <e> <s> will the noble baroness perhaps be kind enough to find a different word for this as premature termination is not a very suitable description for people who come off the courses <e> <s> will she tell her ministers that the careers officers are finding it very unpleasant to be involved in peaching on their clients when they are supposed to work by co-ordination rather than coercion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to tell the other ministers involved that the careers officers are worried that form uby which has to be used by those young people who have prematurely terminated their courses is extremely complicated and difficult to fill in for those not particularly bright in the head <e> <s> can something a little simpler be produced for them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that local authorities are keen to run these courses in many cases but find it rather difficult because of the cut-back in educational expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how many community homes with education have been closed and whether it is likely that more will be closed <e> <s> because the one with which i am involved as a governor has now people at it when it has places for and the facilities and teaching are excellent <e> <s> even though the courts cannot send the young people directly there the courts can put the young people into the care of the local authority which can then send them to the community homes with education <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that not only are more young people receiving youth custody sentences but also many more are in secure accommodation since the implementation of the criminal justice act <e> <s> i made local enquiries <e> <s> i found that in five months before implementation of the act no boys were in secure accommodation in my county <e> <s> in the five months since the implementation of the act boy-days have been spent in secure accommodation <e> <s> this is very unfortunate in every way and also from the point of view of cost <e> <s> it costs a week to keep a boy in such accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that moderately reassuring reply <e> <s> however would he not agree that any restrictions of that type would make no logical or educational sense for teachers of primary schools <e> <s> indeed would it really make much difference whether the first degree was in mediaeval history architecture philosophy or social anthropology <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister ask the secretary of state and his colleagues to make quite <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for the absence tonight of my noble friend lord john-mackie <e> <s> he had accepted the estimate of time for the somerset house debate and the shipping industry debate and expected that this debate would be over by eight oclock <e> <s> he had a commitment at that time which he could not avoid so i am taking his place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a great many local authorities will find themselves in grave financial difficulties because of the msc paying for places occupied and not for places prepared <e> <s> for instance i have the figures for nottinghamshire <e> <s> they prepared for places and were taken up so there will be a great shortfall in the fee income <e> <s> they estimate that it might be as much as <e> <s> other authorities are in the same <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he has given a great deal of attention to the curriculum of the per cent <e> <s> of pupils who are not attaining any qualifications when they leave <e> <s> will the narrowness of the curriculum be widened so that there are more opportunities for these young people <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask the minister for a little more information are there any particular regions of the country which have received most of the benefit from the many grants which he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for what i consider to be quite a favourable response <e> <s> however according to the original amendment it was first printed on th december <e> <s> it was not really a last minute amendment <e> <s> i do not apologise for it being near the end <e> <s> it was put down at quite a reasonable time <e> <s> i am pleased with the response of the noble and learned lord which i think is fairly favourable <e> <s> i shall look forward perhaps to a more technically correct amendment being put down by the government at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that the number of books issued and the amount of stock does not bear any relation to the number of new books bought <e> <s> does he also agree that individual authorities have made cuts of over per cent <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> and over per cent <e> <s> in their book funds over the past five years <e> <s> is he aware that of library authorities have made some cut back <e> <s> the books that have been in the library for some time of course will be more tatty and not really of very good quality <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although book prices have gone up faster than the retail price index in the past five years this is partly because they were held down below the retail price index in the previous five years and that of course when fewer new books are being bought that is a contributory factor to the price particularly of hardbacks and monographs going up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the minister to take seriously this decline in public library services and particularly in the school library service <e> <s> will he take note of recent hmi reports <e> <s> there is a constant emphasis in them of the difficulty experienced by schools from the shortage of books <e> <s> they have to cope with that <e> <s> the school library service which is part of the public library service very often needs to be maintained in the way that it has not been in the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to say who is giving the instruction at these centres and whether local colleges of further education are providing the teaching or is it coming from a different source <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the bill <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister for his speedy explanation of the bill which is the fifth education bill this government have introduced since they took office in <e> <s> i have been spokesman for the opposition from these benches on each occasion <e> <s> i think this is the first time the noble earl has taken an education bill through all its stages in this house <e> <s> i do not really count the minutes we spent on the education fees and awards bill one afternoon last may just before the last election <e> <s> so i congratulate him on that and i am quite sure that from our opposing benches with our opposite views we shall get on very amicably <e> <s> whether as a member of a local authority for many years and as a member of an education committee he can be so totally enthusiastic for the bill as he appears to be i do wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to say that i said when i was speaking that i sympathised with the frustration of secretaries of state that when they have put money into the rate support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and i understand from it that local authorities are not obliged to pay fees in a further education establishment <e> <s> would he not agree that it is an anomaly that a local authority should be obliged to provide education in a school for to year-olds but should not be obliged to provide for what may be an absolutely identical course in a further education establishment <e> <s> would he not agree that there should be no statutory bias towards one form of provision or another and that they should be on all fours <e> <s> does he not think that young people should be able to choose freely which sort of education they are taking between to whether in a school or at a fe or tertiary college <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the drill of my questions is towards asking for some sort of legislation about further education for which i have asked many times before <e> <s> there are so many anomalies <e> <s> sections and of the act mean that parents have a choice about where their children whether post- or under the age of go to school <e> <s> they can also appeal <e> <s> this is not so if they wish their children to go to a further education college <e> <s> the same applies to recoupment <e> <s> it is essential if it is a school but it is not essential for another authority to pay if it is for further education <e> <s> could the minister please press for early legislation to put these anomalies right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that there is to be a meeting but is the noble viscount aware that the problems of over-commitment arose from the mscs regional and area planning figures <e> <s> a good many authorities took those figures as a firm basis on which to plan their own provisions <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware of the fact that the additional expenditure which will be incurred because of this is extremely substantial <e> <s> in devon it is berkshire hampshire and nottinghamshire <e> <s> only one of these i may say is a labour-controlled authority <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a final plea to the noble viscount as we are lucky enough to have him in his very powerful position answering this question to be generous to the local authorities <e> <s> their feelings have been ruffled by what has been going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there will be a positive education training element in the young workers scheme for the year-olds and if so how long will that education element be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord for having carried out his commitment to put down an amendment of this sort <e> <s> i had not envisaged that it would take about four pages to do it and i quite understand why it was not ready for report <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord knows that i put down the amendment at the instigation of a friend who is a solicitor and who works in the domestic court a great deal <e> <s> the noble and learned lord having kindly sent me the amendments in manuscript form i sent them on to her <e> <s> she says she is entirely satisfied with what has been done and is glad that the opportunity has been taken to do a tidying-up operation <e> <s> she says that the new clause will be very much easier to follow than the old one so i can only express my gratitude for what has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his very brief explanation of the amendments to these regulations <e> <s> they seem to me perhaps a little more than procedural as he said at the beginning <e> <s> the noble earl well knows the attitude of the opposition to the assisted places scheme because i think he took part in all stages of the discussion on the education act so it will be no surprise that i do not really receive these amendments very warmly <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would allow me to interrupt i obtained my figure of per cent <e> <s> from the speech of the minister when he was introducing the regulations in another place so if i am incorrect it is because he was incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow that up and ask whether that means that the money for the scheme in the next year that is or in will still be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in the training of students it would be a great help to them if the respective roles of the education welfare services and the social services were defined more clearly so that when they begin teaching in schools teaching mixed ethnic races as well as children with home deprivation they will know where they can apply for help <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of how very frustrating it is for visitors to cambridge as i know is the case knowing that the museum is open from oclock to oclock on tuesdays and saturdays and half day on sundays to arrive there in the morning wanting to see the pictures and finding that the picture galleries are not open until oclock <e>", "<cs> some of the points made by the noble baroness lady cox and the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill have i think been answered very well by the noble lords lord kilmarnock and lord stewart <e> <s> so far as the expenditure per pupil is concerned i believe that this gives an unreal picture because when there are falling rolls probably as many teachers have to remain and so the pupil/teacher ratio is not really a fair judgment of the money that is being spent altogether <e>", "<cs> to respond to what the noble baroness lady cox said about delay i hope there will be some delay because some delay is written into clause <e> <s> i think the comments in <e>", "<cs> if i may add one word about this group of amendments there seems to be a great deal to be said for certainty in the amount of grant and that <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble earl could say something more about the slow build-up he mentioned <e> <s> if the secretary of state is so keen on innovation in the curriculum and experiment why is he taking these powers to himself in this bill and then deciding not to use them for several years <e> <s> i gather that in the debates in committee in another place the minister mr dunn said perhaps there might be only one scheme at first <e> <s> it does seem to me the most extraordinary behaviour to take the power and then do <e>", "<cs> i find it rather strange that the noble baroness lady cox should say that it is unlikely that money will be left over <e> <s> on a previous amendment we heard that there was going to be a very slow build-up and that there might be only one or two projects in the first year <e> <s> so i do not see that that quite matches <e>", "<cs> i should like to read carefully what the minister has said and if i am not satisfied with his reply i can come back on report <e> <s> but for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am very satisfied with the noble earls response <e> <s> it seems to me that it would not be difficult to make this an area which could be disregarded in relation to the penalties <e> <s> if there are not going to be targets and penalties in then this matter will not come into it <e> <s> however in case there are to be such targets and penalties i think that while we are discussing the bill it would be wise to have this safeguard so that there is no danger of the balance of the expenditure on the grant the per cent <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> or whatever it may be just tipping them over the edge <e> <s> therefore i should like to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for the support which this amendment has had from all sides of the committee <e> <s> as i said when i moved it it is a probing amendment and of course i can add and as well as the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i think that all these amendments are intended to be probing <e> <s> i thought that the reply was quite sympathetic and owing to the number of people who have spoken to this amendment i think that there is a strong case for some of the money being put to this cause <e> <s> so i hope that the minister will take that back to his friends in the department <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be a help if i say at this stage that i accept the amendment to my amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say first of all that this is only an advisory board which is being proposed <e> <s> it is not going to do more than advise <e> <s> the authorities do very much want to be consulted <e> <s> as the secretary of state has agreed that he will have consultations that they are in

delhi not to make any further significant increases in overseas students fees without consulting our commonwealth partners is the minister able to say that any future recommendations about fee levels will be made only after consultation with the relevant government departments and with our commonwealth partners <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether this improvement about which of course we are all pleased has come about partly because the rolls have fallen more slowly than teachers have been got rid of <e> <s> this is borne out by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask one or two questions <e> <s> they will probably be stupid ones because it is very much easier to ask questions after one has read what the noble earl has said <e> <s> am i to understand that

distributed to all local authorities or will there be any method of carry-over <e> <s> if authorities have bid but they have not been able to spend all of the money in one year and they wish to carry on with their schemes will they be able to carry that money over to the second year <e> <s> how will that be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not in fact vote on this particular amendment we voted

the bill through your lordships house so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am not at all surprised at the response which we have had to this amendment but equally i have no apologies at all for putting it forward because i think that it is good that the secretary of state should know the views of a great many of us who are very interested in caring about education on matters which we feel are extremely important and particularly as apparently he has changed his mind considerably between the appearance at the first consultation document and second reading debate in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a great many words from the minister opposite and i think some of the same words we had last time although we did not have the suggestion that this advisory body would soon be spawning large numbers of subgroups and creating unnecessary and undesirable bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister has rather missed one of the points

we <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a few words about this <e> <s> at second reading i said that this bill though short and of limited aims was important because of its implications for

education authority directly accountable to the people of inner london <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn i should like to say i was not quite so happy with the ministers reply as the noble

alarming <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether it is to be a green paper or a white paper <e> <s> he said at first that it would be a green paper and then later he said that it would

consideration <e> <s> would the noble earl not agree that any effective comparison of institutions must be based on concepts of unit cost including the question of examination success <e>", "<cs> my

lords is the minister aware that your lordships committee on science and technology in a report which was debated only on monday recommended a vast expansion of distance learning and that the open university should be able to give it <e> <s> would he not agree that it is an expansion of funds and not a contraction which is needed at the moment if we are to help our industry to revive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his rapid explanation of the bill <e> <s> we wish from these benches to give a general welcome to this small bill which enlarges the powers of local authorities to enable maintained and further and higher education establishments to embark on commercial activities as described in paragraph of the consultative document <e> <s> this is preferable to the other option described in paragraph of that consultative document which would have given appropriate local authority institutions corporate status as limited companies <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister is speaking about financial arrangements can he give me an answer as to whether the institution will be able to carry on the gain or loss from one year to another the roll-over principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for explaining the regulations <e> <s> i agree that it is convenient to have the amended regulations all together in one place along with what remains of the old ones <e> <s> one cannot object to the changes that have been made <e> <s> however as the noble earl may remember i was very critical last year of the relaxation in the conditions governing applications for assisted places since the first regulations were laid in so that more pupils could more easily be syphoned off to private establishments <e> <s> the safeguards that had been written into the bill were being gradually whittled away <e> <s> there do not seem to have been any more changes of that sort this year to make it easier for pupils to transfer i am glad to say <e> <s> that does not mean that i can give a general welcome to the regulations because our opposition to the scheme remains as strong as ever <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minster tell me how well women are represented in part-time engineering and technical courses at polytechnics and universities <e> <s> part-time courses are sometimes very much easier for women to attend <e> <s> are the government going to encourage more part-time courses <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady cox on her first appearance at the dispatch box on an educational matter <e> <s> i agree that she put up a spirited defence of the bill but she is going to need all her intelligence and ingenuity to put up a further defence after the lively and strong criticisms that there have been of the bill during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords he has imposed the tvei scheme which has taken from the local authorities the power to decide what goes on in the schools <e> <s> he has taken away per cent <e> <s> of the money for the non-advanced further education <e> <s> i am sure that i could think of other examples if i were to continue <e> <s> there certainly have been quite a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether there will be in the bill an overriding power so that local authorities which have banned corporal punishment can stick to that whatever the governing bodies of their schools may say <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give wide publicity to the british accreditation council for independent further and higher education establishments which has been in being for about six months and which is doing the work that was previously done by the department of education and science <e> <s> it produces lists of establishments which are accredited and that would be a great help to everybody concerned both in this country and abroad <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord lord chelwood in two respects first that education is perhaps the most important service that any local authority has to provide and secondly that we want a system of voting which is simple to understand <e> <s> however i would suggest that possibly stv is not such a system <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord houghton that we want to be quite sure that the system to which we move is better than what we have now <e> <s> i think that the proposals made in the amendment are very likely not better than what we have now <e>", "<cs> secondly if this is thought desirable should the stv system be the alternative to adopt <e> <s> thirdly is amending this legislation the way in which to deal with a major constitutional change affecting our electoral law <e> <s> in my view the answer to all three questions must be no <e>", "<cs> it is difficult for the people of london or anywhere else to be presented with two different voting papers in the same polling station and be asked to work those two systems <e> <s> if one has contested local elections one knows how often people are very confused when they get to the polling stations anyway and i think this would really be too difficult <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say this <e> <s> i think that is not so under the bill as it stands at the moment <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt about where the weight of the argument has been in the debate on this amendment so ably moved by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london who really said everything that needed to be said about it <e> <s> i think that perhaps one could disregard the rather extraordinary outburst of the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> if i may say so i think the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> we shall be able to look tomorrow <e> <s> i disagree very much with the noble lords reading of the bill about primary legislation needing to be brought to parliament before the ilea can really be abolished or broken up entirely <e> <s> i understand i have the support of the right reverend prelate on that <e> <s> we shall be interested to hear what the government have to say in reply <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised by what the noble earl says because by deleting subsection the secretary of state is prevented from determing <e>", "<cs> the aim of amendment no <e> <s> is to make as wide and varied as possible the activities that can be undertaken by further education establishments as a result of the passing of the bill <e> <s> clause appears to be rather more narrowly drafted than the various supporting papers sent out for comment before the bill finally appeared <e> <s> the original consultative document listed the following six headings of activities which would be able to be undertaken by polytechnics and colleges contracted research exploitation of inventions co-operative research with industry consultancy work routine testing and advisory services <e>", "<cs> i am not of course surprised by the answer the minister gave but he made a comment about commercial activities intruding <e> <s> i thought that the whole point was to make commercial activities possible <e> <s> i shall have to read what the minister said tomorrow to make sure that i heard and understood him aright <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a help <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether the noble earl referred to paragraph <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that the advice that i have received from various quarters is that it would be a great improvement <e> <s> i have noted what the minister has said about consultation with local authority associations later in the week <e> <s> i hope that the discussions that we have tonight will make those <e>", "<cs> being interested in language i am pleased to hear various definitions of facilitate and that in response to the last amendment the word facilitate was used <e> <s> this will require a good deal of study but at least i was pleased that the minister said that at any rate under clause <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear that there is some confusion about this and that it needs looking at again <e> <s> it is quite clear from the advice that i have had and the requests that i have had to raise this point that a lot of people are not at all clear what it means <e> <s> i do not think that we have solved the problem in the course of these exchanges <e> <s> but if the minister is prepared to say that he will look at it again and that he will either write to me or bring forward his own amendment at report stage i shall now be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but i should like his assurance that he is prepared to do that before i do so <e>", "<cs> on that half assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i need hardly say how delighted i am to have achieved something <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised by the interpretation put on what i though was a fairly simple amendment <e> <s> again i shall certainly have to read what the minister has said and decide whether i am convinced by his arguments and whether it will be necessary for me to return to this at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the bill goes into what happens when there is a deficit at the end of the year but although the des commentary indicates that it is the intention of the bill to aid public sector institutions to gain funds the present bill does not even indicate that earned funds may be used for educational purposes <e> <s> i should like to quote from paragraph of the commentary which starts by dealing with the deficit situation but goes on <e>", "<cs> it seems odd to me that the bill says that deficits shall be charged <e> <s> that seems to be absolutely firm <e> <s> i am very glad about what the minister said about the intentions of the bill that the gains should be used for the establishment <e> <s> but i am still a little mystified that the deficit is dealt with but not the profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> could he perhaps persuade his right honourable friend to say something a little more positive and helpful about the package he wants and in a little more detail <e> <s> when his right honourable friend speaks of assessment and appraisal could he perhaps link them with staff development and in-service training and not give the impression that they are a form of punishment which is how it sometimes comes over <e> <s> it is very important that encouragement should be given to the teaching profession if it is hoped to attract and keep able people in that profession <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please recognise that assessment linked with merit awards is exactly what offends the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i was aware of the report that is to come from the institute of education but is it not a fact that that report is not due to be published until <e> <s> that really is quite a long time off <e> <s> is the minister satisfied in view of the fact that authorities have not sent in their returns for the number of children with statements although those returns should have been in by january last <e> <s> is the minister certain that those authorities are implementing the act properly <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give a figure for the number of children ascertained as being handicapped now who are in ordinary schools <e> <s> the last figure i could find was from january <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating that statement <e>", "<cs> i think in fact it is just a slightly different issue from the main issue so it was preferred that they were taken separately <e>", "<cs> clearly there are many problems which have to be resolved <e> <s> the noble earl has given a long reply <e>", "<cs> long compared with my speech in moving the amendment <e> <s> i shall read what the noble earl has to say <e> <s> i am not convinced by his arguments <e> <s> a new authority should have a chance to be treated responsibly and be allowed to make its own plans <e> <s> after that time if it has behaved as the noble earl put it irresponsibly then something should happen <e> <s> however it should be given a chance during its first three years to be trusted and to have a real opportunity to prove itself <e> <s> however for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord must have reduced his brief very cleverly if it really was a very long one <e> <s> it does seem maybe that there is a better chance being given to the new ilea than i had thought <e> <s> i should not like to commit myself on that until i have had a chance to read what he has said tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> i am referring to that part of county hall which is now occupied by ilea not the entire complex <e>", "<cs> i was trying to say that the buildings that are there now have been paid for by the ratepayers of london and therefore the ratepayers of london should have some say and benefit if anything is done with those buildings other than to use them for their present purposes <e> <s> but i should like to ask the minister whether when this feasibility study is made proper consideration will be given to the whole infrastructure that the glc gives to ilea at the moment that is all these others architects engineers maintenance staff committee clerks and so on who are provided by the glc and used by the ilea so that they need to have a great deal of accommodation besides that which is particularly the ilea officers accommodation <e> <s> i should like to ask whether all that will be given proper consideration when this feasibility study is made <e>", "<cs> i have had some assurances but i should like to read what the minister has said when it is printed in the <e>", "<cs> for the same reason as the noble and learned lord lord denning has given i support this amendment <e> <s> i am sorry to say that we are left with a bill which we consider to be unworkable and i think it is our duty during the rest of this committee stage to try to make the bill that little bit better more understandable and perhaps rather safer in its working <e>", "<cs> i ask the minister to take this back for further consideration <e> <s> she has heard what the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord airedale have said and there clearly is dissatisfaction with the wording in the subsection <e> <s> i should be extremely pleased if she was willing to take it away and possibly write to me or come back with her own amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too had great difficulty in understanding this subsection <e> <s> i took the advice of two noble and learned lords in this house yesterday <e> <s> their advice to me was that this subsection makes the situation worse than it is at the present moment and that it gives much greater protection to teachers who beat children when they should not than they would get at the present time <e> <s> it seems to me wrong that the bill should be doing that if that is what in fact it means <e> <s> i think we all want some clarification on this <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness if she cannot explain it will take it back and try to redraft it <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to the noble countess lady mar that teachers would be perfectly all right if they prevented a child from burning itself or doing damage <e> <s> that would not come into the question at all <e> <s> i still feel it is very distasteful for corporal punishment however described and it is described as a battering in the bill to be applied to children under five <e> <s> however i will read what the noble baroness has said and reserve the right to come back on this at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is one other point we ought to remember when talking about teachers of children with statements <e> <s> it is that children are now being integrated in normal schools and possibly even faster than they should be because the teachers there to receive them may not have had the necessary training <e> <s> they may not understand as much as they should about children with handicaps whether those handicaps are slight or great <e>", "<cs> would not the noble baroness be willing to take this back to see whether it can be discussed with ministers to ascertain whether they can look more favourably on this amendment <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell me whether that review will be made public <e> <s> will it be finished by the time we reach the report stage of this bill <e>", "<cs> in the light of that information i think it would be wrong to press this amendment at the moment <e> <s> but it is one that we feel very strongly about and so it will certainly come back at report stage unless there is some favourable information reaching us before then <e> <s> at the moment i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i spoke to this with the first amendment the abolition amendment <e> <s> the other reason i wished to speak to it was to try to find out what it meant <e> <s> that has been clarified a little at least i hope it will have been clarified by the amendment of the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> thus i shall not be speaking to this <e>", "<cs> in order to be absolutely clear do i take it that those local education authorities which have now banned corporal punishment in their schools will be able to stick to that whatever the governing body wants to do <e> <s> may i have a clear answer to that question <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall read very carefully all that the noble baroness has said and reserve the right to come back on report <e> <s> however for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> nothing that the noble baroness has said makes sure that letters will arrive and that they will be paid attention to <e> <s> it does nothing about the illiterate or those who do not understand the english language <e> <s> the only safe way is to have an opting-in rather than an opting-out measure <e> <s> i shall divide the committee on this <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i shall divide the house at this late hour <e> <s> i should like to read what the noble baroness said as there was quite a gap between her first reply and my speaking in reply now <e> <s> but my sympathies are very much with the noble lord lord beaumont in fact <e> <s> if it is there and it has to be done and we have this extraordinary bill why not put this into it <e> <s> but i shall read what has been said and if i feel inclined i can come back at report stage and scotland can decide what it does about making the wording right <e>", "<cs> as i said when i moved the amendment schools and the leas have known of the governments proposals since july and so they really have had plenty of time to think what they are going to do <e> <s> i dare say that they should like to push the whole thought of the bill out of their minds as it is such a ridiculous bill and in that case they may not have made the preparations <e> <s> however i do not think that it is worth taking this matter any further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for the further explanation and i think i shall have to be satisfied with it <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reflect on it but of course i presume a decision will have to be made on the governments amendment very shortly <e> <s> even so i should like to think about this and therefore i will beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i shall come back again on this at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him about one phrase which he used <e> <s> he said that an appropriate share of overheads would be taken into account <e> <s> presumably this means not quite the total amount of overheads <e> <s> i wonder whether he can clear that up <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a long answer and quite clearly i shall have to read and study it <e> <s> the minister has a rather curious idea about the wealth of local authorities with all this money which they wield everywhere when we know that they are all in a good deal of difficulty at the moment <e> <s> however i shall possibly come back to this at third reading because it is a very difficult part of the bill and i am not at all sure that it has been got right even with the governments amendment <e> <s> but i shall certainly consider what the noble earl has said and possibly come back at third reading with yet another suggestion <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an improvement on the bill as it was at the committee stage and for that we are grateful <e> <s> i am not quite sure that it goes far enough but we are content with it as far as it does go <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister has in fact put one of my worries at rest about whether if no agreement ever happened there could be trouble eventually and so i am very pleased to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the ministers undertaking relates to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very grateful to the minister for that undertaking <e> <s> i shall have to read what he said about amendment no <e> <s> concerning rates of interest and so on <e> <s> he probably has provided some reassurance but i shall certainly need to read his remarks before i can be absolutely certain on that point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i should like to consult on this with some of the people to whom i have talked in the local authority associations to see whether they are satisfied with what has been said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as teachers have been mentioned i will refer to their case <e> <s> the teachers did not go to arbitration because the secretary of state said quite categorically that there would be no more money <e> <s> there was no point in them taking that course <e>", "<cs> yet this clause obliges the new directly elected single service authority to put aside this mandate and to consult borough councils elected on separate political mandates to administer quite different services <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have one question for the minister before he sits down and before i come back finally on the amendment <e> <s> does not the minister agree that the consultation which the present ilea carries out is very elaborate and very complete and that it really does a much better job in that respect than many other authorities whether they be education authorities or anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made some concessions about this clause which we do not like <e> <s> in the light of that i should like to read what he has said and think about whether we can table an amendment to this clause at third reading <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tried on each occasion to leave out line or to amend it naturally i can do nothing but welcome this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for what the minister has achieved <e> <s> possibly we should have liked a little more leeway <e> <s> i think that the accounting provision will still cause a certain <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i have to say that i welcome this and am grateful for the government amendment <e> <s> the worry throughout this bill has been that the local authorities have not been trusted enough by the secretary of state and the government and this goes some way at any rate to meeting those considerations <e> <s> i think that possibly the secretary of state still appears just a little too much in the bill but this is certainly a great improvement and for that i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understand why we have to have this <e> <s> can the noble earl give a little more explanation why it has to be different for wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to withdraw it because of certain things that the noble earl has said <e> <s> there are some minor acts of interference in this bill which we do not like <e> <s> what i want is that this bill which deals with further education should be cited as one with the principal acts and that is the reason for moving this amendment <e> <s> i understand that in principle it is accepted and when this has had a little more consideration presumably it could be put into the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords with that assurance from the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this short bill has been changed quite considerably since it was introduced in the house two months ago and i believe changed for the better <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for listening to the criticisms we have made and the anxieties we have expressed about the bill as it was originally drafted <e> <s> although it is a small bill it will be of considerable importance to polytechnics and colleges of higher education and those who work within them <e> <s> i think that on the whole they and the local authority associations will be pleased and happier with the bill as it leaves the house than they were when it came in <e> <s> it has been amended at every stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her explanation of the amended regulations <e> <s> as the noble baroness well knows neither <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i interrupt there to clear up that point <e> <s> of course i realise that all authorities can bid but will all the authorities have the grant to follow the project <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to do any sort of in-service training after having qualified and taken the nneb course in order that those who have it can go on to other areas and have more responsibility in nursery schools nursery classes or day nurseries <e> <s> if so who would pay for that in-service training <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a not altogether unexpected reply <e> <s> is the minister aware that the other local authorities are very anxious about what the secretary of state will do as they feel that they may be million to million worse off as a result of the judgment <e> <s> will the noble baroness please convey that concern and does she have any comment to make <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness please encourage her right honourable friend the secretary of state to come to some decision possibly involving producing the money from the department itself which it seems to me would be the fairest way rather than make all the other local education authorities suffer as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for her explanation of the order and say that we agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long discussion on this amendment <e> <s> i have had a great deal of excellent support for it and i should particularly like to thank the noble lord lord henderson and my noble friends lady wootton and lord soper because they made the point about violence and the fact that we want to get rid of as much of that as we possibly can in this community <e> <s> if we support this amendment we shall be doing that little bit towards it <e> <s> i press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> is the secretary of state really going to be content to let this dispute go on by using his veto as he did yesterday <e> <s> the votes which his two des representatives have on the burnham committee and those of the five tory acc councillors could prevent the continuation of discussion which means that this dispute could run on into the autumn <e> <s> it is quite incredible that a secretary of state for education could be a party to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his words and i am very glad to hear that the secretary of state is willing to see the members of the panel the local authorities or the teachers either alone or together <e> <s> i very much hope that that will happen <e> <s> however i understand that the des did use its votes yesterday <e> <s> the des representatives used their votes with five tory members of the acc and they were able to defeat the others by one vote <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that it is not much use going to arbitration when the secretary of state said beforehand that he is not going to put any more money on the table to honour the decision which might be made <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pleased to agree with the commons amendments <e> <s> as the minister said i moved a similar amendment at third reading and i am very pleased to see that it is now incorporated in the bill and that the further education bill when enacted will be cited and construed as one with the other education acts <e> <s> i think that i wanted this amendment in at third reading partly because of another amendment that i was moving which i thought it would help but in fact that did not come about <e> <s> the other reason was that i thought that if the further education bill when it became an act had not been cited and construed as one with the other education acts then in a way it would rather lessen the standing of further education generally <e> <s> i think that this gives it the status that it should have <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl will know that i am very anxious that there should be a further further education bill which will do something about the legal basis of further education and there is still a long way to go <e> <s> i am pleased with this and grateful that it has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to make a comment on that business statement <e> <s> we are glad that the government have agreed with the judgment of this house and indeed with that of the local authority associations and teachers unions that the education corporal punishment bill was a ridiculous and unworkable bill and we are glad that it is not to become an act <e> <s> however we regret that the government have not thought fit to accept the amendment which was passed in this house on th july when there could then have been a sensible bill put on the statute book at the end of the session and parliamentary time would not have been wasted <e> <s> as it is i understand that parliamentary time will have to be devoted to it in the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether the des considers that the premises and data on which the national council for educational standards was working are entirely satisfactory <e> <s> will the noble earl agree that a more direct comparison between the abilities of pupils going into a school and the qualifications that they leave with as suggested by researchers at lancaster and sheffield universities would provide a fairer picture <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister just one question <e> <s> i am not quite clear whether this review which is still promised is to be undertaken by the three secretaries of state the secretary of state for education and science the secretary of state for health and social security and the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> if this is not to embrace all those three it does not seem to me that is to be a very satisfactory review <e> <s> also when is this review going to be with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his quite lengthy explanation and reception of what has been said by the three noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i still feel that it is not very satisfactory about the lateness of the laying of the regulations because although the leas may know roughly what the regulations are to contain they cannot do their detailed sums and get their grant cheques out to the students until they really know the fine detail <e> <s> that makes it very difficult not only administratively for the leas but also for the students who may not receive their cheques until too late <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement although i must express profound disappointment at the statement itself and indeed its tone <e> <s> the secretary of state is proposing nothing new nothing constructive to help to bring this very worrying dispute any nearer to a solution <e> <s> i fear that the attitude he takes up with the teachers can only alienate them <e> <s> we should like to express our sympathy to the teaching force which is a very professional body coping in a situation where resources are all too scarce <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that ultimately the education service is the responsibility of the secretary of state and that when things have come to as bad a pass as they have surely it is up to him to make a further move and do something <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a very satisfactory reply as four months have elapsed since the decision of this house <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the government are still intending to meet their international treaty obligations which the secretary for education said was the case when he introduced the corporal punishment bill in january of this year <e> <s> while i understand that nobody knows exactly what is happening will the minister say further whether any guidance is being given to the local education authorities or teachers who are in a very difficult and unsatisfactory situation as matters stand at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is one boy being kept out of school in warwickshire at this moment because his mother objects to him being caned and the headmaster will not have him back until he is willing to be caned and that this is the sort of situation that could be going on all over the country with education being disrupted while the government are being so backward in coming forward with some sensible legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether those tenants who are in receipt of supplementary benefit i understand that that concerns about per cent <e> <s> of council house tenants will be able to afford to benefit from the scheme or whether it will be only better-off tenants who will benefit <e> <s> by way of a second supplementary question may i ask will those local authorities which are already running very much simpler schemes than the one outlined by the government be free to carry on with their own schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his department has not only failed to make a <e>", "<cs> my lords finally may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is prepared to apply the strict criteria which were laid down in by john silkin i am sorry by lewis silkin when he was minister of town and country planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the answer to the private notice question <e> <s> i take it that the secretary of state is satisfied with affairs as far as they go <e> <s> may i ask whether owing to liverpools very difficult situation as an inner city he will now have some discussions <e> <s> liverpool has suffered very much indeed from loss of rate support grant to the extent of million since <e> <s> may i ask whether discussions will go on within the next few months to discover whether anything can be done to help that city <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make the point that i was hoping to make earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the minister having listed the number of things the government are doing will also state the amount of rate support grant that has been lost by inner cities in the last six years since the government took over <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for what he said and we are all delighted with what is going on may i ask for some information <e> <s> are there adequate numbers of craftsmen to do the work which we have seen going on above the throne here and indeed of stonemasons who must be repairing the stonework of the palace and other buildings <e> <s> is there an adequate supply and will the supply continue <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long debate but an interesting one characterised by strong and indeed passionate feelings and by the number of noble lords who have personal and expert knowledge of the south-west <e> <s> as at least a part-time resident of cornwall i have spent many hours in traffic jams between whitton down and okehampton and i am well aware of the desperate state of the cornish economy and the numbers of the unemployed <e> <s> no one doubts that a bypass for okehampton is absolutely essential or that its construction must be given high priority <e> <s> but what this debate is about is the size and the nature of the price to be paid for the needed action <e> <s> it is an argument of principle versus expediency as the noble lord lord hunt said some five hours ago <e>", "<cs> my lords liverpool has been a proud city and a great international port <e> <s> it has now become one of the most deprived communities in the land with the fifth worst unemployment rate of any authority and with appalling problems of overcrowding bad housing and population loss <e> <s> merseyside is the fifth most deprived region in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment <e> <s> mr kinnock denounced the liverpool militants at the labour party conference on nd october <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph of the circular to which the minister has just referred admits that there is a lack of parity between the way that council tenants and private tenants are treated <e> <s> therefore would it not be better if the environmental health officers had the right if council tenants made complaints to them to take them to the housing committee which is held in public so that tenants would know their grievances were really attended to and could not just be put aside on a shelf <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> the government congratulate themselves on the abolition of targets and penalties but we must remember that local authorities can still be penalised very heavily if they go over the grant related expenditure <e> <s> grant related expenditure was not intended for such a purpose <e> <s> its purpose was to provide a level of central government support to local services to compensate authorities for the differences in rateable resources and the need to spend and to influence not to control expenditure decisions of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the inner cities will be getting million more this year <e> <s> where will that he coming from and who will suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make myself clear as a result of what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said <e> <s> what i certainly meant to say was that it was for the elected members of local authorities to decide what to spend on the needs of their area <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very disappointing to have exactly the same answer that i had three months ago and more than six months after the education corporal punishment bill was withdrawn <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that only yesterday another corporal punishment case was declared admissible by the european commission of human rights the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for his very clear and able explanation of the report <e> <s> the subject of science and technology in local government assumes greater and greater importance and i am very glad that the select committee chose to investigate it <e> <s> like the noble lord lord tordoff i hope that this debate will help to obtain some publicity for the report <e> <s> it deals with many matters very important to the individual citizen health welfare and comfort environmental matters like noise air and water pollution and waste disposal <e> <s> the general public is not very aware of the scientific and technical functions statutorily performed by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the districts were not agreeing and were not taking on the services <e> <s> what will happen if by st april nothing has been arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene again <e> <s> my question was whether this was legal and i gave warning of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating this very important statement <e> <s> it is interesting that after seven years of conservative government there is no promise of legislation during this parliament although there was a commitment years ago and again in tory manifestoes to abolish domestic rates <e> <s> in a letter from the secretary of state to conservative councillors in january mr kenneth baker said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> it is a question that i asked previously to which i do not think the minister responded <e> <s> it concerns paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank very sincerely the noble lord lord seebohm for initiating the debate <e> <s> this is a very important and a very challenging inquiry <e> <s> after many years in which the subject seems to have been accorded very little or only casual notice this report has brought into sharp focus the lamentable state of housing in britain <e> <s> it has come out almost at the same time as the department of the environments inquiry into the condition of the local authority housing stock the royal institute of british architects <e>", "<cs> my lords to make clear that the noble lord understood what i said was an environment that the people should like <e> <s> i hope that he did get that clear <e> <s> that is what i wanted not only the general good environment but something the people liked <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that our policy is rather fluid in this matter at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> however it is a non-statement <e> <s> it tells us absolutely nothing which we did not know before from the newspapers <e> <s> i think that it understates the harm to education that has been caused by the dispute and of the loss of morale in the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness quite answered both my points about finances <e> <s> i think she answered about the monies for the settlement when i said i hoped there might be a generous gesture and i gather from what she said that there will not but i also asked about the government expenditure plans for <e> <s> surely if there had been agreement about salaries much earlier on in the year that percentage increase would have been allowed for in the plans for the following year <e> <s> i am asking can that now happen <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for his explanation of the bill <e> <s> but there our gratitude ends <e> <s> we do not like the bill nor do the association of county councils the association of metropolitan authorities the association of district councils the council of scottish local authorities or the national association of local councils representing over parishes and town councils <e> <s> rarely can there have been such unanimity in opposition to a piece of government legislation <e> <s> it is not surprising <e> <s> this is the twelfth local government bill that this government have introduced since not to mention four housing bills <e> <s> each has in some way taken away from the powers and freedom of local authorities to do as they think best for the people they serve <e> <s> these bills have generally been too hastily prepared and presented with as a result poor drafting as is all too evident in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads my speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down in the light of his connection with eton perhaps i may ask him whether there is anything in the way of political education at eton <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the noble lords connection with eton i asked whether there is anything in the way of political education at that college <e>", "<cs> my lords in my innocence i must say that i was really rather puzzled by the motion that the noble baroness put before us today <e> <s> it seemed a bit of a hotchpotch <e> <s> my puzzlement was made greater because the wording changed from time to time <e> <s> first it was more related to local authorities and their responsibilities and the noble lord lord elton was going to respond for the government <e> <s> that appeared on the order paper <e> <s> then it changed and became more an education debate with the noble earl lord swinton having the responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest that it was sinister <e> <s> it seemed a little odd because i knew for quite a considerable time i think quite as soon as the noble baronesss motion was on the order paper that the local government bill was coming on yesterday <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate on this amendment and i shall certainly not take up much of the committees time now <e> <s> the minister spent a great deal of time on the courts on what would happen in the courts and on what the judges would be able to do and the judgment of the local authorities about whether they would be taken to court or not <e> <s> my noble friend lord elystan-morgan answered the early comments from the noble lord lord broxbourne <e>", "<cs> what has emerged from this quite lengthy discussion is that there is still a good deal of dissatisfaction with the wording of that part of the clause <e> <s> however i am not absolutely wedded to my amendment so i should like to read very carefully what the minister and everyone who has spoken to the amendment have said and then decide what we do at the next stage <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have had a long discussion on clause and that is indicative of how difficult the government have found it to word the clause in a way that is acceptable to any party in this committee <e> <s> we are glad of course that the government have decided to look again at various problems that have arisen <e> <s> we are even more pleased that the committee has decided to accept the amendment that we put forward <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord suggesting that ilea can do these things out of its own resources or out of resources under section <e>", "<cs> i feel that i have been bombarded with words and i have been unable to take them in that fast <e> <s> therefore i shall certainly have to read what has been said before i consider what to do at the next stage <e> <s> however i should like to emphasise that of a number of authorities that the noble lord mentioned the ilea is the only directly elected authority for the whole of the london area <e> <s> it is therefore in a very special position in that respect <e>", "<cs> i should like just to ask the minister a question <e> <s> when he said he was considering some redrafting of clause was he referring just to parish councils or will he make it rather wider than that <e> <s> we certainly should not be satisfied with an amendment which dealt only with parish councils <e> <s> i very much support what the noble lord lord sandford said <e> <s> what he suggested would seem to be quite a possible amendment although i have not fully considered it <e> <s> again of course this is a matter of trust between local and central government and i think it would be a very nice gesture if the government in this case could decide to follow widdicombe and leave things as they are <e>", "<cs> we would object very strongly to this amendment <e> <s> it seems to give the secretary of state quite unnecessary almost unlimited power to control the publicity of local authorities <e> <s> i should think that if we want to make the situation between central and local government even worse this amendment would be guaranteed to do that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one comment <e> <s> we are not altogether happy about clause but we have expressed our reservations <e> <s> what we do about the <e>", "<cs> of course we on this side of the committee are pleased that this house has been brought into the whole affair <e> <s> having said that it is only a partial satisfaction because it is the convention of this place that we do not vote against orders regulations and so on and equally that we should not vote against a draft <e> <s> we have sometimes put an amendment to regulations but they have never altered the words of the regulation or order whatever it may be <e> <s> the example of rhodesia is true as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said but we think it was an affirmative not negative resolution <e>", "<cs> this order will be an affirmative order when it comes before the house <e> <s> however i should like to make it quite clear that the power of this house is very little indeed on these orders <e> <s> the power of the other place is not all that great <e> <s> it will not have the opportunity to amend the code of practice <e> <s> it can vote either for it or against it as i understand it and our power is really nil <e> <s> it is a courtesy which we are glad to have <e>", "<cs> i understand that <e> <s> we can if we notice that they are on the order paper but i understand affirmative resolutions have to be brought before the house <e>", "<cs> the government have all the time had considerable difficulty with this clause <e> <s> they have certainly faced difficulty today <e> <s> a draft code was produced but has had to be withdrawn <e> <s> we can however guess something of the governments intentions from that draft code <e> <s> we hope very much of course that the next one will be very different from the draft that has now gone <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that the code would be ready but that the government would be able to say that they had put in a clause that will demand a code of practice and that the local authority associations will have to have regard to it <e> <s> this is the reason it seems to me why the government were so adamant about not accepting the earlier amendments <e>", "<cs> i think that this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> it shows an awareness of the problems which local authorities are facing when they have to prepare for this bill becoming an act <e> <s> neither we nor the associations oppose the principle of local authorities being accountable for their actions <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for that reply and of course i was aware of the commitment to produce an amendment on report <e> <s> i should like to consult again with my colleagues in the education world but i feel that possibly some satisfactory solution could be arrived at <e> <s> hoping for that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that the minister misunderstood what i was saying <e> <s> certainly i was not attacking widdicombe <e> <s> i was attacking the governments use of widdicombe <e>", "<cs> i beleive that what i was saying was that the widdicombe committee was hurried into producing the interim report for the benefit of the government who then ignored a great deal of what was said in that interim report <e> <s> there have been a certain number of misunderstandings but i shall read what has been said by the minister <e> <s> i hope that he will also read what i have said and will then understand it <e>", "<cs> we too would like to support the idea behind the amendment <e> <s> there probably is in a great many cases some duty to provide a remedy but is this the right moment <e> <s> the select committee on the parliamentary commissioner for administration is currently considering the question of remedies for the complainant when a local authority has failed to provide appropriate redress and maladministration has been found against it <e> <s> it would seem sensible to await that report and so this is not quite the right moment to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the statement even if we look on it a trifle cynically <e> <s> i have a number of questions to ask <e> <s> have not a great many of the local authorities already fixed their precepts and rates <e> <s> there was a list of recommended and approved precepts published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one question to ask out of regrettable ignorance <e> <s> i believe that i am correct in thinking that local authorities cannot now raise a supplementary rate <e> <s> i understand that the minister agrees that some authorities have already fixed their rate <e> <s> if they are now to receive some form of benefit from this handout then can they raise i do not know what one might call it a reduced rate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords perhaps a supplementary rebate would be the correct phrase <e> <s> i will be very interested if the minister can tell me about that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel very humble having faced four noble and learned lords and all of them against me on amendment no <e> <s> to delete <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether that is the policy of the association of district councils of which he is president <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because the noble lord lord hayter has put the case for getting rid of clause with such skill that his comments need no elaboration <e> <s> as we might have expected the minister has made a very spirited defence of the governments position and has described his own amendment very clearly <e> <s> however although he quoted from and referred to various parts of the widdicombe report he was very selective <e> <s> whatever widdicombe may have said as to posing this or that possibility he concluded his report by saying that subsection should be deleted <e> <s> that is the position we want to hold on to <e> <s> so do the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the government are justifying amendment no <e> <s> on the grounds of present publicity for economic developments carried out under section so that restricting such publicity to the p account under section in the future will only replicate the existing situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am constantly surprised by the attitude that some noble lords opposite take about the attitudes of voluntary organisations and indeed of many ordinary people <e> <s> they seem to be seeing reds under the beds everywhere <e> <s> this seems to me to be really a very straightforward amendment which is not going to create any trouble or harm <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady faithfull said this really should be supported <e> <s> i am really amazed at some of the things i have heard today and i think i will stop there <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are all delighted to accept the amendment but we were reminded on an earlier occasion today that the drafting of this bill has been extremely careless <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very glad to see this amendment because i supported the noble lord lord elliott when he moved amendment no <e> <s> as it was in committee <e> <s> unfortunately he is not here <e> <s> at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very nice to have assurance doubly sure <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for that <e> <s> i shall of course read what he has said and pass it on to the people who are anxious but i hope that everything is now going to be well <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist a comment <e> <s> the minister said that he has to bring this forward now because of a technical defect in the act <e> <s> it just goes to show that that act was brought forward in a very great hurry and had not been carefully enough considered and there have been a lot of tidying-up operations ever since <e> <s> we hope that this will perhaps be the last of them <e> <s> this again forces a change in the long title of the bill <e> <s> however naturally we shall not have any objection to the amendment but i could not resist that comment <e>", "<cs> my lords the object of the amendment would seem to be a cheap effective and quick way of dealing with those who are transgressing the law <e> <s> cheapness is certainly not the hallmark of litigation which starts in the high court especially if it goes via the court of appeal to the house of lords <e> <s> at the end of the day the litigant could find himself heavily out of pocket <e> <s> if the litigation were to run the whole gamut of the hierarchy of the courts it would certainly not be quick <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to express my support for this amendment <e> <s> my name is set down to it <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord sandford put the case admirably <e> <s> he expressed the broader view of local government and the noble lord lord campbell the narrower view of what local authorities can do <e>", "<cs> my lords there were many reservations expressed from all sides of the house at second reading particularly about part ii of the bill <e> <s> it has been remarkable how many of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess that i was rather surprised by the choice of this motion for the conservative party debate because it seemed to be either critical of local government or critical of central government and i knew that the noble lord lord marshall was an extremely good local government man and also i am sure a good tory <e> <s> it just seemed a bit odd <e> <s> i have very much enjoyed listening to his responsible fair and factual speech and i think i could agree with him that something needs to be done to improve the financing of local government <e> <s> i may not agree with all the solutions of the green paper or indeed with all of his premises but i think that my comments will emerge in the course of my speech and so i shall move on to what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords just before the noble lord sits down i asked a further question about what would happen to the million that the glc is not allowed to spend but in the light of the time i should be happy if the noble lord would write to me about it <e>", "<cs> rot <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that sir hugh cubitt the director of the housing corporation in a report in july complained that programmes for housing for the most direly in need were desperately under-funded and surely it is up to the government to produce more funds for the housing corporation when it has been made quite clear in a great many reports how disastrous the housing situation is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether the government are giving any advice to british citizens about travelling to other parts of the middle east besides the lebanon and libya <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not absolutely clear that the state of houses is very bad indeed <e> <s> also i must say that i consider the ministers replies today to show an extreme complacency <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is no use trying to bamboozle the house about what money is spent on housing when expenditure on housing between and has gone down in real terms by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether there have been any responses made to the special development order that the house was told was being laid at the time when a statement was made on th february <e> <s> the requisite six weeks are now up and we wonder what those consultations and representations have brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the plan to build environmental impact assessment into the planning system which was announced i think by the minister of state this week will have any effect on the eventual choice of site <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> however i should like to make a slight protest about the time that the statement arrived <e> <s> it was delivered to this front bench at pm which is not quite good enough particularly when on hearing the statement we find that it does not tell us a great deal that we did not already know from the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting and well-informed debate <e> <s> it has also been a lively one <e> <s> i believe that the opposition was totally justified in devoting one it its debating days to this very important subject <e> <s> we had hoped that the white paper would be debated in government time but it was not <e> <s> perhaps it is not hard to see why <e>", "<cs> my lords that is unfair <e> <s> i said that there were some things in the green paper which were <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the london boroughs grants committee received a letter about the london hazards centre from the institution of environmental health officers drawing attention to the very valuable work that the centre does for the whole of london <e> <s> as the government were responsible for a great many voluntary organisations losing grant because of the abolition bill will they use their influence to try to give some support to this very valuable centre <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the position of the labour party on this matter <e> <s> the local government committee of the national executive committee of the labour party sent out an advice note to local authorities in february <e> <s> it was sent to all labour groups and affiliated trade unions and it said that keeping the papers from public libraries was undesirable censorship <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in a recent survey of public bodies only per cent <e> <s> of the members were women and of those chairing them only per cent <e> <s> were women <e> <s> does he not think that whoever compiles the list of the great and the good could have another go and try to get a few more women on it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform the house which government department is responsible for recommending counter-measures to a nuclear emergency such as the removal of cattle from contaminated pastures in cumbria which some people think should have been done some time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords housing is a human problem and a very big human problem and it is not going away <e> <s> it is getting bigger <e> <s> that fact and the information in the speeches this afternoon and in the numerous important reports that we have had over the past year totally justify our choosing the subject for debate <e> <s> those who suffer from poor housing or no housing at all need others to put their case as the right reverend prelate said <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are very grateful to the noble lord lord holderness for giving the house an opportunity to discuss the special development order <e> <s> i believe we would all agree that the situation is very difficult <e> <s> low level waste must be disposed of and it will continue to have to be disposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement which i may say is a very long complicated statement and difficult to digest thoroughly in the short space of time there has been since we were handed it <e> <s> it is superficially fairly attractive but i can see a number of snags masked by jargon <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just clear up one point <e> <s> the minister responded to my earlier remarks about the audit commission saying that there was considerable scope for savings of up to a billion <e> <s> in fact i referred to that in my remarks and i said that the joint groups of civil servants and officials who i think are an official group went into this and agreed efficiency savings of million and not billion <e> <s> it was the million that was taken into account in quantifying the billion gap so i think the billion has been a little discredited <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister urge his department to implement at once the widdicombe recommendation published in a report recently that the p limit on section should be raised because the boroughs in the area of the old glc and the districts in the area of the met counties are getting only half what they got under section <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for explaining this long bill to us <e> <s> and i have listened to the reasons he gave for its length <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for telling us that we shall have the amendments in fairly good time though i am a little daunted to hear that there will be so many of them <e> <s> even so it is a long bill <e> <s> there are clauses and schedules <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that <e> <s> it was not a claim that i made it was in fact a question i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for explaining this bill but cannot believe that he can have had very much pleasure or pride in doing so <e> <s> it is a shabby little bill and the government have been forced to bring it forward because of the shortcomings of the previous legislation <e> <s> the government have been caught out <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down has he anything to say about <e>", "<cs> it is of course satisfactory that the minister realises that the present position is very unsatisfactory <e> <s> if the government were intending to change things and to put down an amendment it is rather a pity that it was not put down for us at the committee stage so that we could see it <e> <s> it is very difficult to realise its full implications from what has been said <e> <s> our amendment has been down since the end of july so the government have had plenty of time to consider it <e>", "<cs> i think it will come as no surprise to the committee that we do not like this amendment <e> <s> we showed in the vote on the previous amendment that we have some suspicion about what the secretary of state might do and i think we are again suspicious on this amendment <e> <s> we do not want to put this power into his hands <e>", "<cs> we have wandered a little off amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are not talking about percentages we are talking about whether the secretary of state has the right to change them by order <e> <s> that is what we object to <e> <s> we object to giving the power to the secretary of state when we should have very little control over what happens <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank my noble friend lord houghton for his powerful speech and support <e> <s> i can only repeat to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that we are not against home ownership and we are not against people being able to buy when there is an adequate pool <e> <s> as he said even if a house is sold it is still a house but the stock of houses to rent is reduced and what more and more people need are houses and flats to rent <e> <s> we want flats to rent to remain particularly for the single the old and the young and those who wish to be mobile <e> <s> the noble lord lord coleraine asked why should not flats be sold at the same price as houses <e> <s> it is not the prices that we are discussing but the discounts <e> <s> we do not see why this bribe should be increased to the extent it is <e>", "<cs> i am not clear from what the noble baroness has said whether or no the money that the local authority is going to have to forward for these purposes is coming out of the housing investment programme moneys or not <e> <s> we did not have a clear answer to that <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a certain amount of confusion about where the money is to come from and the purpose of this <e> <s> as with the previous clause clause we need to look at this again because we are <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add to what has been said <e> <s> of course i agree with everything that my noble friends have said but i should like to raise one further query <e> <s> could the amendments which have been proposed even perhaps reduce tenants inadequate existing rights of consultation if their council is planning to dispose of their homes to the private sector <e> <s> i refer to tenants existing rights of consultation as established in the court of appeal judgment in the case of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the minister <e> <s> he quoted a paragraph <e> <s> i wonder whether he can say to which amendment and to which paragraph he refers <e>", "<cs> some authorities will welcome public sector bodies having the additional power to apply for certificates of fair rent before disposal <e> <s> it could provide some protection to tenants though it is insufficient protection where disposals occur <e> <s> rents are almost certain to rise because of this provision because local authority rents are generally lower than fair rents <e> <s> that will increase the cost to tenants and also to the exchequer as housing benefits will also increase <e> <s> who is this amendment intended to help <e>", "<cs> there certainly seems to be some dispute as to exactly what this is intended to provide <e> <s> at this stage of the evening i think it would be sensible to read what the minister has said and if we want to come back with further questions or amendments to this clause then we shall do that at report stage <e>", "<cs> we asked if the government would be good enough to give us a redraft of this clause as it would read with all these amendments in it as we really had it too late in the day <e> <s> however they would not agree to do that <e> <s> it is a complicated matter and we had it really rather too late to consider with all the other amendments pages of them <e> <s> i think it arrived last monday or tuesday when the house was not sitting <e> <s> we shall have to reserve our comments on this matter until we have had a chance to read what the minister has said and see what the clause looks like when it has had all these amendments put in it <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether or not we are going to be pleased about it but we will certainly reserve our right to come back if need be and put down amendments on report stage <e>", "<cs> i gather this is really an improvement on the wording of the clause as it now stands <e> <s> may i ask whether disponee and disponor are new words in legislation <e> <s> we do not seem to have come across them before <e>", "<cs> the minister has not answered my question <e> <s> is this really a re-writing of what is there <e> <s> it is trying to make what is already there better <e> <s> it is not changing anything <e>", "<cs> i am not at all satisfied with what the minister has said but i will have the good grace to read what he has said in <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced by what the minister said and i think we probably are comparing like with like though he says we are not <e> <s> i shall have to read what he said and come to my own conclusion as to whether or not i shall come back again later on these matters <e>", "<cs> i just wondered whether the minister was aware of an article in the october issue of <e>", "<cs> my lords

this side welcome anything that will help the gross problems of unemployment and dereliction that exist in the areas mentioned <e> <s> we also welcome anything that will help unemployment <e>", "<cs>

be rated under the provisions of section of the general rate act <e> <s> will he please consider that <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with the ministers reply because there has been delay over six years <e> <s> since local authorities housing associations and voluntary associations have been worried about this situation and have been trying to get the department and ministers to do something about it <e> <s> there has been stalling already and there is the prospect of another working party being set up <e> <s> when will we have another housing bill in which there can be legislation to cope with this problem <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason why england and wales should not be taken on the same basis as scotland because even if there are fewer rented properties in england and wales than there are in scotland it depends on the tenants themselves and on the local authority whether they choose to go in for this process <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not satisfied with the ministers answer and i shall divide the committee <e>", "<cs> the minister said that he himself under the proposed clause could get on the waiting list <e> <s> i take it that he meant as an owner-occupier <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may return to the point i made some minutes ago about owner-occupiers <e> <s> i was wondering about the reason why the minister said he could get on to a list <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord is aware of his own departments report on the allocation of council housing which noted that a blanket prohibition on either the registration or consideration of owner-occupiers is difficult to justify since it may exclude many with very genuine housing problems <e>", "<cs> the noble lord would be very low down the list <e>", "<cs> may i ask one question in relation to the debate we had on amendment no <e> <s> last tuesday <e> <s> the minister said then in col <e>", "<cs> but what would be the other rights the minister thinks they would be keeping also <e>", "<cs> we have had quite a long debate on this amendment and it is a matter of very great importance <e> <s> before i wind up the discussion i want to tell the committee what i have heard from a number of tenants associations and perhaps i may read out a letter from the tower hamlets federation of tenants <e> <s> i may say that it was written after the new clauses had been published <e> <s> the letter says <e>", "<cs> i cannot immediately answer the noble lord but my noble friend would like to say something on this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has after all plenty of civil servants <e>", "<cs> the circumstances are very different <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply which had some crumbs of comfort in it <e> <s> i am surprised by what he says about their having had no evidence <e> <s> i shall make inquiries about that because i was told specifically that shelter had provided evidence <e> <s> i shall certainly make investigations about that <e>", "<cs> that is what my note says <e>", "<cs> i too should like that assurance from the minister because it is very important from the tenants point of view <e>", "<cs> i think there is still some anxiety about whether this is entirely satisfactory <e> <s> we shall read what the minister has said and if we are still anxious after that we reserve the right to come back at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> so far as i can see and so far as i can understand from what has been said this is an amendment to be welcomed in that there will be grants for doing things for which there could not previously be grants in the general and common parts of buildings <e> <s> so far as i have understood the amendments we give them a welcome <e>", "<cs> may i ask what happened after schedule to the governments clause on shared ownership <e> <s> i think it is reprinted as amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i am in some confusion about the order <e> <s> it will be helpful if the government can tell us <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation but it is extremely confusing for the committee to have the numbers of the amendments printed in the first marshalled list switched about <e> <s> it is difficult to know where we are <e> <s> i am sorry if there is confusion but i do not think that it is the fault of the opposition <e>", "<cs> may we know what we are going to do <e> <s> are we dealing next with amendment no <e> <s> after clause <e>", "<cs> these are probably quite important amendments <e> <s> if i may be quite clear that i have understood properly what the noble lord said it seems to me that the provision of homes for shared ownership has been restricted to councils and registered housing associations and the governments aim in this amendment is to widen shared ownership by allowing housing associations to provide homes under such schemes free of rent control and using private finance from building societies or perhaps from anywhere else <e>", "<cs> i think that reformed was the suggestion of the labour party <e>", "<cs> from what has been said it is clear that we are not at all happy about this new clause <e> <s>

are handed over to some other person or housing association the debt may well be written off <e> <s> that seems to be incredibly unfair <e>", "<cs> i think that that depends a little on the sums does it not <e> <s> this has been an extremely useful discussion and it has clarified a certain number of matters <e> <s> i believe the minister said that next week he was seeing people from the new towns <e> <s> therefore that meeting will have taken place by the time we come to the report stage of this bill <e> <s> we hope that information will reach us well before the date of the report stage so that if we need to put down amendments to the new clause which the minister has moved we shall be able to do so <e> <s> i believe that much thought will have to take place between now and then as well as much consultation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this was one of the amendments that was put down rather late <e> <s> we shall have to read what the minister has said <e>

year <e> <s> i shall read what <e>", "<cs> it was dealt with last tuesday <e>", "<cs> at second reading there was a great deal of discussion about enterprise zones and their similarity to simplified planning zones and i know there are fiscal benefits with enterprise zones which do not happen with spzs <e> <s> however i think it is of interest that research commissioned by the department of the environment into the effects of enterprise zones has shown that a reduction in detailed planning control has not been a significant factor in attracting development to enterprise zones <e> <s> recently both the national audit office and the house of commons public accounts committee have further questioned the value for money of enterprise zones and pointed to adverse effects on other areas <e> <s> that can apply equally to simplified planning zones <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the minister one sees at the beginning of clause the words <e>", "<cs> i take it that the minister is in sympathy with the aim behind the amendment <e> <s> the amendment does not mention loan or share capital <e> <s> it was perhaps my mention of venture capital that upset the minister <e>", "<cs> may i ask two questions which i asked at second reading <e> <s> i do not believe that they were answered <e> <s> first will the money for this urban regeneration grant be in addition to the existing urban development grant <e> <s> my second question is this <e> <s> will the grants be used in areas of deprivation and dereliction which are not in inner cities <e>", "<cs> in addition <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the minister said <e> <s> if i find that i am still not satisfied i shall have to come back at the next stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether he knows when we shall receive the printed version ready for report stage because the time is not all that long <e> <s> where there are a substantial number of amendments to a clause it will read totally differently from its present form <e> <s> if we do not have the printed version quickly perhaps we may have a draft of the clauses that have been substantially altered before the printed version comes out <e>", "<cs> i wish to take the opportunity to say something about amendment no <e> <s> which has not had the discussion that amendment no <e> <s> has had <e> <s> if i do not speak now i shall lose the opportunity because these amendments are being spoken to together <e>", "<cs> in the absence of my noble friend lady birk i should like to support the noble lord lord kennet in the amendment <e> <s> it seems a very strange anomaly that in the church of england should have this particular privilege <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to ask the minister i have given him notice of this question what is the governments attitude to the ecclesiastical exemption under section <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> it does seem a bit odd that the minister says that going in to do repairs is excessive interference with private property rights when there is in fact the right of compulsory purchase <e> <s> if listed buildings are not to be kept in repair what is the purpose of listing them in the first place and then prosecuting for bulldozing such buildings without consent <e> <s> it seems to me that the arguments are not very strong but at this time of night i do not think that i can go through all the ministers objections <e> <s> shall read them with care and come back if need be at the next stage which is going to need a good many days i should think considering the number of things to which we will have to come back <e>", "<cs> we shall have to see whether what happens is as good as the intentions apparently are <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> a is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> it would seem sensible that i should now speak briefly to the amendment in my name <e>", "<cs> we were of course expecting this after the statement last week but i shall have to speak on this amendment for a minute or two even though it is so late <e> <s> if we go back to the passing of the local government planning and land act we find some interesting history <e> <s> initially the government intended that the power for the secretary of state to designate areas for udcs should be open-ended subject to parliamentary approval <e> <s> however members of the opposition in another place hinted at the possibility of designations being made in suburban <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return the compliment and congratulate the minister on his stamina because he really has dealt with nearly the whole matter with a little help from the noble baroness <e> <s> this committee stage has been a very heavy burden and i congratulate the minister for still being on his feet <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a thoroughly unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> really the ministers response shows a total misunderstanding of the housing situation <e> <s> we are not asking for a one-for-one replacement <e> <s> the amendment asks for a minimum reimbursement of per cent <e> <s> and a maximum of per cent <e> <s> of the difference <e> <s> if the government want to go on and have all council houses sold that will be the end of council housing <e> <s> the point is that the waiting lists are growing and there are no houses to put these people into <e> <s> as my noble friend lord pitt said more and more people are having to go into bed and breakfast accommodation at a most enormous cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for recognising that there can be problems for authorities which have had to let these houses on what they hope will be a temporary basis and it is quite clear that the wording of my amendment is far from satisfactory <e> <s> i think that the best we can do is to take it away and hope that we can get the wording better and with the sympathy that has been expressed for it bring it back at the next stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am altogether satisfied with the answer though there are one or two points the minister has made which i should like to read about and think about before deciding whether or not this is the end of this matter <e> <s> for the moment i should like to reflect and i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a curious answer <e> <s> i think the anxieties which have been expressed on all these amendments which we have considered recently show that we are still not happy about the arrangements proposed and we are worried about the rights of the minority <e> <s> that is where a public inquiry would satisfy everyone <e> <s> however the minister did i understand give some sort of undertaking to my noble friend lord elystan-morgan and since he has given some undertaking i think it would be only right to withdraw this amendment and examine what has been said in order that we may come back on third reading <e> <s> we are still not happy about this situation <e> <s> i should like to add one point <e> <s> the minister said that tenants would not lose their homes as a result of a disposal to a private landlord <e> <s> this can happen and has in fact happened <e> <s> i think he was wrong about that <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not altogether satisfied but i am interested <e> <s> the next thing i shall have to do is write to the editors of the big <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to see why if these houses are going to be of a decent standard as the minister says he cannot accept our amendment that they should have a certificate of good repair <e> <s> that seems very strange <e> <s> however i shall read the ministers reassurances and again if necessary i shall come back on third reading <e> <s> however for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before he sits down may i just ask the minister this question <e> <s> if a landlord because of unacceptable practice has ceased to be an approved body surely he is not then a fit person to be the landlord of an assured tenancy property is he <e>", "<cs> well my lords i shall have another think about it <e> <s> in the meantime i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we do not my lords <e> <s> we have had a lot of support for this amendment <e> <s> it is not trying to do anything really new it is trying to restore the situation to what it was before lord brightmans judgment <e> <s> that is all we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may have a copy of the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see why a labour government not having taken some action in a period of years when they could have done so prevents this government from taking action now when these figures are clearly ridiculously out of date <e> <s> will the government be prepared to look at this again in the light of what i have said and after they have had time to read and study it because i do not think that really all that much attention was being paid just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that repeal is perhaps a possibility <e> <s> i should like to think about that but of course i shall read very carefully what the minister has said and try to direct my mind very positively to it at a better time of day <e> <s> with the assurances he has given me that he will look at this matter again i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister said there had been no evidence that authorities had under this ground got rid of tenants for other purposes <e> <s> i have quoted the spencer beck estate and the waterlow estate in bethnal green so in fact it can be used for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to it with amendment no <e> <s> so what i should have done when it was called if it had been in my name was not move it <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems ridiculous to accept an amendment on report in another place to insert <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lady nicol i should like to welcome these amendments very much indeed <e> <s> my noble friend moved amendments at the committee stage about the opencast coal clause and i know that she will be very relieved that this amendment has been put forward by the government <e> <s> i should like to express our gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that reply because i thought we had gone a long way to meet the objections made in committee <e> <s> the only conclusion one can draw is that ministers are happy to see some of the occupied listed buildings deteriorating as inevitably they must if some action is not taken <e> <s> at this late stage of the day i shall say merely that i shall read what the minister said and decide whether to come back on third reading with yet again an amended version of the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also say that we are very pleased to see this amendment introduced in the bill <e> <s> i think it is excellent and i congratulate the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord said that in his view the building would be very suitable for an hotel <e> <s> do we understand that that is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for reconsidering the matter <e> <s> i think he does me an injustice <e> <s> i know what is in the schedule <e> <s> we have been living solidly with this bill for three weeks now and i have read the schedule a good many times <e> <s> i still find myself dissatisfied with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> reading the next few lines in his letter he says <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has made some observations about a later amendment one to which my name and that of the noble baroness lady faithfull has been put i think i should say that we have a special purpose in putting forward this later amendment and that it will become quite clear why we have put in a provision similar to paragraph in our schedule <e> <s> but i should like to point out to him that the first words are different <e> <s> they say <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course very glad to have had the principle of any amendment accepted by the government and we shall not complain at the small changes which have been made from the original amendment that we proposed <e> <s> we welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> we have waited and waited <e> <s> the opportunity is here now for us to put the situation right and to what everybody thought it was before that judgment so i should like to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is putting words into my mouth <e> <s> i did not say that we wished all the houses to go to the districts <e> <s> we want some of them to be able to go to the districts <e> <s> i must emphasise that the waiting lists at the towns involved are quite considerable over at basildon nearly at crawley over at milton keynes at peterborough at warrington and nearly at wrekin which concerns telford new town <e> <s> so these districts are already having difficulty in housing the people in their areas who need housing and this is what we are anxious about <e> <s> we do not mind at all some houses going to housing associations <e> <s> we are perhaps worried about their going to private persons and the new clause clause says any person <e> <s> that is what lies behind the worries of the noble baroness and myself <e> <s> the minister has given some assurances about the consultations which will take place but may i take it from him that tenants will be consulted before he comes to any decision <e> <s> can he answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the assurances that the minister has given and in view of what he told both the noble baroness and the deputation from the new towns that he saw that their views will be taken into account before anything very drastic happens i am prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope that what we have said about the need for these districts to have a proper housing stock will be kept very fully in mind by the minister whose responsibility it is to deal with the new towns now so it will be up to him to make sure that these promises and expectations are lived up to <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem that my third try has been no more successful than my earlier efforts in committee and on report <e> <s> however i rather resent the way in which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter jumped on one comment that i made and really concentrated on it which i thought was unfair <e> <s> i think that almost anyone would agree that the south-east part of england is rather more prosperous than other areas of the country and house prices would perhaps bear that out <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not think that i needed to spell it out but i shall not pursue it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are about to pass a bill which is very different from the one which was brought from the commons on st may <e> <s> no fewer than new clauses have been added the seventeenth having been added this afternoon as well as two new schedules <e> <s> in addition there have been substantial amendments to very many clauses and schedules <e> <s> we had amendments to discuss at committee stage- per cent <e> <s> of them from the government at report stage and today <e> <s> the result has been a very hard three weeks for all concerned with the bill i include the staff of the public bill office without the proper interval of two weekends between committee and report stage and without the usual three sitting days between report stage and third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i quoted that when i spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank all those who have spoken in my support <e> <s> they were very effective speeches more effective than i could make myself <e> <s> from those who are opposed to my point of view there has come a distrust of local authorities which i am very sorry to hear <e> <s> it seemed to me very odd that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spoke of the local authority being judge and jury in its own case when it came to the right to buy of the elderly if our amendment is carried because the landlord the local authority already makes the decision in all general cases such as in sheltered housing disabled housing and grouped housing for the mentally ill for all those the challenge is in the court <e> <s> we are asking for the elderly to be treated in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us whether there has been any discussion with the irish <e> <s> i understand that the pollution in the west of wales and west scotland is said to be because of emissions from irish power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government provide any incentive by way of grants or subsidies to help people who are building their houses or those who already have houses without insulation so that they can instal this very necessary item <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as a result of all these questions this is a very much more complicated matter than appears at first sight <e> <s> occasionally there may be inadequate management but very often there is good management and there are still substantial arrears and a great many factors go to make them up <e> <s> is the minister also satisfied with the way in which the figures are collected <e> <s> in the press notice issued by his department on th december the rent arrears as a percentage of rent collectable for brent was given as per cent <e> <s> the cipfa figure for brent was per cent <e> <s> they are admirable figures but we must remember that until may brent was a conservative-controlled authority <e> <s> will the minister look at the way in which these figures are put together and say whether they include rate as well as rent arrears <e> <s> that will make a great deal of difference to the eventual answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that a local authoritys response will depend very much on the questions asked by the department and on how it forms those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend but i cannot think that it has given either of them very much satisfaction to make as it shows up the political ineptitude of a succession of secretaries of state <e> <s> this is the fourth statement on rate support grant in five months and it shows the shambles that ministers have caused for local government <e> <s> one can only feel sympathy for the officers and the members of local authorities when they are trying to prepare their budgets for next year <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord fitt has said that he speaks from a personal point of view <e> <s> this is a private members bill and we are all speaking from a personal point of view <e> <s> i must make <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord ponsonby i should like to add my good wishes to members on every side of the house and in every quarter and wish them a very happy christmas and a happy and i suppose i must say prosperous new year <e> <s> perhaps i should have some reservations about that <e> <s> i heartily endorse everything that has been said about every member of the staff of the house in every part and there are a great many parts and wish them too a very happy christmas and new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the secretary of states statement the fourth statement that he has made on rate support grant since the begining of last autumn and now <e> <s> it is only because of the governments incompetence and ineptitude that this rate support grant statement is arriving in january which is so late and that the statement cannot be given effect to until the present local government finance bill becomes an act <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the minister for a moment <e> <s> is it not the case that it was not only changes of information that came in but that there was a slight switch to make his friends in the conservative authorities slightly happier <e>", "<cs> my lords may i correct something that the minister said when he was responding to what i had said <e> <s> he said that i suggested that more than half of the billion extra would go to the treasury <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> i said that almost half might and i was using a paper which was produced by brian tanner the principal negotiator for english rate support grant for local authorities in which he said <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister agrees that this has dragged on far too long and far too much limestone has been quarried in that time will he instruct his department to impose an output limitation of tonnes a year which was the figure given in the decision letter by the department in may last year so that at any rate there is some control at the moment until the agreement is signed by both parties <e>", "<cs> my lords when will the results of the inquiry into eldon hill quarry be announced <e> <s> that inquiry finished in march last year and i think the house would be reassured to know that there will not be the delay in announcements about that that there has

right to report on them as well as on local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been waiting for over a year for the opportunity to debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will they actually have all that to

remain to be renotified under the act <e> <s> if so is it a lack of funds on the part of the ncc that is preventing this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am very pleased that he said

said <e> <s> i am glad that he accepts there is some sense in the amendment <e> <s> i listened to what he said and with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must at once say how much i agree with what the minister has said <e> <s> we want people to use their votes <e> <s> i must of course congratulate the noble baroness on her fluency which is extreme <e> <s> the noble baroness attacked councils as being anti-democratic <e> <s> however i must confess that i found her speech anti-democratic because if these councils are doing things which are so bad and so unpopular then it is up to the electors to use their votes and to find people they prefer <e> <s> in this i agree with the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i must accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> however i still think that it is odd that the metropolitan police premises are four and a half times as costly as those in other parts of the country and that expenditure on civilian

near future to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has not read everything that my right honourable friend mr kinnock has said and if he reads the end part of my speech this afternoon he will see that i was very anxious to have co-operation between central and local government that i was dismayed by the way things were going that i was not happy with some labour councils and that i hoped that there might be some substantial changes and that these changes were already happening <e> <s> i am quite sure that my noble friend lord underhill will follow up these points when he replies but i think that the noble lord is being a little unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i believe that the

councils if they are being so iniquitous <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> it is up to them to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her very speedy explanation of the bill <e> <s> it was certainly a race through all the clauses <e> <s> this is the th local government bill that this government have brought to the house and the sixth which deals specifically with rate support grant and yet another is on its way <e> <s> the rate support grants bill had its second reading in another place just last wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me i did not say she was one of the speakers <e> <s> i think i said there were many tory peers speaking last week and this week there is only one back bencher <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> the bill he speaks of will be the third government bill on local government to be going through parliament since january in fact the third bill to be started in the past five weeks <e> <s> the bill mentioned in the statement was forecast in the queens speech in the terms <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> the honourable gentleman said that it was in a soon to be published bill <e> <s> one therefore expected that it was drafted <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanations <e> <s> as i said this is a probing amendment because there is still a great deal of uncertainty about exactly what is meant <e> <s> it is a complicated subject and i should certainly like to read what he has said <e>", "<cs> clause defines relevant and total expenditure in clause and respectively and as such it is one of the clauses which should broadly be necessary in a bill designed merely to correct the law <e> <s> the other clauses are clauses and for england and wales and clauses and for scotland <e> <s> very much more limited legal immunities would be required than those contained in clauses and <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for having had the kindness to send me letters about the amendments which were put down <e> <s> that was extremely helpful but i have to comment about the number of government amendments including several lengthy amendments to schedule <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support <e> <s> we have already expressed our anxiety about the blank cheque which is being given to the government by this subsection <e> <s> this is another effort by a different method from that of my noble friends to try to get this changed <e> <s> i should like to support the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> he has it wrong if he thinks we were pouring scorn on what he was saying <e> <s> it is a surprise and a pleasure when there is an offer of co-operation and another look at something <e>", "<cs> i was lucky enough to meet the minister after lunch before we came into the chamber and he warned me that this would be his reaction to the amendment <e> <s> i had time to look up clause <e> <s> my understanding of the clause is that it prevents this bill from increasing grant payable under other legislation such as the local government planning and land act <e> <s> the last words of clause say <e>", "<cs> we have moved perhaps a little further as we have debated this point <e> <s> the minister said twice i think that he was talking from the top of his head <e> <s> therefore i hope he will make inquiries to be absolutely certain that he is correct in what he said <e> <s> of course we shall also take advice on exactly what clause means and whether it is possible to amend it and therefore make amendment no <e> <s> possible <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister for that handsome apology and for having cleared up the point <e> <s> it is extremely helpful <e> <s> in the light of what he said we shall reconsider what to do at report stage knowing what the facts are <e> <s> i thank him <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one word in support of this amendment which is in the names of my noble friend lady fisher of rednal and myself <e> <s> this amendment deals with one aspect of the bill which goes well beyond putting the legal basis of rate support grant on a sound footing <e> <s> i hope that the minister realised the strength of feeling particularly in birmingham although the amendment also refers to other authorities <e> <s> there is very great deprivation in birmingham <e> <s> if this amendment is not accepted by the government birmingham will lose millions of pounds of grant and there will be a great deal of deprivation for the people of that city and the ratepayers will suffer as a result <e>", "<cs> we have had a good discussion on this clause but i cannot let it pass without making one comment <e> <s> the authorities we have been talking about i think my noble friend lord underhill read out which they were will as a consequence of the rate support grant order soon to be laid before the other place receive less block grant than their entitlement <e> <s> in the case of birmingham that amounts to millions of pounds of income that will have to be found from the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> we have had quite an interesting discussion on the amendment <e> <s> we shall have to read the debate with great care <e> <s> it seems to me that we were wise to bring these amendments forward <e> <s> they may well be necessary <e> <s> however in fairness to the noble baroness we must read <e>", "<cs> the minister has made a good effort because i made a long speech and i asked a lot of questions <e> <s> he has answered some but not all of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords remarks <e> <s> from what he has said i believe that he has been impressed by the very powerful opposition that there has been to certain parts of clauses and of this bill <e> <s> there was very distinguished opposition when my noble and learned friend lord silkin moved his amendment no <e> <s> and i am very glad that the noble lord is taking that into account <e> <s> there are a great many people who are very unhappy about many parts of this bill <e> <s> having had so many mistakes about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly thank the minister for that reply which is very good news <e> <s> it is odd how answers to letters seem to go out on the day that questions are put down <e> <s> why are there usually such long delays in issuing the results of public inquiries particularly about limestone quarries where a great deal of damage can be done while the results are being awaited <e> <s> it is a year since the inquiry on this quarry was finished <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister has not seen the point of these amendments <e> <s> he upbraided me for not having mentioned rate-capping <e> <s> i was saving the committees time by sticking to the matter in hand <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the amendments will make everything happen very much later <e> <s> i gave a practical timetable which would not take long <e> <s> it could all be done in a matter of two or three weeks <e> <s> authorities would much rather have uncertainty for that length of time if they knew that at the end they would receive fairer treatment <e> <s> do i understand that the rate supplementary report may not be in time for local authorities to study it before they have to make their rate on st march <e>", "<cs> we know the timetable fairly well <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill gave an example of the unfairness that would be caused to local authorities by the timetable to which they will have to work and the lack of notice about the representations that they made <e> <s> in some cases as the noble lord lord kilmarnock said they made no representations because they hoped to have the opportunity later <e> <s> it is unfair to a large number of authorities and to the people for whom they provide services <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may remind the noble lord of when this bill was introduced <e>", "<cs> it was published on th december which was the day when both houses i think were going into recess <e> <s> there was then the christmas holiday and the second reading of the bill was not until th january <e> <s> it was rushed through another place there was no report stage and it was guillotined at the committee stage <e> <s> it has not been published for all that long <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> as we have the report stage of this bill coming next week rather quickly after its committee stage will he be good enough to let my noble and learned friend and me know as soon as possible the outcome of the ministers visit to newham on friday <e> <s> that will be helpful to us when we consider what amendments to put down on report <e>", "<cs> i said nothing when we came to the end of clause and the question whether clause stand part because i thought that was so closely linked with schedule that it was better to make my comments now <e> <s> i am very dissatisfied with what we have heard both on clause and on schedule <e> <s> possibly because the minister has never been a local councillor his understanding and response to some of todays amendments and to the discussion has not been satisfactory he has not been as understanding as he normally is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say one word in response to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> it is not so much the formulae to which we object <e> <s> in fact our amendments kept the formulae <e> <s> it is the fact that there was no consultation with the local authorities before they were presented and there has been no opportunity to discuss them since <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments <e> <s> my purpose is not to challenge the need for some provision for supplementary precepts but to draw attention first to the potential penalty on local authorities implicit in the clause and secondly to the difficulties caused to local authorities by the lateness of the governments timetable which has occasioned the need for the clause <e>", "<cs> we are concerned about the people for whom local authorities are providing services <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the minister has said and consider whether i shall take up the matter again <e> <s> at the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i said yesterday that i was grateful to the minister for writing about the amendments which the government were about to put down <e> <s> again i cannot help commenting that there are a great many of them <e> <s> it is not really very competent legislation to have to produce such a vast number of lengthy amendments at this stage when the bill is going through the upper house <e> <s> it has already had time in the other house <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall respond to what the minister has so kindly said about the good humour with which this committee stage has been conducted and the speed with which we have got through it which is rather greater than i expected <e> <s> our thanks from this side to the minister and to the noble baroness and i hope we shall have a satisfactory report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply from the minister and of course i shall withdraw my amendment in the light of it <e> <s> naturally we shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i am still not quite sure that the minister has fully understood the purpose of the amendment that parliament should be informed of what is going on when this very extraordinary power in clause and clause has been used <e> <s> however i shall read carefully what he has said again and reserve the right to come back yet again at third reading if i feel that he has misunderstood me or that i have misunderstood him <e> <s> at the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all convinced by the ministers answer <e> <s> it seems that i must bring positive evidence before the house and i do not have that evidence with me at the moment <e> <s> however i am absolutely convinced that expenditure has been caused to local authorities and i hope to come back at third reading with positive evidence to show that that has happened <e> <s> in the meantime without that evidence i am forced to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is an unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> the or so authorities concerned would not be so upset and agitated about the bill if they were not going to be adversely affected by the lack of the usual processes that they could go through under the rates act <e> <s> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the minister on trying to make something of what is a very bad case indeed <e> <s> nobody could possibly say that what has been going on in local government between local government and central government has been anything but unhelpful messy and uncertain <e> <s> i shall not divide the house on this amendment at this time of night but i shall get fuller information from authorities as the statement has been made only today as to what will happen as a result of what has occurred today and what will happen if the appeal is not granted when the court is the minister listening <e>", "<cs> good <e> <s> on the previous amendment the noble lord said that i was trying to change the grant to the authorities that had been rate limited <e> <s> it is one thing to ask to have some more and to get it but it is quite another not to know where you will be for the next year <e> <s> that is the position into which the department has put local authorities <e> <s> as i said i shall get more information but i think we shall certainly be back with this amendment at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very glad to support the noble lord <e> <s> i said in committee that i thought he had a very good point and he seems to have coped with it well in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make just a brief comment <e> <s> naturally i am extremely pleased that the minister has been able to give us better news about newham but that seems to me to give some justification for the amendment which i moved earlier amendment no <e> <s> which aimed to show that there was unfairness in the way rate-capped and rate-limited authorities were treated <e> <s> the fact that there has been a change in regard to two authorities is very good but i think it demonstrates that i had quite a good case when i showed that in the interests of natural justice they all should have had a chance to have their circumstances looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not want to oppose the amendments but i gather that the require-ment for them comes from an oversight in the department which was spotted by the association of district councils <e> <s> what was believed to be common practice for and proved not to be so <e> <s> while accepting that all we can say is that we hope there will not be further examples of oversights in the department and that further tidying up amendments will not be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that with the deadline that was put on certain schemes on th february a great number of authorities are being prevented from providing houses that they would otherwise provide <e> <s> in one northern authority the numbers are houses and sheltered units and in outer and inner london boroughs the number of houses amounts at a conservative estimate to over <e> <s> as the scheme seems to be combining private sector and public sector finance can the noble lord persuade his department that there is a great loss of housing because of this very authoritative <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the sheffield scheme which was mentioned at the time of the statement on th february is entirely safe as i understood it was at the time <e> <s> however since that time there have apparently been some problems <e>", "<cs> my lords everything the minister has said has made me feel that we were rightly suspicious about these subsections in the bill all the time <e> <s> i am very glad of the support i have had from noble and learned lords and also from the noble lord lord kilmarnock whose name indeed appears on the amendment <e> <s> we are not satisfied with the ministers reply nor with the brave words of his supporters on the government benches <e> <s> i think we must test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to make just one comment about these amendments as they affect newham and gateshead <e> <s> i am absolutely delighted that the government have listened to the pleas of my noble and learned friend and that there has been a change in the formula which affects newham and gateshead <e> <s> however the house ought to be fully aware of the fact that the amendments put forward by the government do not mean that they are presenting more money to newham <e> <s> in fact newham will lose grant as a result of these amendments <e> <s> what will happen is that these authorities will be entitled to ask for more money from their ratepayers <e> <s> they will have more to spend but the extra will be coming from the ratepayers and not from the government <e> <s> before too big a thank you is given to the government it is important that we should all be aware of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think the minister does protest too much <e> <s> i am glad that he now admits that there have been difficulties and inconveniences to the local authorities <e> <s> there have been various statements on th january rd february and then on th march <e> <s> there have been constant changes and although the blame may not be entirely on one side it very seldom is in these cases it is local government which has suffered because of the actions of central <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton has me puzzled here <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot answer his point <e> <s> i have no adviser sitting in a box who can give me the information i need <e> <s> i am afraid i shall have to write to the noble lord later and explain this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene the reason that this amendment could not be brought before was that it arose out of the statement made by the secretary of state on th march which was the day we had the report stage <e> <s> so this is absolutely the first opportunity to bring in an amendment which would deal with that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me to intervene surely it would be possible to say for the benefit of the authorities which want to know what their position is when their rate really must be fixed by the end of march that whatever the result of the case this year there will be no change <e> <s> that is really what we want to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saying that if the amendments were technically wrong then the technicalities could be put right <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the substance should be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the minister has understood fully the complications which will ensue for some authorities as a result of the statement made by the secretary of state on thursday th march <e> <s> there will be great uncertainty and the amendments attempted to remove that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all agreed that it was essential to have a bill to clarify the law in relation to the meaning of total and relevant expenditure so that local authorities accounting could continue in the way it had been doing over the past six years since the act was passed <e> <s> what the opposition has objected to is that in this bill the government have gone much further than that and in their anxiety not to have further litigation and legislation they have created the most enormous umbrella to put up over the head of the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his explanation of the bill and of grant recycling clawback flowback close-ending and so on <e> <s> we are becoming familiar with those terms after the last week or so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it was the previous secretary of state mr kenneth baker who praised grant recycling highly about a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the european commission is instituting proceedings against the government under article of the treaty of rome because we have not met the standards of the drinking water directive <e> <s> would it not be a very suitable gesture in the european year of the environment for them to agree to meet the drinking water directive <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that water quality is of prime importance when considering conservation on the broads <e> <s> is he aware that the european commission is instituting proceedings against the government under article of the treaty of rome because we have not met the standards of the water directive <e> <s> would it not be a suitable gesture in the european year of the environment if the government agreed to meet that directive <e> <s> can i remind the minister that i asked him part of this question last week and he did not answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very glad that the noble lord lord ezra has asked this question tonight <e> <s> i suppose it would have been even more apt last week which was national housing week but we cannot always put unstarred questions when we want to <e> <s> it is also very suitable that the noble lord should be asking this question since he is president of the national home improvement council whose interesting report i received last monday <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer and note what he says about derogations <e> <s> do her majestys government accept that the words maximum admissible concentration in the council of the european communitys directive relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption mean maximum <e> <s> is the governments current policy of interpreting maximum admissible concentration as a three-month rolling average thus a breach of the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform us where and when the meeting with the civil servants of the department of the environment and civil servants from other member states to discuss the commissions proposals to deal with nitrate pollution is to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lady ewart-biggs on asking this unstarred question at what seems to be an apt time because it is just over a year since the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan councils <e> <s> it is also just over a year since an excellent debate on the voluntary organisations initiated by my noble friend lord bottomley on th march last year which has been mentioned by the noble baroness lady darcy and in which she spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> then it is going to be good news <e>", "<cs> my lords the second time <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me two-thirds of the boroughs have to agree <e> <s> the same difficulty as there was this year is very likely to go on with the same uncertainty and doubt until very near the beginning of the new financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her explanation of the orders <e> <s> i have one or two questions to ask her <e> <s> i was slightly surprised to hear that the corporation members had already been settled because one of the questions i was going to ask was whether the local authorities were to be well represented <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the problems of deferred purchase which of course is what is being referred to are not confined to labour authorities <e> <s> i have here a list of authorities which went into deferred purchase arrangements between and and a great many of them are conservative councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her explanation of the bill <e> <s> it is a very different bill from the one that was proposed very much earlier in the year when all sorts of privatisation measures contract compliance and so on were intended <e> <s> it is also a very different bill from the one that was introduced in february <e> <s> i think that it is the forty-third piece of local government legislation in the last eight years and the third this year <e> <s> but we are agreed that there has been a fairly satisfactory compromise reached <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there have been a number of reports over the past few years and that it would appear that none of them recommends privatisation so far as we can make out <e> <s> the employees are anxious to know what is going to happen <e> <s> industrial relations will not be very good in the light of this constant anxiety and doubt as to what the future will be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that

"<cs> my lords the problem of inner city decline has been with us for a long time <e> <s> politicians and planners were made to focus on it when peter shore produced his white paper <e>", "<cs> my

adequate by hmi is extremely important <e> <s> whatever the noble lord lord annan says it seems to me that this is something which needs to be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords will the

reform bill has been guillotined in another place and a timetable agreed for discussion of the remaining clauses among which are the clauses on ilea surely a separate bill is called for <e> <s> the proposal comes at a time of heavy legislation when parliament is already under pressure from an overloaded programme <e> <s> this proposal was not in the conservative party manifesto nor in the queens speech <e> <s> the government have no mandate for it <e> <s> have the parents been consulted about this <e> <s> have the churches been consulted about this <e> <s> have the teaching staff been consulted about this <e> <s> the government have made much of parental involvement in the education reform bill <e> <s> what parental involvement has there been in this sudden decision <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister one question concerning standards <e> <s> in the sheffield university league table which took into account socio-economic conditions out of local education authorities ilea came th oxfordshire was th waltham forest was st essex was nd and bromley was th <e> <s> if other matters are taken into account ilea has done pretty well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say again that i am shocked that a decision has been taken not to have a separate bill because a great deal of consultation has to go on <e>", "<cs> my lords what arrangements have been made for consultation with the parents governors and teachers in the inner london schools <e> <s> if as i gather the clauses are to be put down today does that not leave a short time for those to be discussed before the matter is debated in committee in a week or two <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly come back the minister has not answered my question about the consultations with parents governors and teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us what is the percentage of vacancies in london and the south east in the shortage subjects such as science and languages <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords could i ask the minister by how many the staff at the des is expected to increase in the next few years <e> <s> in the education reform bill are not the plans for financial delegation to schools and colleges to be referred to the secretary of state <e> <s> that obviously means the civil servants in the des <e> <s> the secretary of state can vary the scheme he can make a new scheme he can agree the scheme <e> <s> there is a great deal of work going to the des <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the des has increased or decreased its staff and by how many in the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does the fact that implementation of the consolidation will occur only after the education reform bill becomes an act not mean that we shall have a succession of education bills almost every year one being brought forward before the last has been fully implemented <e> <s> it will be interesting to know the answer to that question <e> <s> what consultations will there be about consolidation when the process begins <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i was somewhat surprised to see the question of the noble baroness on the order paper considering that the education reform bill is being discussed in another place at this moment and that we shall be discussing these very questions when the rather controversial bill reaches us after easter <e> <s> nonetheless i always admire the way the noble baroness speaks and her eloquence <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us a little more about how it is expected that this service will be funded in <e> <s> at the moment the doe has set grea at million for youth provision while ilea has budgeted for million a great deal of which goes in grants to just those voluntary bodies that the noble lord lord newall asked about such as the london federation of youth clubs and the london adventure playground association <e> <s> these could well collapse if that same grant is to be kept up <e> <s> how will the funding be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not replied to my question <e> <s> will there be a commitment from the government that funds will be available for these extremely good clubs in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if it is still the governments intention to fulfil what the prime minister expressed as her aim when she was secretary of state for education in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the opposition also believe that a problem exists <e> <s> naturally parents do not wish to be separated from their children <e> <s> day schools are needed when parents are abroad for a short time <e> <s> how much are the government now spending in relation to this matter and will the dti produce funds to meet what will be an increasing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i must of course thank the noble baroness for her explanation of the bill but to the bill itself we give no welcome at all <e> <s> we consider it to be one of the most controversial most potentially damaging most ill-considered and most ill-prepared bills with which this house has had to deal <e> <s> perhaps only the financial services bill could compete with it <e> <s> in spite of what the noble baroness said only two months were allowed for consultation before the bill was published and that at a season <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will give way i should like to point out that i specifically mentioned the concessions to the churches and the universities and my noble friend mentioned the changes in special education <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i am only going by the comments that some governors have made to me and by a number of letters <e> <s> they are very anxious to give their services <e> <s> they are slightly worried by the additional responsibility the financial and management responsibility which might be imposed upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot bring myself to thank the minister for that totally unsatisfactory answer <e> <s> is she aware that i have already asked two <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask when a final answer will be given <e> <s> my post is absolutely bulging with letters from people who are anxious about the future of these museums <e> <s> it would be a great help to everybody if the noble baroness could assure us that very soon a definite announcement will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether either of these reports will help encourage more secondary teachers to go into training <e> <s> i understand that there has been a significant drop in particular in the shortage subjects per cent <e> <s> in maths per cent <e> <s> in biology and per cent <e> <s> in physics <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government agree to meet also with the sports council <e> <s> can they give an assurance that these valuable acres will remain for leisure and community use and not be given over to commercial developers <e>", "<cs> i think that the time has come to answer the debate and i shall therefore remain standing <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord joseph for making many of the points which i might have made and which i shall not now have to make <e>", "<cs> it is not at all clear <e> <s> general speeches have been made we have not had the specific amendments spoken to <e> <s> that is absolutely vital <e> <s> we need the specific amendments explained as well as a general statement <e>", "<cs> can i interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i gather that the groupings are supposed to enable a general overall view to be given of that group of amendments <e> <s> however there will be the chance to speak to each one when it is called <e> <s> that is very much more satisfactory <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make another comment about the way in which this whole matter has been handled <e> <s> i believe that it has been profoundly unsatisfactory <e> <s> probably this grouping should never have been agreed to <e> <s> i hope that perhaps tomorrow the minister and some of us could get together and discuss how we are to carry on the committee stage <e> <s> i feel that it cannot go on like this <e> <s> it has been very frustrating to all of us <e>", "<cs> there has been support from all sides of the committee for this group of amendments <e> <s> i should like to add our support <e> <s> i cannot say that i am altogether happy about the wording of some of the amendments or indeed the wording of the bill as the noble lord lord young has said and in particular with the word society which seems to hang <e> <s> i very much hope that when she responds the minister will say that she will think about these amendments and come back with some form of wording at report stage which covers the various points which have been made by a number of speakers <e> <s> i believe that as the noble baroness lady seear mentioned if the government turn down the amendment it will look very bad indeed to the outside world unless something is put into the bill <e>", "<cs> i cannot say i am entirely convinced by what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what she has said and then decide whether to come back on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a further question <e> <s> when the noble baroness was answering i believe she said that it was expected to get in the first <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness mentioned that the next report will be published in due course <e> <s> it would be very helpful if available when we are discussing this part of the bill <e> <s> can the minister give an assurance that it will be published in good time for report stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we could have clarification as to which amendments are being grouped together <e> <s> nobody has said which amendments we are considering yet we are moving on <e>", "<cs> i was not sure that everybody fully understood this <e> <s> i know that i have put down these amendments but this has not been said in the chamber which makes it perhaps difficult for some people <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment briefly on this mammoth list <e> <s> i have great sympathy with every one of the amendments which has been put down particularly that of my noble friend lady blackstone in which she asks for this flexibility between subjects <e> <s> i should like to remind the committee that the last words refer to section above so it relates to what is happening under clause <e> <s> i also have great sympathy with the amendment of the noble baroness lady faithfull because it will be very difficult to keep children of and who are not interested in the core and foundation subjects as listed in the bill at school <e>", "<cs> my name should have appeared on the amendment so i should like to give every support to the noble lord lord craigton <e> <s> as i chaired the environmental education committee when the united kingdom was preparing its response to the world conservation strategy i feel strongly about the issue <e> <s> i too should like to see environmental education mentioned in some way on the face of the bill <e> <s> our discussion earlier on the amendments tabled by the noble lords lord hatch and lord pitt covered some of the arguments <e> <s> i shall not go into them at this hour of the morning <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is mistaken <e> <s> we do not wish her to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> my name is to it and we wish this to be discussed <e> <s> it is a paving amendment to a number of other amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord ritchie is prepared to speak to it <e> <s> his name is there also <e>", "<cs> i support this group of amendments <e> <s> they have the effect of placing the major recommendations of the task group on assessment and testing on the face of the bill <e> <s> the central issue is that four months after the publication of the report the government have still not clarified their policy as to the way in which testing and assessment will be implemented <e> <s> no details are contained in the bill which leaves the form of implementation to ministerial orders <e>", "<cs> so far as i am concerned what the noble baroness said has not satisfied me <e> <s> the noble baroness talked about intentions <e> <s> there is absolutely nothing in the bill <e> <s> the bill has been out for six months <e> <s> the government have had plenty of time to think up amendments for committee stage in the house of lords <e> <s> we are anxious to get something into the bill <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> was moved as a paving amendment to a group of amendments so that they were taken so to speak all together <e> <s> we wish to press the amendments <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble earl actually used the words core subjects <e>", "<cs> is the bill going to be amended at that part to say core and foundation subjects <e> <s> nowhere have we been told that foundation embraces core <e>", "<cs> i shall look carefully at <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble baroness a question about the timescale <e> <s> there will be other possibilities of targets tests or whatever you like to call them at age as well as gcse <e> <s> will the gcse eventually be phased out in favour of the rest <e> <s> can she tell us the number of years before we can expect some changes <e>", "<cs> that was also my grouping <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> i should also like the minister or the mover of the amendment to give the meaning of the word sufficient and say who will decide that <e> <s> is it a word which appears quite often in legislation <e>", "<cs> i think that that is an absolutely ridiculous answer if i may say so <e> <s> there will still be personal appointments under the amendment and apparently the consultation is to be carried out anyway <e> <s> in order to give satisfaction and to appear to be limiting the secretary of states powers by the minutest extent surely it would be sensible to accept the amendment and make a lot of people feel much happier about the bill altogether <e>", "<cs> of course i have to accept that suggestion <e> <s> i must tell the noble baroness that if she had not agreed to take the matter back i should have divided the committee on this issue <e> <s> i feel very strongly about this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> it is an important function of the council to be able to give advice and to initiate a number of matters <e> <s> therefore i should like to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot imagine <e> <s> i am sure that my husband would be very cross indeed if he knew that i had <e>", "<cs> i would accept all those additions <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause has come in for a great deal of criticism from many sides <e> <s> the noble baroness has just said that it was the least understood clause <e> <s> if things are to be put into a bill that are so misunderstood by a great many people who are well acquainted with the world of education i believe that is a great pity and that it has been very badly

on <e>", "<cs> i think it would be nice if the noble baroness would confirm what she has said <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there will still have to be a great many applications and that will take a great deal of time <e> <s> we well know as the noble baroness lady blackstone said how long things sit at the des before there are answers <e> <s> i think there should be much more freedom and i therefore have to press the committee to vote against the clause <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble baroness what my noble friend said about this being a rather redundant body seems to be true <e> <s> i am not clear what its function will be <e>", "<cs> we are pleased with any widening of the information that is to be provided <e> <s> however perhaps the minister can tell us what other assessments the government have in mind <e> <s> what will the further information be about <e>", "<cs> that situation is quite possible <e> <s> there may be several rural primary schools within not a huge area <e> <s> one of them may suddenly become <e>", "<cs> i am just slightly surprised about the rejection which has been so outright <e> <s> as i said in my opening speech by amendment no <e> <s> the government are doing exactly what we want for church schools <e> <s> i cannot think that the idea can be that bad if it is accepted in that situation <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the answer

amendments amendment no <e> <s> a is to clause <e> <s> i know that local authorities <e>", "<cs> what we want to do is to give more parents real choice not some parents <e>", "<cs> if a nursery class has been put into a primary school because numbers have fallen and the classroom is not needed for the purpose for which it was previously used for primary school children would that classroom be counted in the standard number <e> <s> would the nursery class be disregarded and the standard number bolstered when so to speak there was no nursery class there <e>", "<cs> after all this discussion in the morning i shall certainly have to read with the greatest possible care everything that has been said <e> <s> having done that i shall know whether to come back at report stage because i must confess i am not absolutely clear about this matter even now <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the churches have what they want <e> <s> as i said when i moved amendment no <e> <s> a earlier the churches have precisely what we wanted for every school <e> <s> that is somehow ironic <e> <s> i do not wish to be a spoilsport <e> <s> i am glad that somebody has what they want <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness speaking to the amendment or talking generally about the whole subject <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister about the governments reaction to the coopers and lybrand report <e> <s> this was commissioned by the secretary of state in may and it certainly suggested that it would take quite a long time to get lfm schemes in operation <e> <s> it stated that a good deal of money would be needed and to months to undertake the consultation leading to the development of the schemes let alone the actual implementation <e>", "<cs> i thought that we could get quite close on this amendment because as i said we are agreed on the aims <e> <s> we want to go along with local financial management <e> <s> we do not want to have pistols put at the heads of governors <e> <s> i think that the government could have given way on this amendment <e> <s> they have not given way on anything so far <e> <s> i thought that was something on which we might have sympathy so i shall divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> governors will play an important role when the bill becomes an act

<e> <s> i wish to ask the minister a few questions <e> <s> i should like to know what safeguards there will be for children in special schools if they opt out <e> <s> there are at present tremendous support services from the local authorities which would presumably have to be bought if the school opted out <e> <s> a great many non-maintained special schools and independent schools deal with children who have special needs <e> <s> the local authorities often pay the fees of such schools but when they do i understand that the department of education and science has to agree to it <e> <s> there is therefore a safeguard that the children are being sent to schools where there is proper care and attention and the facilities that they need <e> <s> what would be the safeguards if a special school opted out <e> <s> this might be done without the parents and governing body having a great deal of knowledge although one hopes that that would not be so <e>", "<cs> we wish to oppose clause <e> <s> this is the only opportunity to say that we do not like the principle of opting out <e> <s> in spite of the recent vote where the ballot has certainly been made fairer than it was it still

are just about <e>", "<cs> good both of them <e> <s> i do not know who is going to be dealing with this <e> <s> i do not think parent governors should stay after the end of the year in which their

baroness how long she thought parents should go on being governors after their children have left <e>", "<cs> i can see that there are arguments on both sides <e> <s> if one is really keen on having parent governors it is more important that they should be there when their children are at the school and if they are useful they could be kept on in another category <e> <s> i do not think that this

correct <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to hear about these amendments because we have previously complained of staff not being consulted and taken into consideration as regards grant-maintained schools <e>

ask someone from the local authority to come on the governing body <e> <s> that is rather monstrous <e> <s> if it requires the services of an inspector welfare and so on presumably it will need to pay

amendment because it involves consultation only with those parents who may well be attending the school in the future <e> <s> i believe it to be only fair and right that they should have a chance to

able to accept the amendment or the principle of it <e> <s> the wording may not be perfect but i hope that he will accept the spirit of it <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to the noble lords comments <e> <s> the minister appears to accept that there is a problem and that the parents should be consulted <e> <s> is he prepared to come back with his own wording making some kind of consultation process possible <e>", "<cs> presumably they would then be transferred to a local authority school <e> <s> that would be the only possibility <e>", "<cs> i should like to support that amendment to

however it is rather a one-way transaction <e> <s> the local authority is receiving somebody from a grant-maintained school but the grant-maintained school is making no gesture in the other direction

minister why that process is not placed under the control of the education assets board the expert body which was appointed for the purpose of receiving and passing property on to new institutions <e>

that corporal punishment was degrading <e> <s> i think that is correct <e> <s> so far as consultation is concerned i said that mr christopher everett head of tonbridge school and chairman of the headmasters conference said two years ago that it would have been better if corporal punishment had been outlawed in independent schools <e> <s> i think that one can count that to be as good as

the centre about what local education authorities do <e> <s> what we are afraid of is that under the new arrangements the leas will not have a co-ordinating role <e> <s> that is what we wanted to ascertain from these amendments <e>", "<cs> this provision is thought to be very unfair because the clause gives the secretary of state powers to change the status of an existing further education

lecturer in the same establishment does that mean that he or she will lose tenure <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the right reverend prelates <e> <s> we also think that this is unnecessary <e> <s> i understand that the cvcp has been meeting the noble and learned lord and that discussions are still going on on this subject <e> <s> is it not therefore somewhat premature to introduce the amendment at this moment <e>", "<cs> do i gather that the noble and learned lord will not convey to his right honourable friend that there have been misgivings about this matter and perhaps wait until report stage to bring forward this amendment again after further discussion <e>", "<cs> we should like to give our support to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i should have said that i do not intend to move that amendment <e>", "<cs> could it be used to help set up grant-maintained schools <e> <s> i am not clear that it cannot do many other things which the minister has not mentioned <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the minister has said <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i am satisfied but i shall not pursue the matter at this time of night <e> <s> if i wish to come back i shall do so at the next stage and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are glad to welcome these new clauses <e> <s> they have been a long time coming <e> <s> i understand that for the past years efforts have been made to bring them into force <e> <s> at last the des and the civil servants have found a way of providing them <e> <s> i understand that other countries have had such provisions for a long time <e>", "<cs> my name also appears in connection with the amendment and i should like to add my support <e> <s> there is a very real problem and i hope that if the particular solution is not acceptable to the government they will come up with another solution <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that quite positive response even if it does not go the whole way <e> <s> in the light of that response and that certain commitment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have asked a question on this matter at least twice in written form and that i put an oral question to him last month <e> <s> from among the ranks of its very famous civil servants with general qualifications does the des have people with the necessary experience <e> <s> do they have teaching experience the professional experience of teaching in schools or further education establishments or even experience in administration in local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that hmi is independent of the des and that the two are quite separate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it right that the training is to be given by the various leas round the country or organised by the governors of grant-maintained schools or city technology colleges <e> <s> what monitoring will there be of the training <e> <s> what monitoring will there be when qualified teacher status is finally given <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up that by asking whether the government will help leas with the expense of this extra in-service training <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the minister that when teachers first enter the profession under licence they will have less salary than a qualified teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord joseph the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and the noble earl lord baldwin <e> <s> we have made quite clear from the beginning that we disliked the rigidity and inflexibility of the national curriculum as it appears in this bill <e> <s> we think that it will make no difference to raising the standards of education in this country <e> <s> it does not have the confidence of the teaching profession nor indeed of the administrators in the county councils and in the metropolitan councils <e> <s> this bill has a great many enemies <e> <s> the rigidity of the curriculum underlies that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all took the remarks of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with several grains of salt <e>", "<cs> my lords pinches that is right <e> <s> what i fail to understand and this has been the case throughout the bill is that the minister assures us that the framework is flexible and that there will be cross-curricular possibilities within the curriculum <e> <s> why is that not on the face of the bill <e> <s> parents and teachers do not like such headings <e> <s> they do not understand them <e> <s> every effort we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment and the theme of the three amendments about which we have been talking <e> <s> whatever the noble and learned lord may say there are many people who feel that something is missing from the bill <e> <s> it is a recognition that the world has changed considerably since and so indeed has this country <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord could have drafted an amendment which would have covered this it is a great pity that he did not take the trouble to do so because that might have saved us a great deal of time <e> <s> perhaps he may still try to do so and that would be a help to all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord still fails to recognise the problem which the people who moved these amendments are trying to address <e> <s> that is a pity and in a way it shows the narrowness of this bill about which we complained a good deal in committee and are now complaining at report stage <e> <s> all i wish to say is that here is a problem <e> <s> it has not been resolved <e> <s> i should like to voice my support <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the reasons that the amendment has been put forward is the uncertainty surrounding the national curriculum <e> <s> we do not yet know exactly what will happen and when although the bill is at report stage in the house of lords <e> <s> the responses of the government to the various reports are very late <e> <s> the tgat report was published at the end of last year and the government did not make a firm response for some time <e> <s> the supplementary reports which were requested have only this month been responded to by the government <e> <s> there is a great deal of uncertainty everywhere as to what will happen and when <e> <s> it exists among local authorities teachers and parents <e> <s> the amendment attempts to lay down an orderly process for discovering that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister before she sits down whether it would be helpful as i am sure there will be confusion among the general public and those who will subsequently read the clause to include in the bill some phrase which would show that the term foundation subjects embraces the core subjects <e> <s> if we have all misunderstood the issue i am quite sure that many other people will find the same difficulty <e> <s> therefore would it not help to further clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that one can ask questions that have arisen out of a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to challenge that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather mystified by one comment that the minister made at the end of her remarks to the effect that ctcs would only have to follow the substance of the national curriculum i am not quite sure what the substance may be because they were independent schools <e> <s> well grant-maintained schools will be independent schools but they also have to follow the national curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords the funding will come from the same source <e> <s> the ctcs will have to be funded by the des just as the grant-maintained schools are funded <e> <s> there will not be enough coming from private industry to do the funding as well as the initial setting up and there does not even seem to be enough for the initial setting up anyway <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for her explanation which i shall read with interest <e> <s> i hope that i am fully enlightened when i have done so <e> <s> i believe i understand what she was saying that it is a matter that has caused a good deal of anxiety in a great many quarters <e> <s> i am glad that we now have in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we hoped very much that the government would put down an amendment to this effect <e> <s> there was no absolute commitment but the noble baroness did say that she would take the matter back and give it further consideration <e> <s> we hoped for a positive response from the government <e> <s> there have been few positive responses but we hoped for one <e> <s> too much is being done by negative resolution <e> <s> i hope that we shall have a full explanation from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we know that the noble lord lord young is a splendid libertarian and that that would be the line he would be likely to take <e> <s> i had a certain unease when i read the amendments and did not feel happy about them <e> <s> the more that i listen to the debate the more it appears to be based on the lewes case and the more i dislike making arrangements for the general from the particular <e> <s> that is what the house appears to be doing tonight <e> <s> i believe that more noble lords have spoken about the lewes case than about anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not sure that we were discussing other amendments <e> <s> which other amendments is the noble baroness referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> of course we were also discussing amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name and that of the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley <e> <s> i cannot say that i am altogether satisfied with the reply <e> <s> i think that the consultation has been fairly perfunctory <e> <s> it seems to me rather odd that appointments are made before the bill is enacted <e> <s> we cannot deny that these shadows will doubtless have substance later <e> <s> however i shall not divide the house at this time of night <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> it has been recognised all round the house that it is important that the parents of pupils at primary school those likely to be in the catchment area of the possible future grant-maintained school should have some kind of voice in what will happen to the school their children will be attending <e> <s> in one way it seems to be much more important that they should have a say rather than the parents of children who are about to leave <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support to this amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness said circumstances can change dramatically and as the bill stands there is no possibility except by closing the school of doing anything to meet that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is in my name also <e> <s> i am not prepared to withdraw it <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not make that point clear when i spoke <e> <s> i am not agreeable to withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree to that but i understand that the noble baroness will not agree <e> <s> she is shaking her head <e> <s> that happy situation and solution is not available to us <e> <s> i wish it were <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she make clear what the governments proposal is <e> <s> i have not mastered it <e> <s> i think that she said one parent one vote was made clear in one subsection of clause <e> <s> would she mind repeating what the governments solution is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness mentioned clause something <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no use saying that there will be guidance <e> <s> the matter is complicated as has been made abundantly clear from the discussions on the amendment <e> <s> the governing bodies may not accept the guidance which is offered <e> <s> it is essential that something about this extremely important matter should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> one parent one vote is not clearly in the bill <e> <s> one parent one vote is not nearly as satisfactory as one child one vote <e> <s> it is not fair where there is more than one child in a family <e> <s> it is the children at whom we must be looking not the parents <e> <s> if there are three children then three votes seems abundantly fair <e> <s> i think that i must divide the house on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting used to the government saying no <e> <s> i still do not believe that the experience argument carries any weight at all <e> <s> i think that the fact that the child is leaving is far more important and that the interests of the parents will be bound to get less unless of course there are other children of the same family attending that school <e> <s> in that case the parents will have a vote anyway <e> <s> as regards parents being able to choose another school there may not be another school in the neighbourhood if the only secondary school in that neighbourhood decides to opt out <e> <s> there may be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say too that i am extremely pleased that the government have made a concession on this important matter <e> <s> i think that i supported the noble baroness when she moved her amendment and i am delighted that the government have seen the light about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry naturally to hear the remarks of the noble baroness because the amendment included in its wording <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume from what the noble earl has said that this is a government inspired amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when i notice that members of the government front bench are talking to each other and not listening to me i believe that it is quite justifiable to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not continue the conversation but i shall watch with care <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised if the government believe that their restrictions are so strong that they are not willing to accept those proposed in the amendments <e> <s> however i am not going to fight the issue at this time of night knowing the pressure of time <e> <s> therefore rather reluctantly i accept the ministers response and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister goes at great pace <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not receive the letter <e> <s> it would have been much easier to understand given the fast speed at which the minister is reading <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he saying that church schools are the equivalent of grant-maintained schools <e> <s> i find that somewhat odd <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not put the nearest appropriate school in my amendment <e> <s> i will look at what the minister said and in the meantime beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anybody from these benches has yet spoken in support of the amendment but we support the idea behind it very strongly <e> <s> i went with the noble baroness lady faithfull to see the noble lord lord joseph when he was secretary of state <e> <s> we were worried about the role of the education welfare officers at that time <e> <s> regular reports are important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most disappointed in the answer of the noble baroness <e> <s> she has had great support from all sides of the house <e> <s> it must be said that third reading is a very late stage at which to bring forward anything new <e> <s> i do not think that there is any hope of getting anything unless we make a stand now <e> <s> therefore if the noble baroness is not prepared to divide the house on the matter then i am <e> <s> i believe that it is the privilege of any member of the house so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may follow up the funding aspect <e> <s> she said just now that million has <e>", "<cs> my lords it was that the figures are million by industry and million by the treasury which is exactly the opposite of what was proposed by the secretary of state in his pronouncement in <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not seem to me that the evidence quite bears out what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> the most recent news we have is of the middlesbrough ctc in cleveland <e> <s> this is the one that has had some money from british american tobacco which has caused people to raise their eyebrows in several areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i made my comment about the government planted amendment in the same clause last time <e> <s> i shall not bother to divide the house this time but i wonder why the government did not bother to put down this amendment themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords apparently the noble baroness does not intend to reply <e> <s> i simply cannot understand why it is undesirable <e> <s> as my noble friend lady blackstone says these young people may well have the vote <e> <s> many students in their second year at sixth form colleges are aged <e> <s> i assure the minister that they do consider it insulting <e> <s> i know that those on the governing body of the sixth form college where i am a governor wrote to mr kenneth baker asking him to think again <e> <s> he did not bother to reply <e> <s> i think that was insulting <e> <s> i eventually put down a question and that of course received a negative answer too <e> <s> i believe it is very unimaginative of the government not to give way on this because it is such a simple matter <e> <s> after all if pupils can be governors of a college of further education why on earth should they not be at a sixth-form college <e> <s> i feel strongly about this so i shall divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> we have long wanted the provision of adult education to be a duty of the local authority and now is the opportunity to have it so made <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of the house to the second part of amendment no <e> <s> which states <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will she say whether she agrees with the final part of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that answer <e> <s> i believe that the breadth which is suggested in the amendments and the representation which would be assured by having at least two respresentatives of each of the categories would be a great addition <e> <s> however i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the answer <e> <s> one cannot help feeling that somehow there is a certain hostility towards tertiary colleges as the government are so unwilling to be flexible on this <e> <s> it really should be an easy transition <e> <s> in fact of course i think it is a terrible pity that further education regulations and school regulations cannot be gathered together but i understand that is very difficult in view of the conditions of service of the teachers and so on <e> <s> however i consider the government are being inflexible and i shall test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are thankful for small mercies too <e> <s> when the government give something it is indeed agreeable <e> <s> i too am sorry that in a way it is a rather weak amendment <e> <s> the phrase shall also have regard is not very strong <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in order <e> <s> if the noble lord chose to speak early on in the debate as he did others may speak afterwards <e> <s> i believe that to be correct according to standing orders and the clerk at the table agrees that i am correct <e> <s> in that circumstance i believe it is in order for other noble lords to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no more satisfied with that answer than i was with the answer given last time <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord is not willing to change his mind i must test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add our strong support to this very positive suggestion by the noble lord lord perry about continuing education <e> <s> just as adult education has been neglected and we spoke about that earlier this afternoon so continuing education needs a boost <e> <s> to have a positive statutory committee which was devoted to it would be an enormous help <e> <s> we know how much the noble lord lord perry has done for continuing education with the open university <e> <s> i think that it would be very helpful if the house tonight could give its support to this suggestion <e> <s> i shall not take up the time of the house any longer but i hope that we shall have strong support for this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said this is a probing amendment and i have had a full explanation from the minister <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been some very interesting speeches <e> <s> perhaps one of the most interesting was the very balanced speech of the noble lord lord carlisle who has been through all this <e> <s> he has had the experience of wondering what to do about ilea and coming down on the side of retaining it <e> <s> we have all been greatly moved by the letters we have received from parents and teachers in the inner london area <e> <s> i believe that we are all very distressed about the education of children in inner london because of what is now happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke only to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that at the beginning of her remarks i was not at all sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a comment about these amendments because they will mean that there is considerable disruption in the middle of the academic year if the change occurs in april <e> <s> it could interfere with the interviewing and selection of teachers and other work of that kind which is undertaken by governing bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment gives wide and sweeping powers to the london residuary body <e> <s> subsection b reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am altogether satisfied with the answer but at this time of the morning i shall make do with it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i very much wish to add my support to this amendment <e> <s> it seems quite ridiculous that some way cannot he found to solve this problem which is a very real one <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble and learned lord for his letter about the matter of visitors <e> <s> i was one of those who spoke on the matter in committee <e> <s> i am grateful for the letter and i believe that this is a satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady blackstone who had tabled amendment no <e> <s> she has asked me to say that she is very grateful for this amendment <e> <s> however she wants an assurance that the discretion given to the minister in the amendment would be used in such a way that there would be no diminution in the use of section funding to the new pcfc institutions as compared with current levels <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she answer my question on whether the secretary of state has the power to give grants to the proposed trust which will promote the development of grant-maintained schools under section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find that answer at all satisfactory but i am certainly not going to divide the house at this hour <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that these regulations are proposed to take account of the governments consultative document on qualified teacher status <e> <s> i am not quite clear about what is to happen <e> <s> it seems that the making of the regulations on the matters covered in the amendment do not create a new power <e> <s> i ask why the matter is brought up now in this way and i ask the minister for assurances that there will be the fullest consultations with all the relevant interests including in particular the local authority associations representing the employers of teachers on the new regulations which certainly embody considerable changes to existing practice <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not an altogether unexpected reply and i am disappointed with it <e> <s> however i shall not press the matter now <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to do the same <e> <s> my name is attached to the amendment and i feel i should just say that i support it strongly <e> <s> the noble baroness moved it extremely ably and i hope we shall have a warm response from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked to say on behalf of my noble friend lord prys-davies how pleased he is that this amendment has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for his explanation <e> <s> we had expected that the government would come up with some sort of compromise at this stage but we are not at all satisfied with the compromise that has been offered <e> <s> it is true that there is a minor improvement but it is not enough to be satisfactory <e> <s> we hoped that something rather more generous would have been offered <e> <s> it still remains that if per cent <e> <s> of the parents vote on the first ballot per cent <e> <s> plus one parent could determine this extremely important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who had her name attached to this amendment when it was brought forward by the noble baroness lady young both at the committee and report stages i also express my disappointment that this is all that is to come out of it <e> <s> it is extremely disappointing <e> <s> as the noble baroness said the amendment does absolutely nothing new <e> <s> already there is inspection of schools and so on <e> <s> i hope very much as does the noble baroness that there will be some progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but it is nothing to be complacent about <e> <s> does he agree with the interim advisory report on teachers pay from which he has just quoted which claims that recruitment to the teaching force is becoming more difficult and acute in particular areas and that five out of teachers who qualify do not take up teaching in the following academic year <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very remiss when i asked my first supplementary question in not welcoming the noble viscount to his new job <e>", "<cs> i wish him every good fortune in it <e> <s> we shall have many questions for him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that draft circular dropped onto my desk yesterday as it has no doubt dropped on many other desks around the country and another draft circular dropped on my desk today <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister because it is not clear whether the general public are being made aware of what is going on because there is a great deal of anxiety among parents who are not governors and other members of the general community <e> <s> can he give any assurance that that information which is causing a great deal of work in education authorities is also being spread to members of the public generally <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it was not dissatisfaction with the results that worried the students who took the examination <e> <s> it was not getting the results with the consequent very difficult arrangements for their next course of study <e> <s> that was what caused the upset <e> <s> i should like it on record that i am also very pleased with the report of the inspectors <e> <s> i am pleased also that the examination has got off to a very good start <e>", "<cs> my lords a moment ago the minister mentioned there had been a fall in nercs funding because of less commissioned work from the private sector <e> <s> is it not a fact that there has been an even greater fall in commissioned work from the government and that that has made a substantial difference <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government are apparently so keen to increase the number of students in higher education will the minister agree to make it possible for those year-olds in various local authorities in the north of england who have good o-levels say five subjects and who are leaving to stay on at school <e> <s> in fact per cent <e> <s> of those with five o-levels are leaving <e> <s> is that not a terrible waste <e> <s> are the government prepared to help such young people to stay on at school <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement which is being given in another place by his right honourable friend <e> <s> the statement on the financing of students in higher education for which we have been waiting for two years has clearly been a very hot potato to handle <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers answer was reassuring <e> <s> does it apply also to individual colleges which may have appeals for endowments and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply but perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i was referring not to polytechnics and colleges in the public sector but to colleges in the university sector which may have their own appeals <e> <s> does the situation apply to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as another non-economist <e> <s> i want to speak about sponsorship and subsidy their use by this government and what that use tells us about the values and attitudes of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of my noble friend lady white can the minister say whether it is the policy or indeed the wish of the secretary of state to prevent the nature conservancy council acquiring any new national nature reserves at any time <e> <s> there is at least one at caenlochan a very important reserve that is up for sale at the moment <e> <s> can the minister please respond to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel rather nervous speaking after five lawyers <e> <s> however i shall add my voice to the general welcome given to the bill <e> <s> we have waited a long time for it but should like to congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the department of health on the consultations they have held and on the fact that they have listened to what has been said to them and made some changes as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that response <e> <s> is he aware that the principle of making no charge for any travel connected with activities relating to the curriculum or examinations is very welcome <e> <s> but is he also aware that field trips for example for geography or for botanical purposes may take the children some distance from the school and be very expensive <e> <s> will the department give leas enough money to fund those journeys which have not always in the past been funded from school funds <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is not only field trips in regard to geography and so on that could be affected but also trips to some theatres and cinemas which put on special performances for instance of plays set for examinations <e> <s> i have today received a letter from the aldeburgh cinema which said that not only have they put on films of set plays but also performances by ossian ellis and yehudi menuhin and that the schools can claim a third of the fares from the regional arts association <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that this sort of thing could be lost unless the government are prepared adequately to fund the local authorities when the expense is put upon their shoulders <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments intention that police officers who are not parents of children at the school should be appointed as governors <e> <s> i have received a communication from one area of the country which states specifically that police officers shall not take on the duties of school governor unless they are parents <e> <s> the explanation is that this would mean that resources would be engaged in that way <e> <s> may we know the governments attitude to that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the department putting forward any evidence or taking a line about which way this matter should go <e>", "<cs> i thank all who have spoken and i am pleased to note the interest that the amendment aroused <e> <s> i must say that there were moments when i wondered whether noble lords had read the amendment with care <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton said that it gives a child the last word <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> the concluding words of the amendment state <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> i think that i am convinced by it but i should naturally like to read what he said with great care <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask one question about this <e> <s> as regards the level of a childs understanding would not rules of court possibly help in obtaining a similar practice in different areas of the country <e> <s> practice in different courts can be very different in different parts of the country particularly perhaps as regards the concept of levels of understanding <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord has considered the practice in different courts all over the country and whether rules of court would not be of any assistance there <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord whether it is intended under the bill that only disputed cases should be the subject of family proceedings <e> <s> if the cases are disputed surely it is important that there should be a report <e> <s> i ask that question in order to try to clarify the matter <e>", "<cs> i think that everything has been said on this matter and the case has been very well made <e> <s> i should like to add my support to the amendment <e>", "<cs> we did not move our amendment no <e> <s> which deals with a very similar situation because on the whole we preferred the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> which he moved very briefly <e> <s> he did not go into the arguments <e> <s> if we consider what happens now we cannot be altogether happy about the situation <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has mentioned the case of the high court and the county court where children can be made parties to family proceedings and the matrimonial causes rules to permit children to be

meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question <e> <s> what i understand is that the arguments may be not about the parents having contact but a dispute between the parents and other family members <e> <s> i am not sure how that would be resolved under section <e>", "<cs> so long as people know what is in the schedule and what is connected with it that is all right <e> <s> i suppose that guidance and help will he available because people reading only part of the bill will not plough through the long schedules <e> <s> i hope that general guidance will be issued although i appreciate that what is in the schedule covers the point <e> <s> i must leave the matter in the hope that there will be plenty of guidance and i propose to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may now have the opportunity not to move the next group of amendments to which i have already spoken <e> <s> we could then finish clause <e>", "<cs> i am becoming quite used to the answer that clause covers absolutely everything <e> <s> that seems to have been the reply to a great many of the amendments which i have proposed <e>", "<cs> thank you very

considered i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment has certainly provoked considerable discussion <e> <s> i believe that it is an important matter <e> <s> the government have had a change of heart about it <e> <s> they were not intending to allow these homes and i know that they are not actually saying that they intend to do so now <e> <s> they are keeping that possibility <e> <s> however they did say fairly firmly that they were going to prohibit the locking up of children in voluntary homes <e> <s> that seems to be a situation that has changed <e> <s> we have not had a good reason for the change of heart <e>", "<cs> i feel rather humble speaking after so many expert speakers <e> <s> however i have put my name to the amendment and therefore i think that i must say a few words <e> <s> indeed there are two aspects of the amendment on which i should like to comment <e> <s> we have heard from two experts in the social services field the noble lord lord seebohm who produced his report nearly years ago and the noble baroness lady faithfull who is a former director of social services and chairman of a very successful and effective all-party childrens group <e> <s> then we heard from the noble lord lord henderson with his experience of parliament and what this house can and cannot do <e>", "<cs> the governments attitude is all right i am pleased with their sympathetic approach because it is what we should all wish to achieve <e> <s> i believe that we are back to the question of resources <e> <s> the kind of provision which essex county council makes in bowles court where there is almost a one-for-one relationship with staff and young people and the expensive foster care provisions made by kent county council cost money <e> <s> of course they cost revenue money <e> <s> if the government really want to improve the situation i believe that they will have to provide more resources for local government to secure that <e> <s> of course i shall not press this matter at this time of night but i shall look at it again <e> <s> i believe that this is an issue of money and i may come back to it at another stage <e> <s> however i am glad that the principle at least seems to be accepted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as my name is also down to the amendment i must say one or two words <e> <s> i think the aim is to discourage the physical punishment of children and to reduce child abuse <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord henderson i believe that the amendment certainly does not stop the common law right of parents to administer reasonable and moderate punishment however one defines reasonable and moderate <e> <s> the meaning has probably changed a good deal over the years and will go on changing <e>", "<cs> i should like to make clear to the committee that the noble lord lord irvine of lairg cannot be present tonight and that therefore most of the amendments in his name will not be moved <e> <s> that may give a certain amount of pleasure to some members of the committee <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> will not be moved but i shall have something to say about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his further explanation which i am quite sure that my noble friend will be pleased to read <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord meston that it is a pity that we do not have the government amendments to this clause <e> <s> indeed i read in the notes on clauses to clauses and that there are to be further amendments <e> <s> we may not even have those at report stage or third reading here <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble and learned lord can tell us whether we shall have those amendments by the next stage <e> <s> we very much hope that we shall do so <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his further reply <e>", "<cs> clause deals with wardship <e> <s> it therefore did not seem totally wrong to bring this matter forward <e> <s> on the point put forward by the noble lord lord meston i understand that the official solicitor is not always the voice of the child as he suggested he was <e> <s> however i shall once again read what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> in the meantime i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add my support as my name is on the amendment which has been so admirably spoken to by the noble baroness and the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment would be a great improvement and i hope that the noble and learned lord will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak about the quality of life for children in two aspects their extra vulnerability to pollutants to which we are all subject and the need to give them knowledge about their environment through environmental education <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendments <e> <s> it seems to me important to have the duty mentioned early in the bill that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble a nd learned lord has given almost the same answer as he gave last time <e> <s> it is not satisfactory because clause is unlikely to have the same effect as the proposed amendment <e> <s> the amendment is more likely to enable children to participate in family proceedings <e> <s> it deals particularly with children rather than persons and emphasises the frequently overlooked question of the childs status <e> <s> it is intended to draw the childs status to the attention of the court and would appear in the section of the bill dealing with section orders <e> <s> it is in respect of such orders currently custody and access orders that the childrens legal centre most frequently hears from children and young people that their wishes and feelings have not been taken into account <e> <s> the wording of clause is merely permissive and therefore i ask the noble and learned lord to think again about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am partially satisfied <e> <s> it seems that a group such as the family rights group which has a great deal of experience in dealing with parents children and courts knows a good deal of what it is speaking about on this subject <e> <s> it must have had a very strong reason for wishing this amendment to go forward with paragraph d being deleted <e> <s> obviously no one would mind about <e> <s> dii because that is all right <e> <s> it is di which states -the authoritys plans which seems to be the stumbling block <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it anomalous that clause does not allow a child the right to consent to a move abroad when he or she is subject to a residence order while the bill grants this right to a child who is the subject of a care order <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can give the reasons for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> like the noble lord lord henderson i should like to congratulate the government on clause c which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> it would be a great reassurance to disabled parents to know that the bill contained this provision <e> <s> i am delighted to find the name of the noble baroness lady faithfull attached to the amendments <e> <s> she has raised the important point that the children of disabled people may be a heavy burden in many ways on the social services <e> <s> they need a great deal of support <e> <s> i hope that the major reassurance provided by the amendment can be incorporated in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say something now as i gather that it will not be well received if i speak after the noble and learned lord has spoken <e> <s> the range and level of services should be appropriate to childrens needs rather than what a local authority considers appropriate <e> <s> that is very important <e> <s> i have before me a document which tells me the percentage of three and four year-olds in nursery schools nursery classes and infant classes <e> <s> i am well aware that this is not the same as day care <e> <s> however i am sure it gives one a good idea of how different local authorities produce very different services <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these amendments very strongly <e> <s> there is not only womens need to have their children in day care but also the countrys need to have women in the workforce <e> <s> so it seems to me that there are two strong arguments for this provision and i should have thought that the noble and learned lord would have accepted this double reason <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him a question about the phrases may provide and as they consider appropriate <e> <s> could they provide nothing if they thought that that was appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i was seeking to clarify the definition of children in need <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make clear before the noble and learned lord replies that we are asking not that the local authorities should provide all these services but that they should ensure that there is some provision within their areas <e> <s> that is slightly different but it is a very important point <e> <s> there is also another point about the workforce women find it very difficult to take full-time work and also to collect their children at or oclock to take them home <e> <s> there will be a gap until or and there should be some provision that they can use whether it is provided by the authority or some voluntary organisation <e> <s> some arrangement should be made <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will look kindly on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously with that reassurance from the noble and learned lord i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and look forward to what will come out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it was a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> i shall read with care in the morning what the noble and learned lord said rather fast <e> <s> if needs be i shall come back with something again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord when he replies could tell us why as the suggestion that there should be a written agreement was included in the white paper and i think went into the previous consultations it has not been included in the bill <e> <s> i think that that omission is quite a disappointment to many of us in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will probably cover the first half of the amendment we are grateful for that <e> <s> the other element which is not covered by his amendment would enable an allowance to be paid to relatives <e> <s> that seems important because relatives if they have support may be willing to take on nieces nephews grandchildren and so forth <e> <s> it would be much better for those children to be with their relatives <e> <s> the relatives would be encouraged to take the children if they could have some compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry to differ from my noble friend on the front bench but i think that the noble baroness and the noble lord lord redesdale are making a very important point about the new type of relationship <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is on the amendment but i have been waiting to speak because i expected that someone such as the noble lord lord mottistone would say it didnt do me any harm when i was a child <e> <s> i find that approach slightly offensive but i do not want to be nasty to the noble lord whom i very much like <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is attached to this amendment and it has been spoken to so ably from all sides of the house that i do not think i need add much <e> <s> however i should like to thank the noble baroness lady faithfull

support the amendment <e> <s> we all know what it is like to have an unwelcome visitor and people we would rather not see when they come to the front door <e> <s> it is in line with the general

lords does the minister realise that in some cases i have read about neither the head teacher nor the governors knew what had been going on in the schools <e> <s> apparently one teacher had been

for the pool of inactive teachers <e> <s> there are as has been said about qualified teachers who are not currently employed as teachers roughly the same number as those employed <e> <s> more than half of them are women aged between and so it is reasonable to assume that a large number are involved in child bearing and child rearing <e> <s> half of the entrants to teaching jobs are re-entrants

with the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the fact that the percentage staying on at school was only per cent <e> <s> whereas the total continuing in education after school leaving age was per cent <e> <s> shows that sixth form colleges and tertiary colleges or further education colleges are very much more successful than small sixth forms in schools <e> <s> are the government now taking a more reasonable attitude towards tertiary colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord rochester on his good fortune in initiating this debate at such an opportune time only three weeks after the breakfast-time launch of the training enterprise councils a launch in four cities with live video links coloured lights and music i am told <e>", "<cs> my

consultation is now over <e> <s> are we to expect legislation about loans <e>", "<cs> my lords further to one answer given by the noble viscount does he accept that students already contribute a great deal and pay for themselves in many ways resulting in their getting into debt which a large number of them are doing at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in his speech at lancaster in january on higher education years <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is it not a fact that there has been a complaint made under section of the education act to the secretary of state about the failure to educate all these children in school <e> <s> what will he do about it <e> <s> is it not his legal responsibility when a complaint has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister

discussed previously on th december last year i asked whether the ncc would be able to acquire any sites during this waiting period <e> <s> i asked especially about caenlochan which is a very valuable

question i asked was this <e> <s> if a valuable site was put up for sale and was ready to be acquired would the ncc be able to acquire it at present while the matter is under consideration <e> <s> i

viscount did not answer my previous question about whether there is any difficulty in recruiting governors certainly it is apparent that there is difficulty in some cases <e> <s> may i therefore ask

be bound by their clause duties on their activities relating to all land <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am not a little disappointed but i am not altogether surprised <e> <s> i am grateful for the ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the reason for ilea having some surplus playing fields that the number of children in london has substantially declined <e> <s> is it not also because it has only million for the maintenance of buildings and it desperately needs the cash of which the secretary of state has kept it so short <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the des makes money available through the education support grants to help with education about drugs in schools but that this money will be available only for one year <e> <s> what are the educational plans for continuing the grants after the one year <e> <s> surely education will be needed for more than one year to cope with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i look upon his reply with a good deal of scepticism <e> <s> i wonder whether he has read the report and is aware that the minister responsible for higher education mr jackson stated in a letter to the university college

the minister say whether the government are to take the advice of the audit commission which after all is their own creation <e> <s> that body advises that even per cent <e> <s> of the money to be released from council house sales put toward the repair of houses would mean that there would be many more houses available to rent <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put my name to this amendment and i

purchase particularly in view of the secretary of states previous statements that he expects that expenditure to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords will there be any monitoring <e> <s> i understand that pilot schools have kept up the level of expenditure even if it is not high enough to what it was before <e> <s> however there needs to be monitoring because in the light of the gcse and the national

published this year in which it is stated <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who has been active in local government as a councillor and as a spokesman for local government in this house i must say that i feel angry about many proposals in this bill <e> <s> there are some parts of which i approve for instance the duty to allocate seats to political groups and the duty to give effect to allocations in clauses and <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman referred to what happened on the cambridgeshire county council in after reorganisation <e> <s> i totally agree with the noble baroness that giving a

autumn <e> <s> i refer to the problem of children leaving care with nowhere to go together with the problem of certain other groups which are referred to in the noble baronesss amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i received a letter but i said that it did not give me quite the satisfaction that i had hoped it would <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may remind him that he has not answered one of my questions namely about the draft regulations which according to the article in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not only referring to housing benefit <e> <s> i was referring to the other support <e>", "<cs> surely the word should be recurrence <e> <s> there is a mistake in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall have to read what the minister said and consult my friends in the library association <e> <s> they are extremely worried about what may happen and they feel that there may be a total collapse of this service if flexibility is not there <e> <s> they have one other proposal which the minister might consider <e> <s> it is that the minister could use his powers to exempt all companies with a turnover below a certain threshold a <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very strong speech from the noble lord and i can agree with only half of it as will become apparent as i speak <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply particularly the last few words saying that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed with the ministers answer <e> <s> i had not believed that the amendment was perfect but i had hoped that in the weeks since we saw him he would have thought of a way around the issue and that we should have had a more sensible response <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed at that reply <e> <s> indeed i am rather shocked <e> <s> the sums involved are small <e> <s> it would be very easy to exempt these companies by name <e> <s> the minister gave no examples of other companies which might suddenly wish to join the queue <e> <s> his reply shows the governments general lack of care about education and the arts <e> <s> we are very proud of public libraries <e> <s> it is a great shame that they cannot have the help that exempting these regional companies would give <e> <s> i shall not waste any more time <e> <s> i shall test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister think that that is perhaps a rather complacent reply in the light of the survey carried out recently by the six teaching unions which showed the position to be substantially worse than the des reported to the interim advisory committee <e> <s> is it true that the des survey was carried out by ringing round the various authorities whereas the unions survey was carried out by a very well-documented questionnaire which went out to heads of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how very pleased i am to see amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> we

i did not spot the age of eight years <e> <s> we tried to change it to years in later amendments and clearly it is a point which we missed <e> <s> i should prefer to have seen the age of but it is too late to do anything about it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> it is not very strong <e> <s> there have been a number of efforts in the course of the bill passing

difficulties have been recognised and that possibly this rather mild amendment might be accepted as a form of compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords at every stage of the bill as it went through this house we had a great many discussions on this subject of young people leaving care <e> <s> although promises were given about monitoring i believe that the situation has changed <e> <s> it has become worse

situation is becoming very much worse for these young people <e> <s> more and more of them are becoming homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to see these amendments <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said we had considerable discussions <e> <s> he was good <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what the responses were which had to be in by th september to the consultation paper issued by the scottish development department <e> <s> is it the case that were opposed and had reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the minister said regarding the possibility of smaller authorities sharing <e> <s> but is the local education support grant to be increased so that some authorities which have difficulty in having enough inspectors/advisers will be able to employ them and have them trained <e>", "<cs> my lords moving from wales to scotland may i ask about another suggested marine nature reserve off the isles of scilly <e> <s> it was waiting for an environmental trust to be established <e> <s> has that happened and will designation therefore come rather more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to congratulate the noble lord on his

giving them computers and other items of equipment which would help with information technology <e> <s> firms very often have spare items of equipment which are perhaps not quite modern enough for them but which would certainly be useful for primary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an unexpected reply but is the minister aware that when the advisory committee on the supply and education of teachers was allowed to lapse by sir keith joseph as he then was in it was suggested that it could be reconvened two years later <e> <s> since five years later the committees projections with regard to teacher supply have come all too true would it not be sensible to establish a similar committee which could determine the facts in a professional manner to ensure that well-informed decisions were made in good time and to reconcile competing analyses about the true extent of teacher shortage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is not just a question of finding out what the position is now but also a question of planning ahead <e> <s> does he agree that we need to be able to plan future intakes of students for initial training and that one needs to look a great many years ahead for that purpose <e> <s> that is what the des seems to have failed abysmally to do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the departments own projections for the interim advisory committee on school teachers pay and conditions showed appalling shortages for <e> <s> might that have been avoided had action been taken sooner <e>", "<cs> my lords are the minister and the house aware that only per cent <e> <s> of the pupils in nottinghamshire county schools can get into the eleventh session workshop and that there is a very long waiting list of pupils from county schools <e> <s> is it therefore fair that they should not get in and pupils from the ctcs whose parents have decided that they should opt out of the system should go instead <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the sum of he mentioned which is being contributed by the des still leaves a gap in funds amounting to about <e> <s> is he also aware that it is not yet certain whether the london borough grants committee can meet the difference because it does not know whether it will receive the per cent <e> <s> increase that it requires <e> <s> is he further aware that a great many voluntary bodies which ilea supported for example centrepoint soho to which it gave new horizon youth centre to which it gave and the piccadilly advice centre to which it gave are at risk <e> <s> are not the government concerned that such organisations may have to close <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i consider his responses poor and as showing a great lack of imagination and care about what is to happen after the ilea is abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is no doubt well aware i do not find that a very satisfactory answer <e> <s> does he realise that universities spend infinitely less than they did in the equivalent terms of and that the figures for university spending on books and journals are down by per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively since then and that the figures for polytechnics are much worse <e> <s> if the government are serious about supporting international literacy year i should have thought that to encourage spending on books for universities where after all students are pretty hard pressed for spending on books should be a major preoccupation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that students in this country spend very much less on books than do students in other european countries <e>", "<cs> i too have put my name to the amendment <e> <s> i appreciate what noble and learned lords have said about judicial review <e> <s> i understand what it is <e> <s> it is not an appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the evidence from the countryside commission is that large areas are being lost and are at risk that applications are being submitted for areas as large as acres to be deregulated and that there might be development <e> <s> who are the other interested parties causing the hold-up <e>",

local government and housing act which in sections to and schedule provides for a political balance on local authority committees and other bodies will apply to the governing bodies of schools <e>",

how will the government cope with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first staff members seconded to the school by member states other than the united kingdom are exempt from income tax in respect of salaries and emoluments paid to them by the school <e> <s> we understand that a good many teachers come from member states to teach in our schools <e>

minister aware that the des forecast a shortfall of chemistry teachers by <e> <s> further has this prediction been updated <e> <s> moreover as the noble baroness lady platt of writtle mentioned the royal society of chemistry is she also aware that the society is still not satisfied with the position and that it is hoping that the des will fund certain in-service training initiatives involving the open university <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether such training will be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the des has reviewed the effectiveness of the bursary scheme <e> <s> i ask that question because initially a number of students changed over to the scheme in order to receive the tax free allowance and thereafter the intake dropped slightly <e> <s> further is there any proposal for review as there are other shortage subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to talk about adult education concentrating rather more on the importance of education for its effect on society than on the economy although the two are inextricably interwoven <e> <s> adult education can contribute to the whole of life but it is a matter which the government seem to care very little about and indeed not to understand <e> <s> i too wish to speak about the wea and to show how the governments action towards that association and the extra-mural boards is typical of the department trying to hive off its responsibilities to the local authorities on the one hand and the universities and the ufc on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we are pleased that there will be greater flexibility as we had all expected <e> <s> we gather that there is a certain amount of trouble in getting teachers to agree to do all the assessment and examining that will be necessary in all key stages and that they will be thoroughly exhausted by the time they reach key stage <e> <s> perhaps i may say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask that when the noble baroness has had time to read the chief inspectors report she will add her voice to the need for greater flexibility still and for a little less assessment which takes up the time of teachers who are much needed for other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords when will the report of the history working group be published <e> <s> it seems to have been delayed for a considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us the position of a couple now on income support <e> <s> as the poll tax is supposed to be for individuals will each individual receive the per cent <e> <s> rebate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ask the government to encourage the des to be family friendly and produce some finance so that lea employees can use crche facilities in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister

encourages teachers in most schools <e> <s> we have had a very bad report from the hmi on the state of school buildings <e> <s> can the minister say whether the financial provision i have described encourages the morale of teachers and students in every other kind of school <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> do the government propose to monitor the introduction of the provisions in the education reform act relating to religious education and collective worship <e> <s> do they also propose to monitor the decisions of the standing advisory councils on religious education <e> <s> they have the right under section of the act to exempt county schools from observing those provisions if they think it appropriate to do so <e> <s> have there been any exemptions and

hoped that the noble viscount would already have jumped to his feet and said we agree with this because there are precedents <e> <s> there is the amenity duty which was put into schedule to the housing and planning act <e> <s> precedents have also been set in the electricity act <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to follow the rather strange speech of my noble friend lord annan <e> <s> i wonder whether he made the speech that he intended to make when he came to the house <e> <s> possibly he has been influenced by some of the comments that have been made about the bill by almost every other speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my pleasure to the fact that the government have decided to accept the decision of the committee last week that the substance of the amendment which was passed by as the noble lord said a considerable majority should be accepted and the worth of it understood <e> <s> i am grateful as i am sure the noble lord lord norrie and the noble baroness lady stedman will be for the opportunity to meet the minister so that the matter could be thrashed out <e>", "<cs> i have added my name to the amendment together with those of liberal members <e> <s> i should like to take up several of the points raised by the noble viscount <e> <s> i do not believe that students are longing for the bill at all <e> <s> we have received letters from many undergraduate students at polytechnics and universities and they show a good deal of hostility towards the bill <e> <s> it would be different if they were to receive more money as a result but as was pointed out by the noble lord lord walton many will be much worse off having lost housing benefit and income support during the long vacation <e>", "<cs> i add my support to the many voices which have spoken in favour of helping part-time students <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beloff said the bill is to provide for the making of loans to students towards their maintenance in higher education <e> <s> the noble lord suggested one way round this and i am quite sure that if the noble earl is feeling kindly he will be able to think of some way in which part-time students could be helped <e>", "<cs> we are a little clearer and i take it that my amendment is not acceptable <e> <s> however i do not believe that the noble earl said that in so many words <e> <s> it is odd that the government have persisted in referring to top-up loans in all the recent literature that is the february leaflet and the rules and procedures document which we received the day before second reading <e> <s> for that reason we were a little mystified and decided to table this simple amendment in order to clear the air <e> <s> i believe that it has and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord renton the present maintenance grant for students is supposed to cover items like books <e> <s> so why should this maintenance grant be expected not to do that <e>", "<cs> i must make an apology to the committee <e> <s> although i said that i was speaking to two amendments i did not name the second amendment <e> <s> it was amendment no <e> <s> which states <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply although i cannot say that it pleased me very much <e> <s> i do not quite understand the argument that because mature students already have debts they will want to involve themselves in more <e> <s> i do not believe that that follows at all <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> the need for child-care facilities is beginning to be recognised more and more readily <e> <s> i have an interesting list of the various universities and colleges which provide help in this way <e> <s> it is also interesting to see how expensive such provision is in a good many cases <e> <s> a joint college nursery for staff and students was set up at cambridge university in the s <e> <s> it has now been almost entirely taken over by the staff <e> <s> the students have been pushed out <e>", "<cs> i am delighted and i must confess even slightly surprised <e> <s> it is not very often that the government agree to an amendment <e> <s> i thank the noble earl very much and agree to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i look forward to that of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for what i think is an encouraging response that these courses are probably covered under those paragraphs under schedule <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the noble baroness has said and consult <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what has been said by the noble baroness lady seear and also the remarks of the noble baroness lady young about access funds which will clearly be totally inadequate to make up for the loss of housing benefit <e> <s> whether or not we like social security to be mixed up with education and the funding of students it has happened <e> <s> the allowances are being taken away and that will make a great deal of difference to many students <e>", "<cs> i referred to applications and not to students studying in london now <e>", "<cs> the minister said that he did not have certain figures <e> <s> i have some figures from <e>", "<cs> i should like to support these amendments <e> <s> my name is to the first two and it would have been to the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson if there had been room to put it on <e> <s> unfortunately it was a competition to put names to that amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> of course we are very pleased to hear about the increased grants <e> <s> however will they be administered by the local authorities <e> <s> i ask this because apparently in some cases authorities have not been very generous in this respect up until now <e> <s> further will the grants be paid in advance of the academic year rather than in arrears as is sometimes the case at present <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept all that the noble baroness says <e> <s> she seems to think that it is a persons choice whether or not he defers <e> <s> it really depends on the sort of a job a person can get <e> <s> the fact is that people who defer will be paying more in the long run than if they had not been able to defer <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment which has had strong support <e> <s> the only voice that defended the government was that of the noble baroness lady young who often comes to the rescue of her front bench when she sees it in difficulty <e> <s> her points were based on the average student <e> <s> a total of per cent <e> <s> of students live in the private rented sector <e> <s> there is no doubt that they will be worse off <e>", "<cs> i have found another figure which i shall quote <e> <s> it is a government figure which shows that over per cent <e> <s> of undergraduate students have claimed welfare benefits some receiving sums well in excess of the proposed top-up loans those benefits will no longer be available <e> <s> if a similar proportion to per cent <e> <s> seek assistance from the access fund it will provide only an average of per student per annum <e> <s> i do not think we have had a satisfactory answer and as there is a great deal of anxiety on all sides all i can do is test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply but he did not answer two specific questions could the company be sold and could it be sold to an overseas company <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am altogether satisfied with that last reply <e> <s> i should like to think about it and consider whether we should come back with a slightly different amendment at report stage <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is an unsatisfactory reply <e> <s> the noble baroness has gone at great length into many matters which do not have much to do with my amendment <e> <s> she again makes the point that there will be monitoring <e> <s> i think it odd that the amendment cannot be accepted <e> <s> i shall not press it at this time of night but it is likely that i shall return to the matter at the next stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the government may have tabled the amendment on thursday but it was not printed until friday when many noble lords were not in the house <e> <s> surely it is possible there is a precedent for this for these amendments concerning the consumer credit act to be recommitted and taken at a later stage when we have had a chance to study them <e> <s> if the amendment were recommitted we could continue with the other amendments today at report stage <e> <s> as my noble friend said we shall then have the chance of a much freer discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank all those who supported the amendment <e> <s> i was glad that the noble baroness lady young quoted the passage from the white paper on monitoring and that the noble baroness lady blatch responded to the very good point made by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> however i am sorry that the noble baroness lady elles objected to women coming in in fifth position <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word about speech therapists who have hardly been mentioned <e> <s> they are very necessary and are in very short supply they are also low paid <e> <s> the courses run to four years <e> <s> the starting pay has just gone up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those noble lords who supported my amendment <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord renton decided to think again about his attitude towards mature students <e> <s> i am also grateful for his concern for students over the age of years <e> <s> of course the governments response is not as satisfactory as i would have hoped <e> <s> however i am glad for the reassurance about the uprating of the allowance and about the two homes allowance <e> <s> i believe i understood the noble baroness correctly on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the questions asked by the noble baroness lady elles have been answered by my noble friend lady blackstone and by the minister to the effect that it is all right to have part-time students in the bill <e> <s> there is no commitment to expenditure in my amendment <e> <s> it simply asks that part-time students be mentioned in the bill and that consideration be given to them in a years time <e> <s> the minister said that there is nothing to stop consideration being given but we should like it to be a positive demand that part-time students should be considered in a years time <e> <s> a figure of between million and million was mentioned as the amount that would be needed if a loan of was given but it does not seem to be such a colossal sum when one considers some government expenditure <e> <s> in view of the support for part-time students i believe that i should test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that full reply <e> <s> i admit that my amendment was tabled well before his <e> <s> however i think it has been helpful to clarify the situation <e> <s> i am grateful for his explanation <e> <s> i shall of course read his words with great interest to make sure that all my points have been cleared up <e> <s> certainly at this moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one point which i do not think was made by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> i apologise if i did not hear him but there was rather a buzz of conversation at the beginning of his remarks <e> <s> during the committee stage of the bill on th march the noble earl lord caithness announced that income from disability benefits that is mobility and attendance allowances would be disregarded for the purposes of assessing an individuals eligibility for deferment <e> <s> but since those benefits had always previously been disregarded for tax purposes or for assessing other means tested benefits that announcement did not constitute a concession <e> <s> nor did it address the problem of the lower disposable incomes and the higher likely loan debts of disabled students <e> <s> i hope that that point will be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may put one or two questions to him <e> <s> he said that what is proposed is not an entirely new idea but of course the grants are being dealt with by the local authorities <e> <s> therefore the loans scheme is new to the institutions <e> <s> i was also rather alarmed when he said that a student would be able to apply for a loan when he got to his college or university <e> <s> when will he actually receive the money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> we said that we did not want amendment no <e> <s> to be grouped with these amendments it does not go with them <e> <s> perhaps it would be better if it were dealt with separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for replying to the amendment <e> <s> however it seems to me odd if the government really have confidence that the company will work that they cannot accept putting its name on the face of the bill <e> <s> it is odd that such an integral part of the whole scheme should not appear in the bill at all <e> <s> however i shall read what the noble baroness said and consider whether i shall need to return to this matter at the next and final stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer but i am sorry that he will not agree to the statement in the way that we want it <e> <s> i see what will happen there will be a great many written questions teasing out the information bit by bit <e> <s> it would have been much simpler if we could have had it as the amendment asks <e> <s> however i shall read commons <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask one question <e> <s> will the under-s have to have a guarantor <e> <s> i understand that when under-s borrow from banks they have to have a guarantor <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> however is she aware that many people in education are most concerned about the effects of the present policy particularly in relation to modern languages <e> <s> evidence from head teachers and modern linguists to the ec sub-committee on the teaching of foreign languages say that there has been a great reduction in activity by wy of visits and exchanges <e> <s> i hope that the monitoring will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied with that figure which does not appear to show much enthusiasm for the scheme <e> <s> is the minister aware that i tabled the question because the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for this concession <e> <s> it has taken a long time to get but it has arrived <e> <s> we are very pleased about it <e> <s> the noble baroness lady young said how pleased the universities would be <e> <s> i would say that the universities the polytechnics and indeed the colleges which are affected by schedule will be glad to have the reassurance that the amendment gives <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment as i did on report <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson has made the necessary points and there is no need for me to repeat them <e> <s> i hope that disabled students will receive the extra help <e> <s> we all agree that what has been given is generous but because of the difficulties that they will face when repaying the loans that is not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask whether the meeting for tuesday is absolutely fixed or will it take place only if the bill has received royal assent by then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i am not at all surprised that the amendment is defective <e> <s> the point about the further education sector was an oversight <e> <s> however i am glad that institutions will have discretion in this matter because they will have different needs <e> <s> i am glad also that the operation will be monitored <e> <s> nevertheless i am disappointed as regards what the noble baroness said about loans because i thought these access funds were to be outright grants <e> <s> if they are to be granted as loans they will represent yet another burden on the students concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that under the grant-maintained schools finance regulations grant-maintained schools are likely to receive to per cent <e> <s> more in financial terms than if they had remained lea maintained schools under local financial management <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government agree that taking grant-maintained status lifts the dead hand of a local education authority from the life of a school a statement with which the secretary of state for education said in the other place he agreed <e> <s> that seems a very unfortunate thing for him to have said <e>", "<cs> my lords among the many matters which apparently the government are considering during the long pause in the discussions we have now been waiting for three months are they considering financing teachers salaries other than through the revenue support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that when there have been strikes the teachers have taken great care that they do not interfere with the lessons that the children should have <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this short debate though there were not many speakers <e> <s> the quality of the debate has been good and each individual had his or her own contribution to make <e> <s> it is particularly nice o be facing my old opponent the noble earl lord swinton as we have faced each other across the chamber so often <e> <s> i should not imagine that anyone can equal his record as regards the number of governing bodies that he has sat on <e> <s> he certainly would not be allowed to sit on so many governing bodies now as the maximum number that one can sit on is four <e> <s> the noble lord lord ritchie pointed that out <e> <s> however in view of the new responsibilities i should imagine that to sit on four governing bodies is quite sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to the noble lord lord moran for raising this important environmental issue to which i think not nearly enough attention has been paid <e> <s> i hope that this debate will raise awareness <e> <s> i might just repeat one or two of the points made by the noble lord and the noble earl <e> <s> i apologise if i do but i believe that they are important and could well be re-emphasised <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past the government have given undertakings that if a management agreement has been made the funds will be available <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether that undertaking will be honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the last sentiment because remembering the wildlife and countryside bill i am sure that the noble earl is right <e> <s> its passage was a mammoth exercise as i expect this bills will be <e>", "<cs> i had intended that my name should be added to those putting forward the amendment <e> <s> i very warmly support the noble baroness because there is a strong case that deaf students should be looked on in the same way as other disabled students <e> <s> there is a difficulty with regard to definition and that will perhaps need to be discussed <e> <s> we need a far better definition than the one which goes back to <e> <s> the important point is that the amendment is not asking for help with educational matters such as extra equipment and so on <e> <s> we know that grants have been allowed and we are very grateful for those under the education student loans bill <e> <s> these amendments refer to help and maintenance <e>", "<cs> i know about the grant for equipment to help disabled students <e> <s> however if they take longer over their work and even if they have that kind of support they still have not time to do odd jobs which can create the money to help with their maintenance <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> however she still ignores the evidence that has been collected about the way in which students will be worse off when the situation develops as it will next year <e>", "<cs> my disbelief on this amendment is just as great as it was on the previous amendments <e> <s> i do not believe that the government have their figures right and i shall again divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> however i feel the same about that as did the noble earl lord russell about the reply to his amendment <e> <s> so many of these issues were talked about such as the child benefit extension <e> <s> that lasts only for a limited period of or weeks <e> <s> the bridging loan is and it lasts for eight weeks only during a -week period <e> <s> between september and january there were applications for severe hardship payments and one-third of those over were refused <e> <s> therefore these provisions are not absolute panaceas <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which was so ably and fully moved by the noble earl <e> <s> it seems extremely unfair that pregnant and year-olds should be treated differently from year-olds <e> <s> their problems are just as great if not greater <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned the cost of the amendment and said that it could not be costed <e> <s> one hopes that there will be few cases <e> <s> as he said family planning could help with that <e> <s> the allowance would be paid only if or year-olds were removed from yts or were unable to obtain a yts place or a job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to speak after the noble baroness <e> <s> in view of some of the things that she said i believe that she will support some of the points that i shall make <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that if a local education authoritys plans for reorganisation are totally put out if grant maintained status for a school is approved that rather naturally means that it is not pleased <e> <s> does she realise that in the case of the beechen cliff school in avon to which the secretary of state has just given permission for grant maintained status individuals and school governing bodies including many primary schools objected <e> <s> is that not rather a lot of parents who want a different outcome <e> <s> does the minister agree that after the beechen cliff decision decisions for grant maintained status depend entirely on the caprice of the secretary of state and nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that all the money that is held centrally by leas has been approved by the department of education <e> <s> every local authority has to submit its plans for funding schools and the amount that is held back is approved by the department of education <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment has great similarities with amendment no <e> <s> in the names of the noble baroness lady faithfull the noble earl lord russell and myself <e> <s> the minister will know what i feel about amendment no <e> <s> for all the reasons already given <e> <s> i too support amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully support the amendment which stands in my name also <e> <s> the noble earl has moved it so admirably that there is little left for me to say <e> <s> those who have brought up people of this age group know that they cost as much as those over in the amount they eat what they wear the space that they take up and so on <e> <s> i endorse the noble earls other point <e> <s> although there are moments when parents and children long to be apart the perverse incentive is not there <e> <s> i warmly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down could she answer one question <e> <s> do the government expect students to work in the long vacation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that an answer <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can try again <e> <s> i do not believe that that is at all a satisfactory answer <e> <s> we heard the old arguments over and over again while we were going through the student loans bill and now we hear them on the social security bill <e> <s> we clearly do not agree about the expenditure and what the student will have to live on whether or not it will be adequate <e> <s> we believe that it will be inadequate <e> <s> some students will not have enough to live on if they cannot get work in the summer vacation without becoming dependent on their parents <e> <s> some parents may not be able to support them <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments deal with two different matters <e> <s> one deals with contributions from national insurance funds whereas the other deals with the matter of being available for work <e> <s> i should say to the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter that i understood that amendment no <e> <s> represents the technical way of dealing with the matter and that the wording is directly related to that of dss draft regulations and the way the government wish to withdraw the unemployment benefit <e> <s> i am not an expert on drafting amendments but i was assured that what i had stated in the amendment would achieve what i had intended <e> <s> i hope i am correct on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not satisfied <e> <s> there is a moral problem here and a breach of natural justice <e> <s> i shall divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed with that answer as i am sure the noble baroness lady faithfull will be too <e> <s> mrs shephard kindly gave me the letter which was written to the noble lord lord joseph about the many things which have been done as a result of the governments misguided plan to remove benefit as from september <e> <s> they have had to make a number of changes because the policy was so misguided <e> <s> i am sorry to say that they do not realise that it is still misguided <e> <s> the amendment does not ask for undiluted help until the age of it asks for help until those people concerned obtain a youth training place or employment <e> <s> it does not go as far as the minister suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> although the overall figures may sustain what she says is it not a fact that it is the quality of those leaving that causes concern <e> <s> every year since more readers and senior lecturers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help the noble baroness <e> <s> the official figures which i have show that there has been a net outflow of senior lecturers in the past nine years <e> <s> i shall have great pleasure in showing the noble baroness those figures later <e> <s> is it not another cause for anxiety that a number of postdoctoral and senior research members of university teams are leaving <e> <s> that is especially worrying as regards a lack of staff in the future in the departments that they are leaving <e> <s> is not that departure the result not only of less money but also of fewer facilities fewer opportunities and less money for research here whereas in the united states and canada there are far better facilities and much more money is available for research <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that we must have different figures <e> <s> i shall have great pleasure in consulting the noble baroness afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that water extraction is clearly affecting the habitats and therefore survival of some uncommon plants <e> <s> my

reply because the government have already added religious and childrens broadcasting to the list <e> <s> the minister said repeatedly that we shall have the same sort of programmes as before <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bonham-carter said the act provides for television and local sound broadcasting services as a public service for disseminating information education and entertainment <e>", "<cs> i am dividing on the group of amendments <e> <s> if the minister does not care for amendment noa if it is carried he can change it at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i understood it happened previously when i moved a group of amendments that if the amendment upon which we are voting is carried i move the other amendments when we come to them and they are carried automatically <e> <s> i am glad that the minister agrees with that <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of these amendments <e> <s> the provision is important because if the programmes are not shown at appropriate times then unless the schools have videos they will be in difficulty <e> <s> we all know that at the moment schools are short of cash for books equipment and so on <e> <s> some schools may well have difficulty in providing sufficient videos tapes and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that housing associations are not capable of performing as well as they would like because of the money that is being cut off this year <e> <s> even if they did all they could it would still not be enough to satisfy the need for houses that now exists <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that he is a little too self-satisfied about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure because the minister spoke so fast whether the erasmus scheme is being used in russia and eastern europe <e> <s> can she clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely interesting short debate <e> <s> it has been informative and i have learned much from it <e> <s> in fact i am rather ashamed about that because my name is on the amendment but i have learned a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> i am entirely in agreement <e> <s> the objectives are the same <e> <s> i believe i said that both the association of county councils and the association of metropolitan authorities are quite content that this clause should be in the bill <e> <s> however they wanted some reassurance that they would be treated with consideration <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite reasonable <e> <s> surely both local and central government should want to get on with and consider each other <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with her colleague mr walden recently a minister of the des who said in the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could come back and ask the minister as government spokesman whether or not she agrees that we need to take radical action to deal with the problem of teacher quality and that we shall achieve nothing in regard to teacher quality unless there is a substantial increase in teachers pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the money already spent on reorganisation came out of the existing budget for this year <e> <s> in that case is that not a loss to the amount that would otherwise be available for conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are delighted to hear that next week we shall receive some figures and more information than we have previously had which we certainly deserve <e> <s> however if the noble baroness goes back on that assurance there will be real trouble <e> <s> we know perfectly well that reports have been made <e> <s> figures are available and they should be made available to us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that japan has supercomputer centres the united states has germany has nine and that france and germany have an academic computing power which is almost double that of britain <e> <s> therefore does he accept that this is not the right moment to reduce the services of one of our few computing centres <e> <s> we do not want its work to be reduced but to be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> stands in my name too <e> <s> i wish to refer specifically to an area of broadcasting not named in the bill <e> <s> that is student radio <e> <s> there are at present student radio stations operating in universities and polytechnics around the country <e> <s> they broadcast using an induction-looped system at low power covering small areas of a campus such as a hall of residence and various blocks <e> <s> most of the broadcasting is on the medium wave am system although some stations have experimented with fm through special licences <e> <s> the stations play music and also have various news and discussion programmes <e> <s> for their income most rely on a mixture of advertising revenues and grants from student unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one comment to the noble baroness <e> <s> last thursday i asked a question involving the resources for the ncc <e> <s> the minister said that we would be told something this week <e> <s> i believe that it was most extraordinary that she did not say at that moment that the consultants reports would be in the library for us to see <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister appears to be jumping to her feet but i have an amendment in this group to which i have not yet had the chance to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it therefore that this is my opportunity to speak <e> <s> i intend to speak to amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> however i should like to say first that as one who has been involved ever since the bill came to this house in asking questions about the funding and resources and when we would hear about such matters i entirely agree with all that has been said by my noble friend by the noble lord lord ross and by the noble baroness lady robson <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is attached to this amendment because it seems to me to be a sensible precaution <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not have thought that either of these amendments would deal with that situation <e> <s> my name is added to the amendment which deals with the neglect of sssis although i must confess that i meant to add my name to the other amendment too <e> <s> i support both of the amendments <e> <s> something needs to be done to close the loopholes that exist <e> <s> i hope the minister agrees with that <e> <s> she may ask where the money will come from if the councils have to put right any damage <e> <s> however i should point out that a lot of voluntary bodies operate in this area <e> <s> one only has to think of the noble lord lord norrie and the british trust for conservation volunteers <e> <s> that is the kind of body which would be willing to remove scrub and carry out other such tasks <e> <s> i hope that in future more offenders will do community service instead of going to prison and that would be a very good task for them to turn their hands to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it would be more satisfactory if i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> a which is grouped with this amendment <e> <s> the bill currently requires that where a national nature reserve or sssi lies partly in one country and partly in another it shall be considered to be two separate sites <e> <s> the council in whose area each part lies is responsible for exercising all relevant functions <e> <s> the amendment requires each council to consult the other before exercising any of its functions and enables the councils to exercise their functions jointly <e>", "<cs> my lords the wish to protect the quality threshold in the bill has been expressed by a great many people including the government during our discussions at all stages <e> <s> therefore the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale lord norrie lord plowden and i were delighted when our amendments to protect documentaries education and social action programmes and to ensure that those programmes were shown at high viewing times were passed by the large majority of with all-party support in committee <e> <s> no one except the minister spoke against them <e>", "<cs> my lords my hostility to part vii of the bill is well known <e> <s> i shall not go over that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the secretary of state is doing something positive <e> <s> however will the government dissociate themselves from the report <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord does not mind my interrupting these amendments were carried for channel and channel at committee stage <e> <s> they have not been turned down by this house at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to all those who have spoken in the debate indeed many more have spoken in favour of my motion than against it <e> <s> we heard very much the same old arguments <e> <s> i believe that i rebutted them in my original speech <e> <s> the arguments put forward in the course of the debate were very well rebutted by the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomson made the very important point that the other place is not very firm in its dislike of these amendments <e> <s> after all our intention was just to add to a list which had already been started and added to by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the latest advice from the government goes right back to <e> <s> i refer to the administrative memorandum <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> surely the need for reform has been brought forward not only since higginson in a report which the government turned down but by the committee of vice-chancellors and principals by the school examinations and assessment council the national curriculum council and her majestys inspectorate <e> <s> therefore does the noble baroness agree with professor pring of oxford university that before reform of examinations at it would have been more sensible to reform the whole provision of education at as the staying on rate is so very poor in this country <e> <s> it would have been wiser to do that before the reform of a-levels <e> <s> is the whole provision being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many eligible primary schools that is those with more than pupils have asked to become grant-maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that she is referring to secondary schools whereas the question refers to primary schools <e> <s> i understand from what she said that no primary school has achieved grant-maintained status as yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall turn to a quite different subject adult and community education <e> <s> this is a time when provision for the education of adults in britain is being materially affected by a combination of demographic industrial legislative and institutional changes <e> <s> opportunities for adult learners are being seriously reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that many children are not in the ctc schools and that a great deal of money needs to be spent on the schools attended by the majority of pupils <e> <s> does she also realise that those schools are crumbling <e> <s> it seems most unfair to many people that an excessive amount of money is being spent on ctcs in proportion to the amount spent on the maintenance of maintained schools <e>"]
