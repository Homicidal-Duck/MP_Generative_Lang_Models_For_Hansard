and from the need to introduce at least two major amendments in policy in a bill which has already reached committee stage in another place <e> <s> that this is a bill which has been quite inadequately considered by the government and that they are in as much a state of confusion as we all are as is shown by this unintelligible statement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that my noble friend lord kilmarnock asked him whether it was the case that the aid programme is falling in real terms to which he replied that my noble friend had overlooked the fact that the aid programme for the coming year was rising by million <e> <s> would the minister be good enough to check his figures and say whether in fact the programme is rising by million in real terms as the

of what a useful step the government have taken in encouraging economic activity by this particular method of pump priming which the minister concentrated on and very rightly <e> <s> may i ask two questions <e> <s> first of all in order to give us some idea of what proportion of the schemes has been approved and what proportion has been disapproved can he tell us the total value of the schemes

my lords the second question that i was asking the noble lord was whether he could tell us what proportion of the total amount voted under this heading for these purposes has now been appropriated under this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords now that it has become and is becoming ever clearer that the governments stance on incomes policy is not proving effective may i echoing largely what the noble lord lord rochester said ask the minister when the government are proposing to bring forward a scheme or series of proposals to this house which will aim at enabling groups of workers to have their comparative remuneration judged in relation to all other groups of workers at one time and not <e>", "<cs> my lords since so many of your lordships have already spoken on the essence of the motion and bearing in mind that there is great pressure on time i shall limit my comments to what is essentially the duty of the government to give full information on figures relating to student fees

noble lord was himself a minister it was his habit to give full information and when that information is asked for it is the duty of the government to provide it <e> <s> the specific point that the noble lord is making is totally irrelevant it is taken into account in both sets of figures and what we are talking about is a trend a comparison <e> <s> when there is a trend that is going down i do not think that it is helpful for a minister to give replies which indicate to anybody who does not know the true facts that the trend is going up <e> <s> i think that it is as simple as that and i regret very much that i have found it necessary to make this speech <e> <s> i repeat the noble lord lord belstead is always courteous and i hope that in future he will always be as candid and as frank

opportunity of debating it at a time when it is absolutely necessary and appropriate <e> <s> i want to offer him the thanks of your lordships house for so doing <e> <s> i also want to tell him that i agree with every word of the motion and that if it is to be carried to a division then we on these benches shall certainly be supporting him <e> <s> as he did i shall try to be as moderate in my

the present government it is my duty to lay before your lordships such experience as i have to endeavour as the noble lord lord cockfield has said to diagnose correctly and to propose the right remedy <e>", "<cs> before the matter is disposed of my lords i wish to refer once more to the question of a member of the cabinet because the minister said he would look into it <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that when moving the amendment he used the term minister of cabinet rank and i think he will find that it is possible to be a minister of that rank without being a member of the cabinet which is the term used in the amendment <e> <s> in looking into the matter in order to get it completely clear the minister will no doubt look into the wording of the amendment and not the wording of his speech in which he introduced it which if i am right he quite understandably used that term <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will be glad to know that in the proposals made by the alliance at the recent general election we put forward a scheme which would go so far as is practicable and possible to meet the difficulties which he himself has so well illustrated <e> <s> he will appeciate from the fact that the scheme which his own government proposed nearly years ago has not been implemented that there are many practical difficulties which are well understood in your lordships house if we are to provide a net below which those on very low incomes cannot fall <e> <s> nevertheless we attempted this and much more in the proposals which we made <e>", "<cs> my lords are the figures the noble lord gives in real terms or in cash terms <e> <s> would he be good enough on every occasion in future as we have had this difficulty with him in the past to make it clear to the house what information he is giving to your lordships lest the house be misled by his answers <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the statement which the government have made in which it is made clear that it is necessary to reduce likely expenditure by over million in order to get it back on the intended path make it clear that expenditure under this government is totally out of control and that the government are guilty of complete mismanagement of the funds that parliament has voted <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is to continue to use a great deal of discretion then the business community will not know where it stands <e> <s> is it not in the best interests of all the companies concerned that they should be able to judge on the basis of past experience what is likely to happen in their individual cases <e> <s> would the minister consider following the precedent of the inland revenue where if there is a similar possibility of considerable delay in a decision on tax liablity affecting a proposal which might otherwise not be pursued then as the minister is very fully aware under certain circumstances the inland revenue are prepared to give information in advance so that the proposal can either be followed or otherwise <e> <s> would the minister consider whether that might not help the business community which we are all committed to assist if we can <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that all of us on these benches would support the government to the utmost i repeat to the utmost in their pursuit of the avoidance of protectionism especially when or should i say even though <e> <s> the country involved is the united states and is our close ally having regard to the fact that the united states so recently expressed its determination to do exactly that <e>

the policy expressed so recently by its own government <e> <s> has the noble baroness any explanation to give us from the united states as to this extraordinary conduct <e> <s> since i regard this as so much more important than the other matters that are disclosed in the statement i will limit my questions to that single point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in two ways <e> <s> first because he has enabled your lordships house to discuss this report and secondly because he has made me read it much more thoroughly than i should otherwise have done <e> <s> i am bound to say to the noble lord that i find it a much more acceptable report than he does <e> <s> i am impressed by and agree with the general thrust of the report <e> <s> there is one underlying principle which i know that the noble lord shares but which he did not express namely that the whole of our tax paying and collecting system depends on public goodwill <e> <s> the public goodwill will not be there if an increasingly large proportion of the public particularly those who pay tax at source under pay-as-you-earn feel that they are bearing a disproportionate share of the tax burden that we all need to share because so many others are getting away with it in other respects and in other fields <e> <s> the noble lord referred to small businesses there may be others <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i rise to assure the noble lord in response to the last sentence of the statement that he can rely upon the full support of this section of your lordships house as well in the line which the government are taking <e> <s> is he aware that his further explanation in reply to the question of the noble lord lord bruce of what the government intend is fully acceptable <e> <s> on that same note may i ask what is meant by the words in the statement that appropriate steps to ensure the united kingdom receive an agreed settlement will be taken <e> <s> appropriate steps may mean appropriate in the view of the government or appropriate in the view of other parties to this argument <e> <s> would the noble lord tell us what these appropriate steps are <e> <s> i do not hide from him the hope that his answer on this will be as satisfactory as the answer he gave to the noble lord lord bruce <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i rose at pecisely the same time as the noble lord lord tordoff to ask precisely the same question knowing that the noble lord the minister would not be able to answer it but i still propose to pursue it because it is quite impossible to deal with a matter so serious as this on the basis of question and answer on a government statement <e> <s> we are most grateful to the minister for making the statement <e> <s> it is highly appropriate

more than two views <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may beg your lordships pardon for seeking to take up your time for a very short period notwithstanding that my name is not on the list of speakers and in the hope that having regard to the length of the list that is to say only one noble lord apart from the minister who introduced the bill you will be willing that this discourtous intrusion should he made <e> <s> i should like to apologise for this and to explain the only why my name or the name of one of my noble friends on the liberal front bench was not on the list <e> <s>

deserved tributes paid to sir peter henderson <e> <s> there is little one can add having regard to what has been said <e> <s> i would just say how extraordinary i have found it in the years in which i have been privileged to be a member of your lordships house that on every occasion when one sought his help it was always made available and at very short notice <e> <s> his advice was as constructive

massive intellectual powers we have learned to respect and whose modesty of demeanour we regard with affection <e> <s> we wish him well we wish his lady well and we shall not forget the great help and the great integrity with which he has served your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that he has succeeded in doing nothing other than cause maximum confusion as a result of the various statements which he has been making on behalf of the government as regards public expenditure and cash limits <e> <s> it has become quite impossible to understand why the noble lord on behalf of the government insists that public expenditure is not being cut back and that all that is being cut back are the payments we make which form the body of public expenditure <e> <s> it is quite impossible to understand what the logic is behind the noble lords statement <e> <s> surely when public expenditure was agreed originally and published in the white paper to which reference has been made that public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the chief whip should wait until the end of the sentence <e> <s> i am asking a question in a very familiar form <e> <s> he should realise that a most important statement has been made with totally inadequate time to consider it <e> <s> we have been given a great wadge of figures which no one can possibly comprehend in time at a time when there are no chief secretaries left in the other place to argue adequately on behalf of the oppostition against what the government are doing <e> <s> in all these circumstances and with no promise of a debate it is inevitable that one should seek clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for telling us what is happening about public expenditure in the current year <e> <s> can he confirm that there was a general election on th june and is he aware that the chancellor of the exchequer made a statement on public expenditure in another place exactly four weeks later <e> <s> is he further aware that during the course of that statement he explained that information about public expenditure came in regularly week by week or day by day and that the trouble about public expenditure overshooting its mark arose in the last three months of the last financial year and in the first three months of this financial year that is to say in the first six months of this calendar year <e> <s> is it not obvious that information was available to the government before polling day just as much as it was available after polling day and that the government can therefore be properly charged with a lack of good faith in not telling the electors the full position about public expenditure and indeed about the national health service before polling day <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister absolutely right in saying that now is not the time to be drawn into a general debate on public expenditure <e> <s> therefore would it not follow from that that in order to enable the house to discuss these matters fully and to enable the government to defend their good faith and they were under attack from wide sections of the population for bad faith during the general election he should discuss with his friends the possibility of time being provided by the government for a full debate on these important issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that very full and revealing answer <e> <s> may i welcome him back to the treasury bench as it were in dealing with treasury questions <e> <s> in view of his last remarks has his attention been drawn to a

my lords may i too say how grateful we are it is very important that this should continue to be the case for repeating the statement made in another place thereby enabling this house to participate in important discussions of this kind <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord three questions <e> <s> first approximately i know that he cannot give me a precise figure how much do the government expect to raise net out of this sale <e> <s> secondly is he able to give an assurance that this money being from a sale of national assets will be earmarked exclusively for capital purposes <e> <s> thirdly will he help me with the irreconcilable statements made in the first and second paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the ministers last comment about competitors can he possibly say what the west german figure was for <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us how long the shortfall to which he referred has continued <e> <s> will he explain what the difficulty is about filling it <e>

benefit of their objectivity knowledge and experience <e> <s> i do not believe and i repeat this to the noble lord lord mottistone who has just questioned me that this detracts to any extent from the

consumption purposes such as public services and so on <e> <s> will that continue to be the policy of the government and if it does so continue will not the case be at the end of the governments period of office that the country will simply be the poorer for the lack of all these national assets <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a completely misleading answer <e> <s> the noble lord the minister knows that it has always been the case that out of the proceeds which the government collect a number of items of expenditure have been incurred which could be classified partly as capital and partly as revenue and it has never been the practice to attempt to distinguish <e> <s> is it not the case that there is a great deal of capital loss going on in the form of depreciation which is never recorded in the capital account and which offsets what the minister has been saying <e> <s> am i not right therefore in saying that a clear distinction ought to be drawn when the country is embarking on a totally new policy of selling its birthright <e> <s> the conclusion will be but i do not need to finish it <e>", "<cs> my lords in order that there should be an accurate record in <e>",

housekeeping in the same way as everyone else does by having regard to money coming in from the sale of assets in relation to current spending <e> <s> is it not the case that the minister has once more given us only a partial answer <e> <s> he has not indicated at all what the other side of the capital account is theloss of capital from depreciation and so on which is not shown <e> <s> nor has

lordships and not in the hands of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement has already made it clear that there will be no alteration in the attitude which the noble lord on behalf of the government has already taken up in giving no <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if my recollection is correct the original statement that he read out included on two occasions differences in cash terms which led to a certain conclusion without at the same time giving the figures in real terms which would have led to an opposite conclusion <e> <s> will he please take the greatest care in any statement that he reads out in future to make quite sure that he is giving the house information and not misleading the house as inevitably happens if the cash figures alone are given <e> <s> the second question that i would ask him is what is the justification <e>", "<cs> my lords before i put the second question which i wanted to ask the noble lord may i say in relation to the interruption which the noble lord has just made that every time the government make a misleading statement based on cash terms without giving the real terms in addition i shall get up and seek the leave of the house to draw attention to that practice of misleading the house until it is corrected as it has been broadly corrected in the other house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a second question <e>", "<cs> my lords the second question which i wanted to ask and on which i have been stopped twice is a very short and simple question <e> <s> what is the justification of the government for reducing the proportion of the grant not merely the amount but the proportion of the grant yet again <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be good enough to reconsider his first answer to the noble lord lord mccarthy which suggested that the noble lord and those who thought as he did had had an opportunity which they did not exercise to vote against a substantive motion <e> <s> will the noble earl reconsider that in view of the fact that if he does not he is suggesting to both oppositions that it would be proper for this house to engage in a deliberate constitutional confrontation with the other place on a matter such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the anxiety which has already been expressed in one supplementary question rests mainly on the possibility of a driver being trapped who might not otherwise have been in a situation in which he would have been hurt <e> <s> is it not the case that many of us find moving from one car to another that there is no possibility whatsoever of automatically releasing oneself because so many of the bindings are different <e> <s> should not the investigations which the minister has happily said are taking place concentrate on one single ideal method of automatic release <e>", "<cs> may i very shortly endorse eveything that my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe has said and ask also for some explanation which i think would be appropriately attached to this amendment which relates to the bank of england <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> what the noble and learned lord has just said is surely absolutely right in the sense that though it may be proper we do not think it wise to interfere as an executive in the process of law when it is in the stage mentioned unless there is an overwhelming reason which makes it essential to do <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be acceptable to your lordships committee that i move the amendment standing in the name of my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> he is most anxious to move this amendment and believes that it is important and deserving of the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be a little more forthcoming as to what he means by in due course <e> <s> is not the essence of this matter that everybody has some concern <e> <s> indeed many people believe that they have an indirect interest in the benefit in question <e> <s> is it not right that the government should hurry up with these consultations which are going on between ministers and offer us their conclusions and not merely say in due course <e> <s> as has been said with some considerable authority in due course we shall all be dead <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount for that answer and i take particular notice of the part that he as it were underlined vocally <e> <s> may i start by asking him whether he is aware that as regards his duties as leader of this house we on these benches have nothing but praise for the way in which he carries them out <e> <s> i imagine that that goes for many others of your lordships as well <e> <s> but is there not a danger that the impartiality which he shows in carrying out those important tasks may be in conflict with the partiality which i believe is required to carry out the far less important task of trying to prevent the government from getting a bad press whenever they are doing badly as they are at the moment <e> <s> is it not vital that there should be no confusion between the noble viscount and whitewash <e>", "<cs> my lords if nobody else wishes to intervene may i ask the noble baroness whether she would be good enough perhaps tomorrow to give further thought to the point which my noble friend lord gladwyn raised because those of us who heard her comments can understand how the statement should be interpreted <e> <s> but those who read the statement flat without those comments are much more than likely to come to the conclusion to which my noble friend lord gladwyn and i came by the statement saying that if you do so-and-so you can then move on to something else meaning that if you cannot do so-and-so then you cannot move on to something else <e> <s> the noble baroness has been good enough to explain that that something else could be moved on to indeed is going to be moved on to and it would be helpful therefore to those outside this place who take a great interest in statements of this kind that there should be the opportunity of the statement being published in the press or in some way like that to make quite clear that the interpretation put on this important statement is the one which the noble baroness has expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> may i ask the minister to be good enough to read out the figures at dictation speed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the minister for the trouble he has taken in providing me with these figures <e> <s> may i ask him whether he recollects that in reply to a question asked by the noble baroness lady nicol towards the end of november of last year the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor gave figures indicating a very substantial increase indeed so substantial an increase that no less a person than the leader of her majestys opposition was disposed to call them very impressive figures <e> <s> these figures were given in current cost terms and led the house to believe that there had been a very substantial increase in this expenditure over a period of six years and in particular over the year being inquired into by the questioner <e>", "<cs> the question in case the chief whip has forgotten it is does the noble lord recollect that this happened <e> <s> does the noble lord further recollect that the figures given for the relevant years which were under inquiry by the noble baroness showed an increase of some million <e> <s> on the figures now given by the noble lord the accurate figure is million million as against million <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is is it not in the best interests of this house that ministers should be in a position to give significant comparisons rather than comparisons which lay it open for the members of this house to be misled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she would be kind enough to dwell a little more closely on the question troubling the noble lord who asked the previous question and i am sure many others of your lordships <e> <s> although we well understand the view of the government that this particular department should be brought in line with other intelligence departments what is difficult to understand in the absence of anything which has triggered this off is why a decision should be made so precipitately and so unusually without consultation with the parties involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for repeating the answer to this private notice question of which as the result of the new arrangements none of us in this house had any foreknowledge before the statement was made by the minister <e> <s> the minister will not be surprised to hear me say therefore that i do not propose to ask any further questions of detail which have been so ably put already especially having regard to the fact that the meeting is to take place and has not already taken place <e> <s> i am and i suspect many of your lordships are more concerned with this as evidence of the falling away of attitudes of liberality in trade negotiations which is taking place in the united states france and this country and which should surely be a matter of great concern <e> <s> therefore i ask the minister whether he will not consider whether we should not somewhat change our attitude which is not all that praiseworthy in relation to liberality of trade <e> <s> should we change the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to give a welcome so far as these benches are concerned a very warm welcome to the statement which has been made by the noble lord the chancellor of the duchy <e> <s> i can see nothing but benefit accruing to this country both in the general concept and in the way it is proposed to deal with it in two stages in terms of competition and efficiency in terms of opening minds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like for the second day running i am afraid to extend a full welcome to government action in this case in bringing in these proposals and at the same time i wish to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> in case my welcoming government proposals on two days running is embarrassing to the noble lord perhaps i should add that it is not only twice in two days but also twice in years <e> <s> so that will put the matter in perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i did not make one question sufficiently clear to the noble lord and that question concerns the period <e> <s> it is not simply a question of whether five years is too long or too short <e> <s> given that we have a period of five years and that the number of applications granted is six out of a much greater number i believe that there were about would it not be possible for the government to make an interim review of the situation prior to the expiry of five years with a view to considering whether further applicants might not then be reconsidered <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the figures which the noble lord has just given would he tell the house whether they are truly comparable <e> <s> that is to say are they on a real basis or at current prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may join in paying a short but very warm tribute to a great parliamentarian and a most co-operative colleague <e> <s> although it was as long ago as that i first came <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that answer <e> <s> i would ask him whether he is aware that there is still considerable anxiety among those who support the general principle of seat-belts lest further and avoidable injury be caused by the delay in releasing the mechanism <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has just said would it not be reasonable to ask him to be good enough to direct at least part of the research effort of his department into manufacturing some reliable and simple timing device whereby a passenger or driver could be released after the worst effect of the impact <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the very important piece of information which the minister has been good enough to give us namely that it takes on average seconds before a person in a car gathers his thoughts sufficiently to release himself make it clear that that period is quite sufficient for the person in question to be burned to death or drowned in a car which has fallen off a jetty or something like that <e> <s> therefore ought not the minister to use renewed efforts in terms of researching for some device which would automatically avoid this further disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am most grateful to him for that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what the corresponding figures for savings were over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be good enough to reconsider that answer because it is exactly the same question <e> <s> many members of your lordships house know that the increase in the volume of sales derives from the fall in savings and the noble lord should come to the house prepared to give that information <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the memorandum of agreement to which he referred is to be considered as a treaty with all that flows from that or as something of a lower status than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that untypically he has not answered the question on the order paper <e> <s> the question asked for the figures for unemployment and the noble earl gave us the figures for claimants <e> <s> is he able to tell us the total number of unemployed in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the answer to that private notice question <e> <s> our anxieties are the same as those that have been expressed already <e> <s> the government should do not only what they have done but more than they have done and more quickly to come to the assistance of those in great need <e> <s> i would not wish to delay the house with any other point <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of noble lords on these benches i too should like to thank the noble baroness most sincerely for repeating the statement but i ant bound to say that it is impossible to give it a sincere welcome <e> <s> it is a very important statement <e> <s> and one will want to consider it very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister for the clear enunciation of his reply <e> <s> that is about as far as i can go <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i was hoping very much that this house would take the same view as the other place namely that on nearly every occasion information of this kind comparisons would be given in constant prices and real terms rather than in figures as measured by a shrinking yardstick which are not at all meaningful <e> <s> does the noble lord feel that members of this house should be treated as second-rate citizens in this respect <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there have been at least two occasions when figures given at current prices have led to the conclusion more when at real prices the answer would have been less <e> <s> is that not unfortunate and likely to be misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be willing to reconsider this matter <e> <s> there is no party issue involved <e> <s> is it not the case that public expenditure white papers used to contain all the figures in both cash and constant prices <e> <s> is there any reason why perhaps two or three tables out of the totality should not be given in constant prices as well as in current ones and all the rest only in cash terms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure as well as my duty to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and who have helped me to understand the very important issue of whether or not this country is running down its national assets or maintaining them <e> <s> i hold to the view i originally held and i have heard nothing in the course of the debate to cause me to alter my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has made clear that the contract has not yet been entered into and as it is perfectly clear from comments made in various quarters of the house that there is great anxiety about the proposed price will the noble lord use his good offices to see that there is further negotiation and that the contract is not entered into at the price contemplated at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise shortly to support the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove on amendment no <e> <s> which i gather is under discussion at the moment and it would perhaps save time in the long run if i said what i need to say now rather than to wait until the amendment is separately moved <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for what he has already indicated <e> <s> my purpose is to maintain the law as it stands namely that travelling fairs are excluded <e> <s> it is simply that and that is why i support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the chancellor for the trouble that he has taken <e> <s> but does that answer indicate that the government came to a conclusion with regard to this years budget without considering that the totality of its effects was going to be in terms of a further widening or narrowing of the inequality of disposable incomes <e> <s> if they did so can the noble lord give us the results of their deliberations <e> <s> if they did not do so does this not indicate that the government are quite prepared to see the continuation of the direction which has already been formed by previous budgets of redistributing the burden of taxation from the comparatively well-to-do on to the shoulders of the comparatively poor <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear the noble lord the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster aright when he said that this measure was the most regular one used for measuring the inequality of incomes in this country <e> <s> is it not inevitable that if the government pursue their policy of reducing taxes on income and increasing taxes on expenditure the first being progressive and the second being considerably regressive what some people describe will become true <e> <s> namely that the governments purpose is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise shortly to add the support of these benches to the noble viscounts statement and to assure him that we accept his undertakings and his assurances in full <e> <s> i just want to add that we are particularly grateful to the leader of the house for his courtesy in coming here and explaining the matter in such detail and for his if i may say so wise and constructive suggestions and understanding of the true function of this house <e> <s> i congratulate him and of course we shall support his proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i will delay your lordships for the minimum time but i think it is right that we on these benches by which i mean the two participating parties in the alliance should make our position clear <e> <s> we regard this as an unfortunate amendment <e> <s> this amendment as has been made clear by the mover and seconder and by all who have spoken in favour of it goes to the heart of the bill <e> <s> every speech that has been made from the labour front bench has been a second reading speech it had to be because if one puts down an amendment that goes to the heart of a bill and one is speaking relevantly to the amendment then it has to be a speech which is in effect a second reading speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> do i gather from that that he accedes to the request contained in this question that when these figures are available they will be published together with a statement of the unemployed claimants <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to reconsider the answer that he gave to my noble friend lord sainsbury when he indicated that brand names could not be kept off new products because it was a matter for the drug manufacturers <e> <s> is it not the case that the drug manufacturers lend a very careful ear to what the government have to say to them having regard to the fact that the government are their main customer <e> <s> therefore so far as new products are concerned would it not be reasonable to expect that progress could be made in this difficult matter by paying attention to what my noble friend as chairman of the committee reported <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the approximately individuals who have benefited under the scheme according to the figure the noble viscount has just given can he say how many of those are still carrying on in business <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer but the noble earl must be reading an order paper different from mine <e> <s> i cannot find a single reference to the words compulsory redundancies <e> <s> what is assumed behind the question at least what i assumed would be understood is the possibility of people losing jobs compulsorily or voluntarily <e> <s> inasmuch as a comparison with steel proves that it is quite useful to have a separate subsidiary organisation trying to provide jobs where they are being lost would it not be sensible for the coal board to be doing something similar and for the government to be encouraging it to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be good enough to reconsider the answers he has given which seem clearly based on the assumption that there have always been pit closures as he has said and that there is no difference in the situation today <e> <s> that is not the picture as the miners see it <e> <s> it is a very different picture <e> <s> they see the government as being unappreciative of their circumstances <e> <s> would it not therefore be wise for the government to be seen to be taking some initiative directed towards the severity of the problem as the miners see it <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is with complete sincerity that we on these benches can thank the noble lord the minister for repeating a statement made in another place which i certainly regard as an important courtesy provided by the government i hope that he will acquit me of any discourtesy when i say that we cannot possibly welcome any statement of any kind which takes a step further in pursuing the unwise and damaging policy of attempting to turn this public monopoly into a privately-owned organisation <e> <s> the term used here is privatisation <e> <s> my first question to the noble lord is this <e> <s> am i correct in understanding that privatisation as used by the government means the transformation of a public monopoly with all the accountability and protection that that involves into a private monopoly without any accountability or protection at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for the courteous way in which he answered and very fully answered all the questions that i put to him <e> <s> i want to pursue only one further matter and that is the question of the short prospectus to which reference has already been made <e> <s> of course it is true that the government have legal authority to deal with this by way of a shortened prospectus but as the noble lord has made absolutely clear it is the intention of the government that these shares shall be offered for sale on foreign markets and as he has repeated today he may therefore be in the position of having to publish a fuller prospectus to satisfy the regulatory requirements particularly of the american stock exchange <e> <s> in those circumstances does the noble lord really suggest that it would be satisfactory i am not saying it would be illegal to publish a fully detailed prospectus for possible american purchasers and a reduced prospectus for all english subscribers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the anxiety which i know is being felt as both a member of your lordships house and an ever grateful national health service patient at this hospital may i say how much i am grateful to the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> i presume that the answer which the noble baroness has given refers to the great portland street centre <e> <s> therefore i do not think that it would be too strong a request to seek her categorical assurance that the future of the stanmore branch is equally secured <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in assuming that the answer which the noble lord gave in his first answer refers to the average consumer and does not therefore specifically refer to the budget of pensioners who generally buy in small quantities and find that the cost of food is somewhat higher <e> <s> has he any figures which specially refer to that standard of living <e>", "<cs> may i detain your lordships committee for a moment by pursuing not the essential merits of the amendment which have already been displayed so well but the point on which the noble lord lord bellwin is relying to resist the amendment <e> <s> he is saying that this might be a good idea but that we have no such procedure at present and that to propose it by means of an amendment to a bill is an ususual way to introduce such a procedure <e> <s> that is of course right but i invite the noble lord and the committee to consider that we are in the difficulty that we have a bill in which according to the merits of the argument this facility should exist <e> <s> if we do not provide for such an examination in the bill by means of the procedure of going to the procedure committee having a full debate bringing it back to the house and approving it we shall have lost the opportunity of providing for that examination under the rates act as it will then be <e> <s> if the noble lord says that if this procedure is initiated he will undertake to bring back the bill so that we can reinsert it that will dispose of my argument <e> <s> however i do not suppose that the noble lord will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness share the view that the best definition of poverty is that as perceived by people on the lowest level of incomes namely that they should share proportionately in the same increase in the standard of living as the rest of the population and if they fall behind that then their sense of poverty is increased <e> <s> therefore is it not the deliberate policy of the government at the present time to increase the perception of poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether he has the figures to show the trend over the last two three or perhaps four years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was good enough to refer to the question of mine which he answered a little earlier <e> <s> may i ask him whether he recollects that i found that answer totally unsatisfactory and insensitive <e> <s> can he recollect that i drew his attention to the fact that we were not talking about compulsory retirement involving money we were talking about communites villages wives and livelihoods <e> <s> may i ask him once more what possible argument is there against the coal boards showing goodwill and good sense in trying to set up an organisation parallel to that which the steel board set up and which proved so successful to demonstrate the governments real sincere interest in looking after displaced miners <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well for the minister a cabinet minister to call these figures and the study of these figures exotic but would it not be correct to say that he supports the governments policy of placing great reliance on some of these figures in assisting the government with their unemployment policies <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord help the house by giving in addition to the percentage figures the sums involved on a constant basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the government for letting us know their thinking at this very early stage in their considerations <e> <s> so far as the content of the statement is concerned we on these benches welcome the statement and welcome the governments action in giving us a chance to share in their early thinking <e> <s> as to that there are two major points on which the statement is silent and which i should like the minister to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for having introduced this matter in such a comprehensive way <e> <s> i am indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention because it shows that he was listening <e> <s> alas it does not show that he understood <e> <s> i was making exactly the opposite point <e> <s> i am saying that the nottingham miners deserve to be encouraged and the government are doing nothing but turning their backs on all mining problems and on all miners whether they come from nottingham derbyshire yorkshire or wherever <e> <s> the government say that they have nothing to do with it and i am saying that they ought to reconsider <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for having advanced that step in his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to offer my thanks to the noble lord the chancellor of the duchy for being good enough to repeat the statement which was made in another place and which surprisingly enough was capable of being repeated here after a very short time which gives one the impression that far fewer questions were asked in the other place than i propose to ask in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscounts attention been drawn to the figures published by <e>", "<cs> my lords it is so obvious to all of us here that the simple answer to the difficulties which have just been put before us is for the government to arrange that all the statutory orders are before the respective houses at one and the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has endorsed the point so wisely made by his noble friend i am talking about the noble lord lord orr-ewing who asked the question drawing our attention to the connection between investment and increased productivity <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he regards this as a good example of government investment wisely directed creating additional productivity and therefore additional employment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question asked of the noble baroness by the noble lord lord stewart is obviously of great interest to a vast number of members of this house probably more than half the membership of your lordships house and not merely to the noble lord lord stewart alone is it not totally inadequate for the noble baroness merely to promise to write to the noble lord <e> <s> will she be good enough to arrange for a question for written answer to be put down <e> <s> if she has any difficulty no doubt the noble lord lord stewart and i would be happy to oblige <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> the question i want to ask him is whether he does not consider that his spending minutes on the wrong bill is an abuse of the sense of responsibility which in this house noble lords and noble baronesses always apply to their own speeches <e> <s> the minister has spent minutes and we have not yet reached the main issue <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not realise that his having taken minutes i do not know how many speakers there are but there must be something like will mean that many of your lordships will want to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be good enough to give us the governments estimate of what the number to be added on to the figures he gave in his first answer is in respect of those available for work in addition to those whom he has already described <e> <s> if he does not have that estimate can he tell us when these figures will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl be kind enough to remind the house of the reasons which prompted the government to suggest such a living allowance on the purchasing power of at the time it was first determined <e> <s> could he also say what are the reasons why they now believe that the purchasing power of a smaller allowance is appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches believe strongly in the mixed economy <e> <s> we have a high regard for the achievements in the private sector and we have a high regard for the achievements in the public sector <e> <s> we are perfectly prepared therefore to examine on its merits any proposed transfer from public to private or from private to public <e> <s> that is what i propose to do as shortly as may be possible but i propose to have regard mainly to the principles of what the bill deals with not to the methods by which the bill proposes to achieve those ends <e> <s> as to the means perhaps we could leave those to the committee stage but i must make it absolutely clear that there will be many amendments from these benches at that stage in an endeavour to improve the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not interrupt him earlier because he did not interrupt me at all i thank him for that courtesy <e> <s> the whole house pays high regard to any noble lord who has sat in his position and considered all these matters carefully <e> <s> i regret that i have not yet read his report but of course will do so <e> <s> may i ask him about that report <e> <s> his speech so far has concentrated on the restrictions which will grow on the difficulties which will be removed and on all sorts of things for the future <e> <s> if he will forgive me for saying so what he said amounts to little more than a declaration of faith <e> <s> my question is did he and his colleagues find evidence of the difficulties and restrictions stated in the report which have prevented the royal ordnance factories from doing as well as they might have done <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any specific examples <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord going to leave the question of the strathcona report <e> <s> if so before he does that may i ask him whether he is able to confirm as was alleged in the debate in the other place that the strathcona report included the following comments <e> <s> the first was that it gave as its verdict that the organisation had demonstrated its management strengths <e> <s> the second was that since the introduction of the new arrangements in purely financial terms the royal ordnance factory organisation has also been very successful <e> <s> the third one was that benefits accrue to both sides from the present relationship between the royal ordnance factories and the rest of the ministry of defence <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether or not these quotations are correct and whether therefore the speech we heard was a fair sample of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and i am grateful to him for giving way will he turn his mind to the main thrust of the debate <e> <s> the main thrust of the debate was not whether the rofs are doing very well indeed and have done very well indeed and i am grateful to the noble lord for saying in his winding up speech that they have done even better than he said in his earlier speech the main thrust of the debate is who is going to assure the forces of this country if we are left with no public sector but only with a private sector that they can get the supplies they need first in an emergency through spare capacity being available and secondly at any time when no private supplier will supply them because it is uncommercial to attempt to do so whereas the rofs are compelled to do so under the present arrangements for the mod <e>", "<cs> my lords i too on behalf of my noble friends and colleagues thank the noble viscount for repeating this very important statement in this house <e> <s> may i say to him that we give it a rather warmer welcome than has been indicated by the noble lord who speaks for the labour benches <e> <s> we give the statement a rather warmer welcome because although we are very conscious and anybody who knows my past history will not challenge this of the need to control expenditure and fix budgets and to work within those budgets and not to be sloppy about it as appears to have been the case we nevertheless take the view that what is important in all this is that we cease to have a business haggle and that we turn to working together as partners for the good of europe to decide the future of europe and to decide the europe of the future <e> <s> that is what the economic community is about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that one of the reasons that i put down this question for a second time was so that i could apologise to him and indeed the house which i now do for not being in my place when it was arranged the first time notwithstanding the fact that for the previous half-hour my eyes had been glued to a large clock on the wall which was some minutes slow <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord what is the precise form of the indications from his department with regard to manufacturers and their production of coaches in anticipation of any possible development along the lines that he has indicated <e> <s> for example would it not now be wise not to bring in legislation but to indicate to manufacturers that there is considerable feeling about the dangers which are unnecessarily incurred by those in coaches without seat-belts and that they might for example be encouraged to include in their specification seat-belt couplings and other points such as that which would help the matter forward <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> could he refresh our minds with regard to the simple figures <e> <s> would he give the figures of the electorate which could be held to support the proposition he is putting forward and the total figures of the electorate that could be held not to support it <e>", "<cs> i apologise for delaying the committee but i am unhappy about this amendment and i shall explain why <e> <s> i hope that those on the labour front bench will be good enough to listen to the cause of my anxiety because it may be that they will have some anxiety themselves <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> i heard the noble earl say that but with the greatest respect to him i cannot see that it makes the slightest difference because it must be carried in both places <e> <s> the convention is not merely as it is in other matters that we do not vote against a second reading of a government bill coming from the other place it is not that <e> <s> the convention on this has to be different because it is not covered by the parliament act and if we did not vote in the same way as the other house we would be in total conflict with it immediately <e> <s> therefore i say that what this amendment is giving your lordships is words only <e> <s> whoever said it was cosmetic was using the precise description of what the position is <e> <s> that is the first reason for my anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while expressing my gratitude to the noble viscount for that answer may i ask him whether he is aware that there is considerable confusion among ministers as to the extent of what he calls the restraint and what i might call the conventions under which this house works particularly with regard to second and third readings and in regard to the motions which have recently been laid before your lordships house <e> <s> therefore does he not think it would be helpful if this matter were to be examined by the appropriate committee and reported on so that the house would have an opportunity to decide the extent of the conventions and whether the house ought to be bound by them <e> <s> is it not of considerable importance that when he and his noble friends find themselves sitting on this side of the chamber they should feel bound by pecisely the same self-denying ordinance as do the present opposition parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords being aware that the appetite of your lordships for matters of this kind is fully satisfied i will content myself by saying that i shall read the ministers answer carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that we on these benches are most grateful to the noble viscount for two reasons first for his courtesy in making the statement and secondly for the further evidence which he has shown ever since he became our leader i hope the house will permit me to use the phrase our leader of his willingness to listen to the views of your lordships house especially when they are expressed with great clarity and to carry them favourably with his colleagues in the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in recollecting that the minister said that these circumstances were being examined that is to say as to whether some ladies successfully resided for a week in what was called thick scrub <e> <s> when those circumstances have been examined is it the ministers intention to make a further statement as to the result of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am getting up at this point because i thought that nobody else was rising in order to expand on what my noble ally has said with regard to this series of amendments <e> <s> i thought it was appropriate that the alliance point of view with regard to the future of all these councils should be made clear and why <e> <s> first i must start by acknowledging my agreement with what the leader of the house said at the start of his speech and my appreciation for what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord clearly was not listening to what he himself said on an earlier occasion when he supported the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as an ex-member of the other place and as one whose office and responsibilities were terminated sharply and involuntarily both as to membership of another place and as an office-holder let me first of all declare that unhappily i have no interest whatever <e> <s> i am grateful as we all are to the noble viscount for having introduced this bill and to the noble lord lord ponsonby for having gone into it in a certain amount of detail <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking him very much indeed may i ask the noble viscount for his assurance that when the further proceedings are terminated not necessarily in the court to which they are going at the moment there will be at least an opportunity for further discussion by way of a statement being made though with possibly a greater opportunity than that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i direct the noble lords mind to the question on the order paper which is about long-term unemployment <e> <s> may i ask him whether he takes the view that among the jobless possibly the greatest suffering and certainly the greatest demoralisation is experienced by the long-term unemployed <e> <s> has he not just told us that normally it is the case that where unemployment does decrease long-term unemployment lags behind that decrease <e> <s> therefore is it not the case that the government ought to be devoting special attention to the long-term <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to assure the noble lord the minister of our appreciation of his repeating the statement and of the sympathy we have for him in being required to carry out yet again a most unpleasant task <e> <s> the statement however it has been worded and however complex it is intended to he simply means that the government and particularly the noble lords department and his right honourable friend totally failed last year to carry out their responsibilities for maintaining monitoring supervising and controlling capital expenditure by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will be good enough to reconsider the answer he gave me and the noble lord lord graham with regard to there being no change in the rules <e> <s> perhaps i may say to him again that there is clear change in the rules in midstream <e> <s> may i ask him to look at the statement which he has just made <e> <s> from that he will see that until now prior to making the statement the position was that local authorities were allowed to spend money on capital expenditure derived from three sources i emphasise three sources <e> <s> the first one was the allocation the second was the proportion of the sales in that year and the third one was the amount accumulated from savings through sales in previous years <e> <s> there were three sources <e> <s> it is really very elementary <e>", "<cs> i want to support everything that the noble lord lord graham has said on this important amendment at the commencement of our discussions on the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> the background to this amendment is a proposal which has been opposed by all opposition parties in both houses <e> <s> it has been opposed by the representatives of more than per cent <e> <s> of the electorate at the last general election <e> <s> it is being put forward by the representatives of some per cent <e> <s> of the electorate who voted conservative at the last general election <e>", "<cs> i should like to support very strongly but briefly what the noble lord lord graham has said about this matter i understand although it has not been made absolutely clear that the government may want to sell in terms of four separate companies <e> <s> it is not absolutely clear from what the noble minister said at second reading but he may want to reserve the power to do that <e> <s> i beg him as a businessman not to commit such business nonsense <e> <s> he surely must give the new owners under any scheme he makes the opportunity to decide whether they want to run the business as a whole or in parts <e> <s> all the evidence of previous examination has pointed to the same result <e> <s> every businessman in your lordships house would agree with me i am sure that it is virtually criminal that it is commercial folly to divide up a business like this with all the additional overheads the lack of integration and the damage to well-proven loyalties that result from dividing it up <e> <s> no businessman would dream of running it in this way in which the government want to have enabling power and may want to use it <e> <s> if the minister wants to avoid destroying the morale and usefulness of these factories i beg him to leave them as one unit <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> can he say why any number of foreign shares is appropriate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words since the noble lord has referred to amendment no <e> <s> which i do not propose to move <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> refers to a foreign shareholding and by the argument objects to a foreign shareholding of per cent <e> <s> i merely want to say to the noble lord that per cent <e> <s> of the holding in one company held in one pair of hands is a very dangerous holding <e> <s> it is not a question of one share it is a question of per cent <e> <s> of the total shareholding <e> <s> it is quite normal for a government in circumstances such as these to prevent the shareholding in one pair of hands going above per cent <e> <s> i think therefore that this is a bad provision <e> <s> they should limit it to nil <e>", "<cs> i want to support everything that the noble lord lord graham has said <e> <s> as is the case with most of the amendments we are moving this amendment is very much in the interests of parliament and parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> as i understand it it was desired to consider at the same time amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to speak to that also <e>", "<cs> with great respect the noble lord has got it very nearly right <e> <s> of course the directors only appoint the auditors in an interim way until their appointment can be confirmed by the shareholders because the auditors are responsible to the shareholders of a company <e> <s> the noble lord has got it quite right and with great respect i thought that the noble lord lord graham had got it quite right when he said that this seemed to be an appropriate occasion to consider very carefully what the minister has had to say with regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however amendment no <e> <s> is a different matter and i shall move it when i am fortunate enough to catch the chairmans eye <e>", "<cs> i must ask the question where in the bill does it say independent valuers <e> <s> if that phrase appears in the bill i shall immediately withdraw my amendment <e> <s> if it does not inasmuch as both the noble lord and minister and i are in favour of independent valuers let us include them in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i must be boring the committee too but i just do not see that either <e> <s> the noble lord is sticking to a preconceived idea <e> <s> i am sorry to be a little obstinate about this but we are both after the same thing <e> <s> we are both after protecting the state and the safest way to do this is to see that the phrase goes verbatim and specifically into the bill <e>", "<cs> i respond although i have no expertise and a poor memory and it is a long time since i was a practising accountant <e> <s> we are talking about a valuation by a valuer not a valuation by a firm of accountants <e> <s> of course they have certain duties as do directors in regard to valuations as to whether or not they can regard them as reasonable <e> <s> but the first essential is that there should be a valuation by someone who knows how to value <e> <s> no practising chartered accountant claims to know how to value all these millions of pounds worth of assets <e> <s> no sensible government ought to put themselves in a position of being liable to be criticised for not taking normal protective steps <e> <s> therefore on behalf of all the parties in the committee i suggest that we pursue this <e>", "<cs> at the risk of going one stage further any sensible businessman would adopt neither of the suggestions made <e> <s> if this amount of plant were to be valued he would go to one of the well known practising firms which value plant of this size and dimension and get a proper professional valuation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his courtesy but not for the content of his reply <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the consideration which the minister has given to this matter which his department has given and which the ministry of defence no doubt has given as well <e> <s> i cannot imagine a responsible government putting forward a bill like this without having considered these matters <e> <s> but what the noble lord is saying is you must trust us <e> <s> he is saying we want to be rid of any constraints by parliament <e> <s> you must trust us <e> <s> we know best how to run all this <e> <s> i do not believe that ministers and their civil service advisers do know best <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what was said by the noble lord the minister and he did not seem to me to be saying precisely that in subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not seen fit to answer my question precisely and so all that i can do is read very carefully what he said and see whether it amounts to a satisfactory situation <e> <s> if not i shall return to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for his support <e> <s> i agree with everything he has said both in words and in spirit <e> <s> may i add this <e> <s> he said he has had experience on the employee side <e> <s> i have certainly had experience on the employer and management side <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord the minister that a company works best when it has the advantage of close co-operation with the workforce <e> <s> the workforce feel they are wanted are being consulted are sitting next to you listening to what you are talking about and having an opportunity to put their oar in at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> i am not going to let the minister get away with this <e> <s> what he is saying is totally opposed to current practice <e> <s> there are dozens of the most respected companies in the city which have non-executive directors elected <e> <s> in the first place they are appointed by the board and then subsequently confirmed by the shareholders <e> <s> they are drawn from a wide level of experience because of that experience <e> <s> it is an insult to such directors to say that they are coming on to the boards solely to represent the companies from which they come <e>", "<cs> i quite agree <e> <s> i have already said that the best way is for people to want this to happen rather than impose it on them <e> <s> i agree with the comment that the minister made on an earlier intervention about not forcing this on anybody <e> <s> we shall be very happy to amend the wording of the amendment if he gives us any encouragement whatsoever in any way that he likes to provide that there is no question of forcing it that is to say if two suitable individuals are not available or do not want to come <e> <s> my experience was not the difficulty of the board not wanting to get such assistance but of the workforce not being happy about such assistance being made available and the difficulties the other way round <e> <s> but if the noble lord can think of a way of wording it we shall gladly word it that way <e>", "<cs> having heard what the noble lord has said particularly about the words being entrenched that is to say that the provision is a reliable provision i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> certainly the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> which i did not dwell upon was merely to get the assurance which the noble lord has already given and so there is no problem about that <e> <s> as regards the other four amendments what the minister is really saying is that we are not poles apart but that there may be slightly defective elements within these amendments which is not all that surprising and in any event what the government want to do is to be perfectly free to consider them in their own time and in the circumstances of each individual scheme <e> <s> that is characteristic of the governments approach to the whole of this bill nothing goes into the bill everything remains in the free will of the minister whoever it may be at the time and we have already expressed our dislike of that <e>", "<cs> may i congratulate the noble baroness lady vickers not only on having moved this amendment enabling it therefore to be discussed with the most important matters that are being discussed but on obtaining from the minister more expressions of understanding and semi-undertakings than anyone else has been able to obtain on this side of the committee <e> <s> your lordships may wonder therefore why i am rising to address the committee <e> <s> it is because of the other things that the noble lord went on to say <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has gone a long way towards meeting the essence of the points covered by these two amendments <e> <s> of course i accept the qualification of commercial matters secrecy and so on <e> <s> i accept that completely and as i understand it both amendments will be met in the sense that the government have said they will do everything practicable to meet the sense of these amendments but will not be willing to have them incorporated in a bill <e> <s> so far as it goes at committee stage that is satisfactory <e> <s> we can come back to this at a later stage <e> <s> i repeat my gratitude and i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> do i gather from the noble lord the minister that he is suggesting it would be for the convenience of the committee if amendment no <e> <s> were discussed at the same time <e> <s> he has referred to it but the noble lord who moved the amendment did not <e>", "<cs> it is the employment assessment tribunal <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will allow me to intervene at this stage <e> <s> i am in a little difficulty because the noble lord referred considerably to the redundancy question which is again the subject of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> if it is for the convenience of the committee i will say a word about amendment no <e> <s> but if the minister prefers this to be left until a later stage i will leave it <e>", "<cs> very well i will take both <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to detain your lordships and i recognise that the hour is late but on this question of adding schedule to the bill i must return to the question of the future employees of the rofs both in terms of their pension arrangements and in terms of their redundancy arrangements <e> <s> both those arrangements have been referred to on amendments within this schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of where the statistics of the opcs to which he referred are to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise on behalf of these benches to express our appreciation and to concur <e>", "<cs> my lords is the measure of the benefit of tourism only pounds shillings and pence <e> <s> is it not the case that there is great benefit from people learning to understand one another seeing one anothers habits seeing how people live in their own homes and their own countries <e> <s> is it not a much wider point than the minister indicated in agreeing to a labour intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand from a reply to an earlier question that the government have settled their policy in this area could the noble lord give us an indication of what the levels of exchequer grant exchequer contribution to the rates will be over the next two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to give way <e> <s> i have listened most attentively to everything that he has said and this is the first part i have not been able to follow <e> <s> why does <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the way in which the noble viscount has moved the motion and explained it and made it very simple to understand <e> <s> however that perhaps leaves two questions which i could address to him <e> <s> in the first place in the event of the exact indexation figure not being available at the time that some of your lordships may find it convenient to submit expense claims would the noble viscount indicate the exact way in which noble lords should fill in their claims <e> <s> it so happens that the house will be sitting on st august <e>", "<cs> my lords may i trouble the noble viscount once more for further clarification as to what he meant when he said he was listening to the noble baroness lady elliot with sympathy <e> <s> he referred to the fact that when he was a member for many years his wife was not able to accompany him and as we all know this can cause domestic problems <e> <s> i take the view that your lordships are more not less entitled than members of another place to be rid of any impediment or inhibition which prevents unpaid honorary members of your lordships house coming to attend to their national duties out of a sense of conscience which is what happens at the moment <e> <s> therefore i am very sympathetically inclined indeed to what the noble baroness suggested especially if it were a matter not limited to members of your lordships house who happen to sit across the border but were extended to members in any place in any part of the country <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble lord lord grimond may i ask the minister whether he includes the term contingent liability among the liabilities excepted under clause <e> <s> the situation which i understand might well arise is of an application being made upon which certain guidance is given by the agency but under which no immediate liability arises on the agency <e> <s> if the agency comes to an end at that point and the applicant then proceeds to complete his part of what he understood to be a bargain he will be placed in the very difficult situation of not being able to call upon the agency to complete its part because of course at the time there was no completed bargain and no absolute liability <e> <s> at the most there was a contingent liability that is the agency had given the applicant to understand that if certain procedures were completed the agency would assist and it had the liability for financial assistance or assistance in some other form <e> <s> therefore i am asking the minister whether the liabilities included in the earlier clause to which he referred include contingent liabilities of the kind i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> may i also ask her in view of her statement that the government have not yet made up their mind what the justification is for insisting that the eldest daughters of hereditary peers are more capable than the younger brothers of serving her majesty in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness help me with my private members bill to which she has made reference <e> <s> does she know how many peers would not be here but would he peeresses if i am not misunderstood if instead of succeeding to the title their elder sisters had so succeeded <e> <s> does she happen to know the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest possible deference perhaps i may make a practical suggestion <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the law it is to do with the clock <e> <s> it is now <e> <s> it is intended to break at <e> <s> everybody would enjoy the opportunity to think further and take further advice <e> <s> is it necessary to come to a conclusion before the break <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are all grateful to the government for studying the report but we cannot understand what is the difficulty about allowing others to study the report at the same time <e> <s> is the noble lord in difficulty about getting a second copy <e> <s> if so we would be glad to help him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord if he would be kind enough to give way as he has referred to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to him for telling me that i apparently said <e> <s> of course the year to which i was referring was <e> <s> i apologise for the fact <e> <s> my eyes will be better after the recess after a certain amount of surgery <e> <s> i merely read the wrong figure <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of all those who have contributed to this debate i am sure i can say to the noble earl lord gowrie that we are grateful to him for the care which he has taken to answer so many of the points put forward by speakers <e> <s> all that remains for me to do is to repeat my thanks and to explain the anxiety i had when i put down the motion <e> <s> i feared that i might be criticised because a very wide motion might result in the debate being a series of parallel thrusts which never meet we would therefore have had no confrontation of the kind which happened in another place quite recently <e> <s> i feel that your lordships have been very kind indeed in accepting the view that a very broadly based motion was suitable at this time to give all of us an opportunity to contribute and to give the government an opportunity of covering a very wide field <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be the intention of her majestys government when this decision is made to issue a white paper setting out clearly what the government understand by the word costs <e> <s> there are direct costs there are indirect costs there is cash expenditure there is damage and there are various other items <e> <s> it is obviously in the public interest to know exactly what is the total and how the government view it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is not in agreement with my noble friend as to the adequacy of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister think again as regards what he said about this being a very unusual thing to ask the government to do <e> <s> the government are acting as a steward and the noble baroness lady vickers is suggesting that the goverment should account for their stewardship from time to time and instead of leaving the time open and vague that they should account for their stewardship once a year <e> <s> no specific date is given and whether it is a week earlier or later than the anniversary of the last report would not matter very much <e> <s> but at all events there would be a report <e> <s> there must be dozens of other reports which the government lay before parliament because of the stewardship which parliament has given them <e> <s> what is unusual about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support what has been said to apologise to the house for not being in my place at an earlier stage last week and to say how grateful i am to the minister and to others who made courteous references to me in my absence <e> <s> your lordships already know that we on this side of the house whatever party we belong to deplore this bill for all the reasons that have been given <e> <s> however objective one is in trying to see benefits from the bill from the government point of view one is totally unable to do so <e> <s> speeches have been made other than from these benches echoing what i am now saying <e> <s> it is regrettable in the extreme that the government are carrying what is clearly a deep but nevertheless dogmatic conviction to these extremes and are allowing themselves to do so in an area where anxieties must be caused by their action <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the minister with all the greatest respect that it is possible for any objectively minded person to be rather unclear about what the government are saying having regard for the fact that two of his answers did not seem to line up completely one with the other <e> <s> may i therefore ask him whether if on reconsidering the matter and reading the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that he seems to have gone back on the attitude of her majestys government with regard to this important issue <e> <s> would he care to make it absolutely clear that the government are still in favour in principle of taking this further step <e> <s> is he further aware that there are many authoritative voices we have just heard one most authoritative voice and there are many others who take the view that it is extremely appropriate now to take that further step <e> <s> if he is not in agreement with that as to timing when can we look forward to the government ending this question mark over their policy and making a clear decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it would be more convenient if i said what i have to say now rather than after the minister has responded to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he add in fairness to the house what he means when he says that the scheme will be put before parliament <e> <s> when will it be put before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try though i know i will fail to express something of the deep sadness and shock that overwhelms every one of us on these benches <e> <s> this act of blind violence has come at a time when we need no reminding in this country that this madness is abroad and that no free society can defend itself completely against it <e> <s> this act of violence has happened in a country of deep and ancient civilisation where every man and woman has before them the knowledge that whereas violence has never persuaded anybody determined non-violence has succeeded in moving mountains <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to thank the noble baroness for having fully explained the matter <e> <s> it is an important matter <e> <s> the population is small but the principle is not as small <e> <s> indeed the principle is quite large

his own account but also on your lordships account <e> <s> i regard it as very important indeed that your lordships house should be as well represented in the cabinet as it is today <e> <s> indeed i see three cabinet ministers sitting on the government front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that there are four altogether and it is particularly favourable and important for your lordships

the noble lord aware that no one on these benches finds himself in any sympathy at all with the supplementary question of the noble lord opposite a very old and personal friend of mine <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that reply how does the noble earl explain the following facts which emerge very clearly from table in the recently published inland revenue statistics which continue the series which

might be worthwhile either now or at a later stage when he has given the proposed experiment a chance to run referring this matter to the committee of procedure with the suggestion that it should consider whether it might not be right as a minister has by this kind of reply given the question the characteristics of a written question to treat his response as turning that part of the question automatically into a question for written answer <e> <s> this would enable the answer which the minister has promised in writing to be reproduced in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the leader of the house for being good enough to repeat the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that we on these benches welcome a great deal of what

ireland that as the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious for information if the minister has it now if not perhaps he will follow the new procedure and make it available <e> <s> i should like to know whether any progress has been made in adding back seat-belts to the regulations covering front seat-belts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that many of your lordships will be indebted as i am to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls for at least two reasons <e> <s> first the noble lord made clear the same remarks go for every speaker who has opposed the motion that he wants reconsideration of the resolution which this house agreed in december last year <e> <s> the noble lord says that these are second thoughts and that he wants to go back on the resolution <e> <s> so does the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls for making it clear that a vote for the amendment of the noble lord lord chalfont is a vote against the resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount give way for a moment <e> <s> i am most grateful for his answer and most grateful to him for the consideration that he has given <e> <s> will he make it clear that what he has been saying refers exclusively to the experimental period alone <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that today we are debating the effects of government policy on unemployment and here is an example where the government are enacting a policy which although helpful to service industries and i am second to none in approving of that is nevertheless making it less likely that there will be inward investment in manufacturing industry in this country as a result of which there will undoubtedly be more unemployment in this country than there was before <e> <s> is it not right that your lordships house should take particular note of policy formation at the point of time when it is being formed which is now <e>", "<cs> my lords is the chief whip correct in saying that his noble friend will repeat a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i can at all events say with complete sincerity that we are grateful to the noble lord for having repeated the statement in your lordships house <e> <s> inasmuch as the statement makes absolutely clear that there has been a most massive participation by employees of the company we on these benches who believe in such wide participation warmly welcome that fact <e> <s> i do not know whether the position has yet gone far enough for the minister to be able to say what proportion of the total shareholding will now be held by the total force of employees <e>", "<cs> my lords the word scandal is much overused in your lordships house <e> <s> nevertheless does not the minister think that it is near scandalous that all the funds that we are currently discussing will be handed over to the chancellor will be lost sight of in the national accounts and will be used to pay for the groceries in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords what is not hypothetical however is the noble earls statement in i think his first answer that the government believe in switching from taxes on earnings which are progressive to the vat tax which is regressive <e> <s> why does the noble earl support a policy which means putting the burden of taxation on to the narrow shoulders and taking it off the broad shoulders <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the switch from a single completely unacceptable decision to a series of completely unacceptable decisions evidence of the unfitness of this government to govern <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord to whom i have been listening with the greatest possible care has now left his point about the responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the civil service let me say that i have agreed with every single word that he has said <e> <s> but i should be grateful if he would complete it and say if he agrees that in all the circumstances it is not a general responsibility it is the responsibility of ministers <e> <s> civil servants are directly responsible to ministers and in return it is the responsibility of ministers to do everything to maintain the morale of the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for making it quite clear that he has gone as far as he reasonably can under the act in putting before your lordships house a number of details which have not yet been settled but may i come back to the earliest part of his answer when he referred to the fact that progress had been made <e> <s> does that mean that no definite transfer as envisaged by section has yet taken place and would that not be regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords if work continues on it then obviously no transfer has taken place <e> <s> why then could we not have had even the whole of half a days delay so that the house of lords should be consulted as it had decided on a vote <e>", "<cs> my lords on a slightly ancillary point in as much as the purpose as i understand it of question time is to elicit information from the responsible minister and in as much as there is never enough space on the order paper for all those peers who are anxious to elicit further information may i ask the minister or perhaps the leader of the house whether it is the governments intention to encourage questions which by their very form that is asking whether the government agree cannot be asking for any further information whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords on the limited aspect of giving notification to parliament is it not the case according to my recollection it certainly used to be the practice that it is normal for the treasury to seek an opportunity to advise parliament of a contingent liability which it is undertaking and which would otherwise not be known to parliament until the estimates came before it at some later date <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why on behalf of my colleagues on these benches i seek to detain your lordships for but a moment is not that i could add anything to the well-deserved tributes that have already been paid but that we would naturally want sir david to know and to feel assured that all of us on these benches are also deeply indebted to him <e> <s> many of us have had first-hand experience of the benefits to be gained from his many and varied duties <e> <s> the leader has referred especially to the variety of duties and indeed that is the case ranging from such an impossibly difficult task as finding additional accommodation where none exists to the comparatively easy task i should have thought of keeping order in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were sitting on the benches behind the noble lord the minister who has just repeated the statement i would feel the same uncertainty now as i have been feeling since the last general election as to what was the governments real policy with regard to maintaining a strong pound <e> <s> one thought that one always knew what was the conservative partys attitude to the pound <e> <s> it was a justifiable attitude on a very difficult issue <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain what is the general philosophy in that matter other than scraping the barrel to find whatever money they can and continuing the process of selling the family silver in order to pay for the groceries <e> <s> i can understand no other reason myself <e> <s> it is not a question of privatisation it is a question of realisation of shares for cash <e> <s> it is very simple indeed <e> <s> privatisation is totally irrelevant to the announcement that the government have just made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with his noble friend that the recent increase in interest rates is as i think he said a good thing <e> <s> can we look forward to the repetition of these good things in the governments policy and have a number of further increases in interest rates week by week <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord if in considering what steps might be taken to improve the possibilities of detection he will bear in mind that auditors believe that a principle on which they operate is a good one and has been found to be beneficial <e> <s> it is that if you wish to examine and ascertain whether any improper transaction has taken place you do not need to examine every transaction but the knowledge that you might examine any transaction is a useful deterrent <e> <s> would the noble lord therefore be good enough to consider whether this principle might not be incorporated into those procedures where it is thought impossible for example that everybody entering a building should have his baggage or his person checked <e> <s> so long as it was known that at any moment of night or day anybody might be asked to submit to such an examination might that not be held to be a useful deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earls first answer mean anything more than the simple fact that the government have been using the proceeds of a most valuable national asset to meet current expenditure <e> <s> when will the government cease this preposterous practice of selling off the family silver to pay for the groceries <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble earl keep on referring to short term speculative pressures when the pound has been coming down if one looks at the graph almost in a straight line from the time when it was at to the time today when it is <e> <s> how on earth can the noble earl reconcile that with the true situation <e> <s> how on earth can he reconcile the facts with what his noble friend lord eccles has just said about the miners strike <e> <s> of course the miners strike has done enormous damage to the economy of this country but why should sterling suddenly shoot downwards not even fall but shoot downwards when the miners strike looks like being settled <e> <s> why does he take comfort from the noble lord lord bruce gardyne who suggests to him that it is purely temporary and that the pound is likely to go up <e> <s> does he recollect that another noble lord i am grateful for his attention asked him a similar question only a short time ago with the same result and the net result has been that the pound has gone down since then <e> <s> when will the government take their responsibilities in this field seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords owing to the total inadequacy of the noble earls right honourable friends statement and to the inadequacy of the noble earls replies and indeed to the inappropriateness of this kind of exchange for dealing with this most serious situation we shall certainly be pressing through the usual channels for a full debate in the governments time <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like to record our gratitude to the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> the minister will be glad to know that i have no questions to ask beyond those which have already been put so well by the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> we on these benches take the view that a minister acts in good faith until the contrary is proved that he acted in good faith in the actions he took and thought that he was carrying out the will of parliament <e> <s> it appears that he was not carrying out the will of parliament and therefore the matter must be clarified <e> <s> i am most grateful to him and to the government for the decision they have taken to reintroduce this matter to parliament so that all these issues and allegations can be fully debated and fully discussed in both houses <e> <s> to my mind that is the proper way of carrying on <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we endorse that <e> <s> i have already indicated that we on these benches certainly endorse the attitude the government have taken <e> <s> but i must press the noble lord a little further on the question of retrospective legislation as indeed he has been pressed by those on the benches behind him <e> <s> does not the noble lord realise that although parliament can do a great deal it cannot bail the government out on every mistake they make <e> <s> if the government have made a mistake and have been supported by parliament and the court has drawn attention to that mistake the law is the law as the judge has decided <e> <s> that covers the period up to the date when the new legislation is brought in or becomes effective <e> <s> in those circumstances how can the government possibly justify coming to parliament with a proposal which is flatly in contradiction with what the judge has decided was the law of the land at the time the judge was asked to make the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the figure of the percentage employed may i ask the noble lord to what extent the increase in the number of married women in jobs particularly part-time jobs accounts for part of that figure <e> <s> may i also ask him whether it means anything more than that the living standards in this country are now such that it requires two breadwinners in each family to make ends meet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for repeating the answer to the private notice question <e> <s> we on these benches take the view that a minister acts with ministerial propriety until the contrary is proved <e> <s> but there does seem to be a certain amount of conflict of evidence here which causes some questionmarks <e> <s> it is not absolutely clear from the noble earls repetition of the statement whether the government are saying that there was no ministerial impropriety or whether they are saying that there was no official impropriety <e> <s> i should be grateful for clarification of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for those figures <e> <s> do they add up to the estimate which has been widely publicised of a cost between billion and billion in total whether it arises in this year or the following year <e> <s> as those are the economic costs only and in view of the enormous personal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls reply to me earlier on was not wholly unsympathetic <e> <s> may i ask him whether he accepts that it is the duty of a politician to have regard to timing and whether therefore in view of what he has said about the lessons that have been learnt he does not think that it would shortly be very appropriate in terms of timing for the government to launch an educational campaign which it might not be possible to do at other times <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount for that very full explanation of the amounts paid under what i think is generally called short money in which all the parties in the other house share on the basis of both seats won and votes gained <e> <s> however the noble viscount has not told me what amounts apart from salaries the treasury bears in regard to this house <e> <s> if the answer is none i should want to ask the noble viscount why there is this enormous discrepancy between the two houses <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the noble viscount for repeating this important and full statement on the prime ministers recent visit <e> <s> we welcome such visits they must obviously be of benefit <e> <s> we congratulate the noble lady on the number of important persons in american life whom she was able to meet <e> <s> we hope that the noble viscount will be good enough to convey to the noble lady <e>", "<cs> the right honourable lady the prime minister my lords our congratulations on the great energy she displayed in putting forward the governments views <e> <s> i say the governments views because of course we do not share all the views expressed in the statement certainly with regard to sdi where we have the greatest reservations for the reasons already given <e> <s> although i note that every time the government refer to sdi they also refer to the fact that research is permitted under the abm treaty i wonder whether that is for self assurance or whether it is a statement of fact <e> <s> there are those who have hesitation on this topic and there are certainly many of us who believe that although it might be just within the legal framework of the treaty it is certainly not within the spirit of the treaty and it could be setting a most unfortunate precedent for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support the last sentence of the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> i want to put before your lordships two simple propositions <e> <s> the first is that this bill is clearly retrospective <e> <s> the second is that we should say so <e> <s> i hope that i do not need to delay your lordships house by explaining how abhorrent is retrospective legislation <e> <s> it is a denial of personal liberty <e> <s> it is an affront to natural justice <e> <s> i cannot think of cases even though my noble ally has imagined them where we are justified in saying to an individual or a body you acted lawfully but we are going to decide that what you did lawfully shall now be deemed unlawful <e> <s> that is the effect of retrospective legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> is he suggesting to the house that because the glc has acted in a way which he or the government do not like that justifies the government bringing in retrospective legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the ministers statement that british exports have maintained their share in the american market can he say on an exactly comparable basis what has happened to the share achieved by germany and in particular by japan <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble viscount <e> <s> the noble viscount has said that the main cause of the instability of the currency is not lack of confidence in british economic policy but is entirely due to the movement of oil the increase in price and then the flood of oil <e> <s> how does the noble viscount reconcile that with these two facts first with the fact that sterling has fallen every month since to less than half its then rate and secondly with the fact that oil production has increased at the same time month by month and that in january when sterling was undergoing all its worst variations and knocking on the floor the production of oil so far as the exchequer was concerned was at its greatest <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i only rise to say that in each of his last three speeches he has made to me the same statement which i have never been able to follow that i am out of step with my leader <e> <s> i know of no instance in which that is the case <e> <s> in something which i do know the tory party has been requested to make as a political point on every possible occasion as indeed has the labour party we understand that very well <e> <s> but i am unaware of any single instance on the past three occasions on which the noble earl has been pleased to make this comment of there having been any difference at all <e> <s> if there were i would be grateful to him for pointing it out <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recollect that the normal practice of informing the house following a question is that the ministry via the private office advises the library and that the library has the information available <e> <s> is he further aware that having checked that following a question which i put to the leader of the house i find that it is working very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble earl finds the situation totally explicable <e> <s> he will forgive me however for reminding him that one question has been asked twice and not answered <e> <s> we are all very interested in it and may i put it <e> <s> therefore a third time <e> <s> those of us who listen carefully to what the government have to say recollect that three weeks ago the government through their official spokesman the minister in question said the very opposite to what is now being stated <e> <s> it is a simple question <e> <s> may we have the answer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord said in reply to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord dean that he fully agreed with him did he mean that he was endorsing the estimates of the extent of black market tax evasion <e> <s> if not what is his estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is obviously very concerned with what the noble baroness is saying <e> <s> i am a little concerned about her statement that she cannot refer to the answer in detail with regard to the difference between ministers and senior diplomats <e> <s> will the noble baroness accept from me without bothering about the detail that a minister is fully entitled to look at his own papers at the time he was a minister <e> <s> why then should there be this extraordinary difference between a minister and a senior diplomat <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the assistance that is given includes assistance towards the type of structure of the employing bodies <e> <s> i have in mind for example assistance towards encouraging some co-operative form of ownership and management i include workers co-operatives of small businesses of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to look into the following matter which is a refinement of the question concerning mail delivery the following day or the day after <e> <s> if on week all mail that should be delivered in a particular day is so delivered at an hour before the recipient has left home for the day then that is very convenient <e> <s> however if on week the same mail is delivered four three or two hours after the recipient has departed then that is in effect delivering the mail a day later <e> <s> why therefore should someone one week receive one type of useful service and the following week a different type of service <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord heard what i have had to say and was not interrupted by the chief whip <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards part-time workers can the minister give the number of hours per day employed which constitute an additional person in terms of his figure of the addition to the number of employed people in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell me whether the press is correct in asserting that it is the reduction in regional aid which has enabled west germany to outbid the offer made by the welsh development agency to an american chip manufacturer who was going to invest in cwmbran no less than million leading to the creation of new jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the lack of competition may i ask yet another question <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister be good enough to look into this himself <e> <s> it is a serious allegation jobs are a lot of jobs <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say why he keeps on suggesting to the house that there is a method by which shareholders of an ordinary company can prevent a company making an individual political subscription other than by denying the company the right to have its accounts passed and placing the whole of the affairs of the company in chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accordingly support us when we come to the appropriate amendment in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the point of the noble earl rehearsing the arguments against the principle of joining when he has already told us that he is in favour of joining <e> <s> he is one of the principal members of the government <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that there is a huge body of expert opinion including the governor of the bank of england which has recommended that we should be joining the ems now <e> <s> what is the reason for further delay <e>", "<cs> i rise not to discuss the merits of the proposal because there are many other noble lords who are more capable of doing that than i and who no doubt will want their views to be heard but because i am very interested in the continual allegation unfortunately asserted in the first place by a minister on the front bench that this is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it is of little help to your lordships committee that such a suggestion should have been made and it shows little respect for the careful thought that has been given to this problem by all noble lords concerned front bench and back benches for a considerable period <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord had completed his remarks <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> if i may <e>", "<cs> i regret that i cannot support the sentiments that have just been expressed and which would virtually reduce your lordships house to a nullity so far as this committee stage is concerned <e> <s> we all know that we have a duty to improve a bill which has been passed by another place and not to reject it <e> <s> it is because of that that when the second reading of this bill recently came before your lordships house we were all extremely careful that no word was put on the order paper which would have delayed the passing of this bill by one moment <e> <s> an additional view was expressed which had no impact and no legal or other kind of effect on the way in which at the end of that days debate the government could and would be able to proceed with getting this bill on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> in a moment if i may just finish this part of my argument <e> <s> if it is a minor point it goes with the rest and the elector tends to vote for the leader for the general principles and for his understanding of the situation and not for a particular detailed clause <e> <s> therefore it remains our view that whether it is in the manifesto or not we are still committed in your lordships house by convention as indeed everything is by convention in your lordships house not to support an amendment which would <e>", "<cs> of course i agree <e> <s> it is on record that it is there <e> <s> i am saying that we have gone further than that and more to the noble lords liking if he follows my argument <e> <s> we have gone beyond that <e> <s> this house develops its procedure by convention and in my view it has developed by now a clear convention acceptable on both sides of the house that it does not vote against bills which have received a second reading in another place <e> <s> i say further that that convention applies whether or not that second reading was preceded by and therefore to a tiny extent supported by a previous statement in the partys manifesto <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has challenged me <e> <s> perhaps i may say that so far as all of us on these benches are concerned we have not once put our names to any amendment which would seek to delay the second reading of any bill passed by the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also very grateful to the leader of the house for being good enough to repeat this important statement <e> <s> it was a long statement but not very full of substantial content <e> <s> i will start by selecting those matters on which we should like to support the government fully in what they have been saying in this statement <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord seeks to withdraw his amendment i must insist on my own behalf and i hope that i am representing the view of many others that we need a good deal more guidance from the government than we have received so far <e> <s> let me explain why <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has said that this amendment is <e>", "<cs> may i say one word <e> <s> as the noble viscount the leader of the house is here he will be aware of the difficulties in which we are placed because the government insist on carrying on with the consideration of a bill after it has been amended in a fundamental way <e> <s> we have already had the extraordinary situation of an amendment being called and then being declared to be out of order after it had been called and spoken to <e> <s> we have had a government minister making a speech relevant to a situation which is no longer the case <e> <s> would it not have been better had the government considered their situation somewhat more carefully rather than to have put the committee into this difficulty <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did not explain to us on the basis that northern ireland adopted this system why he himself was not compelled to take the view that this system should apply to the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> of course he regards northern ireland as a special case <e> <s> and those who support this amendment regard ilea as a special case <e> <s> the committee are no more compelled to regard ilea as part of a system of proportional representation for the country as a whole than the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was compelled to regard northern ireland pr which i imagine he supported as pr for the whole of the country to which he is wholly opposed <e>", "<cs> nobody is suggesting that <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has no right to say that because one has proportional representation in a very limited and special case you must have proportional representation for the whole country <e> <s> everybody knows where we on these benches stand <e> <s> of course they do <e> <s> we support proportional representation throughout <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this is a very short intervention <e> <s> why does the noble lord a government minister keep on referring to what local authorities cannot do when he and his government in this house have just agreed that they can do it <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this a very complex and extremely expensive way of doing what the government could do so easily by keeping their mouths shut <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has completely avoided answering my supplementary question <e> <s> i apologise for upsetting the chief whip but i have to ask it again <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister say whether or not he considers it a very complex and expensive method of doing what it is within the governments power to do namely simply to stop interfering if that is what he said was the main argument fror privatising the gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are most grateful to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> although it is perfectly obvious and well established by now that the only possible advantage which can come from this exercise is to the governments coffers and that it follows on their well established procedure of scratching around for money wherever it can be found nevertheless this is perhaps not the occasion to dwell on that aspect but rather on the aspect of the number of shares issued and applied for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as an ex-treasury minister knows very well as indeed the whole house knows that there is no question of hypothecation <e> <s> what we are asking the government is why do they continue to sell capital assets and not invest in any capital construction in their place <e> <s> why are the government continually selling the silver to pay for the groceries <e>", "<cs> my lords if the procedure which the noble lord the minister recommends is acceded to is there not a danger that consumer affairs will tend to be overlooked <e> <s> is there not advantage in having consumer affairs dealt with every three months as a matter of routine to pick up matters which would not otherwise be dealt with <e> <s> finally are not all of us in this house grateful to my noble friend who keeps such a vigilant eye on these matters

this question and in view of the fact that they have already realised more than billion according to the minister and will no doubt realise a great deal more of the countrys national assets what will the government have to show by way of capital creation to replace those billions of pounds spent in this regrettable rakes progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not ask anything about electoral moods <e> <s> i asked what will the government have to show in terms of capital creation for this huge amount of national assets more than billion and possibly billion to billion which they will have realised and spent <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am sure that the noble lord lord wedderburn was going to ask the same question and i apologise for interfering could he give us the positive information which we are all waiting for of the evidence the noble lord has that moves of this kind which have taken place already have improved the situation <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord indicate where in the clause this is safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl remind us of the fall in the grant in real terms in the current year <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may preface my remarks in response to this statement with a very short tribute to a close friend and very distinguished politician who was a member of my party who passed away yesterday <e> <s> i refer to lord george-brown <e> <s> he was a close friend and your lordships will therefore forgive me for taking up the time of the house to express my profound admiration for a man of his great intellect his great capacity and his warm friendship <e>", "<cs> my lords with apologies to many members of your lordships house will the noble baroness and all her colleagues be good enough to dissociate herself and themselves from the use of the word disassociation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister help me in relation to something i cannot understand about current conservative policy <e> <s> will he explain why he always equates the rationalisation of operations with the need to cut labour rather than with the need to increase production <e> <s> if you have more production you use more labour <e> <s> as this falling off of orders could have been foreseen many months perhaps years ago i do not know but it did not arise suddenly could the minister tell us what steps were taken by british rail to seek different kinds of work not necessarily merely export orders in order to make use of the enormous skills of the people concerned and of the plant <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start by thanking the noble lord lord thorneycroft for the very moderate way in which he introduced a most important topic and gave us an opportunity to discuss what the theory was what the theory now is and how it is substantiated by what happens in practice as to transfers between public and private sectors in one way or the other <e> <s> he spoke with great moderation and with immense experience as we all know and if i may add to that with the wisdom of middle age <e> <s> we welcome all that <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble earl for everything that he said with regard to the theory of what we are discussing but i am bound to say that i draw a complete distinction between a discussion of the issues and an appraisal of the actions of the government and their motivation <e> <s> i shall come to that later on <e>", "<cs> my lords i really did not expect an argument of that kind <e> <s> the noble earl has used it before <e> <s> he is trying to equate public ownership with the

determined to discriminate against the issue of the noble viscount the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord shinwell who speaks on this

whatever of his seam running dry <e> <s> we have nugget after nugget and long may we continue to receive it <e> <s> the noble lord said and every speaker has so far said that this is an important

difficulty in ascertaining and discovering what similar salaries are paid for similar responsibilities to people working similar hours and which will create a normal and acceptable precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that motivation which is part of his definition does not depend on money alone <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that many of us feel that a little more open expression of appreciation of what the civil service does and a little less criticism would not come amiss from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord enlighten us a little as to what is the status of these teams <e> <s> are they set up as it were comparable to quangos or is this merely another example of the governments determination to insert an additional level of local

<e> <s> it is a wise practice and it enables us the better to read the document in question <e> <s> of course it means that those of us who have to deal with a statement and have had no time to read

lordships will forgive my saying that everything i have listened to has confirmed for me the wisdom of this amendment because everything that the government have said has been to misunderstand how to control public expenditure at which they are very bad and everything which noble lords behind have said has been based on some misapprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord the chairman of committees one question <e> <s> i am a member of the procedure committee <e> <s> when the noble lord said that the committee would be prepared to consider the matter again i take it that

form filling into getting orders looking after manufacturers and so on are of course welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an uninformed guess i put it no higher than that <e> <s> therefore one would want to be quite sure that the employees in a small firm the firm with a handful of staff a dozen or so people are fully protected and that there are not too many so-called removals of bureaucratic requirements <e> <s> is it not the case that these bureaucratic requirements were thought to be proper requirements at the time that they were instituted by one government or another <e> <s> i repeat

that we on these benches have every sympathy with the governments attempt to deal with the difficult matters necessary in order to complete the internal market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rising in support of the amendment and drawing your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a disgraceful statement when only a short time ago a minister from the front bench the noble lord lord young of

bound to draw this point to the attention of your lordships again because fortunately the proposal we are considering that we should now consider amendments comes immediately after two proposals which

without too much trouble according to precedent partly in the session in which it started and partly in a subsequent session <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches too are grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house for being good enough to repeat this important statement <e> <s> the first thing we want to do is to share in expressing our utter loathing of the system of apartheid

i may remind your lordships that i was recently making a speech in your lordships house which as i am a very modest man i thought was merely an average speech and to my great pleasure surprise and delight i found that the benches were filling up <e> <s> in due course it was standing room only and by the time i had reached the end of my speech believe it or not even standing room was fully taken

minister assure the house that the reason why this is moving at such a deplorably slow pace has nothing to do with the denial of the necessary funds to enable it to go faster <e>", "<cs> my lords has

associate ourselves with the appreciation that has been expressed to the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the position even more critical than was stated by my noble ally lord ezra <e> <s> what the noble lord the minister has told us is that the competition will rest in terms of the appeal to the market <e> <s> in other words he is not concerned about the first sale because as the statement says over the past years the government have been tailoring the accounts and the activities with a view to privatisation they have said so

amounts of capital and they will have to get it from the market <e> <s> they will have to satisfy the stock exchange that their shares should stand high so as to ensure new contributions by existing shareholders <e> <s> they will have to do that by making wide margins of profit in the future <e> <s> how is that consistent with a wholesome reliable and cheap supply of water to the consumer <e>",

charges between now and the time of privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord further on an essential matter that he has not found it possible to answer <e> <s> is he aware that what the whole house is interested to know is whether the negotiations which are still going on the details of which he naturally does not want to disclose are negotiations aimed at securing a take-over or at securing an amalgamation <e>", "<cs> my lords the theme of the speech made by my noble friend lord hanworth who raised this matter in the first place was not and it has been repeated by all other speakers to suggest the destruction of any of our democratic systems but their improvement through change and in particular to suggest that that change was due now if these systems were to endure <e>", "<cs> four i am delighted to say that that adds to the argument <e> <s> so far as i understand he has no manly sons <e> <s> he is a hereditary peer and his government choose to

minds of many of us on all sides of the house <e> <s> does the noble lord recollect that quite recently in their search for cash the government proceeded to sell to the private sector large sections of the defence-contracting industry and defended it on the grounds that the government could protect the national interest in relation to the possible transfer of shares to foreigners <e> <s> is the noble lord now satisfied and i am sure that this is the question which is in the minds of very many of us that the powers which the government have work fast enough to prevent industries which are vital to the defence of this country passing into foreign hands or partly so before he is aware of it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of these benches say how very much we appreciate the courtesy

question of mine <e> <s> i refer to the point that when general motors took over vauxhall the proportion of british content in the cars manufactured dropped from per cent <e> <s> to about per cent <e>

to try to pick out from the various comments that have been made some of the major themes on which we have centred and to which we should like the government to reply <e> <s> i must start at the beginning and say that though we are grateful to the noble lord lord young for coming when he could to deal with this debate and we fully understand that he could not stay i find it difficult to believe that his speech was a courtesy to the noble lord lord barnett who introduced this debate gave notice of it and made it clear in the wording of the motion that is down on the order paper that what your lordships would be invited to discuss and what the government would be invited to answer were questions relating to policy on oil production interest rates and exchange rates <e>", "<cs> my lords is that all that the noble lord is going to say about oil <e> <s> will he not give us any idea of what is the governments policy with regard to oil production <e> <s> is the noble lord saying

appreciate that he should allow me to respond <e> <s> he is talking about <e> <s> may i ask him quite specifically is he prepared to contradict what the noble lord lord young of graffham told me on th october that in there had been a rise in unit costs which is what matters in productivity in this country of per cent <e> <s> compared with a fall in germany of per cent <e> <s> and in japan of per cent <e> <s> so the margin was widened by something like to per cent <e> <s> in one year <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding what the noble lord has just said is he aware that there is in the country

who want to understand what is really happening which include the government and ourselves to be able to see the trend precisely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask for clarification <e> <s> i hope the house will accept that what i am seeking to do it to try to understand what the statisticians are proposing and the advice which has been accepted and therefore for which the minister is responsible and i am sure he understands himself <e> <s> if there is a three-week wait during that three-week period other people will be coming on to the register perfectly obviously and the figures

to my noble friend for having introduced it <e> <s> he introduced it by saying that he was going to look at these matters mainly from the point of view of a parliamentarian <e> <s> it is fitting

not directly relevant and pertinent to the question on the order paper that the minister should answer the question of the noble lord lord gladwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble baroness help an ordinary layman <e>", "<cs> my lords the question i was going to ask the noble baroness ties up very much with the question that has just been asked <e> <s> is it not the case that there is ample precedent for the government not relying upon crown immunity in cases where they do not think it proper so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords in his ante-penultimate answer the noble lord the minister was good enough to give the comparative figures for in cash terms <e> <s> can he now add the real terms <e>", "<cs> i should like to pursue what has already been started and follow exactly the theme established by the noble lord lord stoddart in his concluding comments <e> <s> this is indeed a most important bill <e> <s> it is a most difficult task on which we are now embarked <e> <s> i hope that your lordships realise that we are charged with the responsibility of doing something that i find immensely difficult <e> <s> we know what the government want <e> <s> they want to increase the efficiency of gas production <e> <s> they want to increase the protection of the consumer <e> <s> they propose to accomplish this by withdrawing all the accountability within the present set-up the accountability to parliament to government and to members of parliament who can put questions to ministers as well as the encouragement that exists in the present arrangements for producing gas at the minimum cost to the consumer <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the present chairman of the gas board who is not wholly hostile to this bill has taken the view that what the noble baroness lady macleod says is quite right <e> <s> if i may say so i am not aware that in speaking to the first amendment in a bill i am making a second reading speech <e> <s> i was not aware of that at all <e> <s> i am not concerned with the principles except to explain them as i have explained them and to explain why we are committed to them and why it is necessary for us to give effect to them <e> <s> i take the view that once the other place has passed a government bill we must accept the principles of that bill as embodied in the second reading <e> <s> at the time of the second reading we made <e>", "<cs> i am addressing the first amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord has the same marshalled list as i have <e> <s> i am addressing myself to amendment no <e> <s> which as the noble lord knows has three subsections and i am dealing with the last sentence of the first subsection <e> <s> i have not yet reached the second subsection <e> <s> therefore i do not know quite how the confusion arose in the noble lords mind but i am sure that it was my fault for not having made clear at the start that i was dealing only with subsection <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> it would be discourteous of me not to respond to and thank the noble lord the minister for his short attempt as he himself put it to deal with many of the arguments put forward from this side of the committee <e> <s> he seemed to indicate that there will be other occasions when he will reply more fully but he certainly dealt with some of the arguments and for that i am grateful <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lords on the government side who intervened because they have helped us enormously and i shall shortly come to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating the statement but it does not explain in any substantial way why there has been this change of ground <e> <s> why did the company and the government behind the company start negotiations to sell something and then decide that they were not going to sell <e> <s> would it not have been simpler not to have started upon this <e> <s> would that not have saved the anxiety that has been referred to and a lot of uncertainty <e> <s> would it not have saved employees the anxiety of not knowing what was happening to them <e> <s> why have the government suddenly decided that what they wanted to do a short time ago they no longer want to do <e> <s> is it because the bids were unattractive in size or is it because the government have returned to their senses <e> <s> we hope that it is the latter <e>", "<cs> it will come as no surprise to your lordships not only that i regret the response of the minister but that i wholeheartedly reject the snub he intends for this house and for the way in which committees of this house function <e> <s> i reject it on the basis of my experience <e> <s> the noble lord asked for people who were experienced in government and on appointments <e> <s> i had the privilege of being the first chairman of your lordships european committee and i gained experience of the way in which the government would listen and listen fully to the views of that committee and of its sub-committees which were based on evidence interviews and inquiries <e> <s> those views were not based on something taken off the top of ones head without being able to see the person <e>", "<cs> i shall gladly give way as soon as i have finished my point <e> <s> that is in the other house <e> <s> but we are not talking about the other house we are concerned with this chamber <e> <s>

shall remind the noble lord of what he did say and i am not proposing to withdraw one tittle of what i said <e> <s> the noble lord said that the present proposals do not involve committees of your lordships house in acts which are near political but that if this proposal were to be accepted they would come into political activity <e>", "<cs> what he was saying was that if this amendment were adopted the relevant or appropriate select committee would be acting politically <e> <s> your lordships heard him and that is the logical outcome of his remarks <e> <s> i repeat that i reject completely what he said on those arguments <e>", "<cs> they have all been turned down flat without any regard to their logic validity or value <e> <s> i do not know how many amendments the noble lord will accept so as to prove what he is now indicating <e> <s> we look forward to that very much <e>", "<cs> we have made it absolutely clear so far that as many noble lords have said the office of fair trading has a totally different function and has no parallel with what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord moves on to that other point perhaps he will be good enough to assist me <e> <s> i have been following very carefully what he has said about his experience on the select committee and that is very valuable <e> <s> would i be right in assuming that the majority of the members of the committee which came to the conclusion that he defined were supporters of the government <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it would be more convenient to wait for the noble lord the minister to reply or whether i should deal at the moment in a limited way with the questions which my noble friend lord whaddon has put to me which i am very happy to do <e>", "<cs> i shall give way to the noble lord gladly if he wishes to say something <e>", "<cs> indeed i shall <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may continue with what i was trying to explain before the noble lord the minister sought to delay progress by intervening in the way he did <e> <s> it was a very unhappy intervention if i may say so <e> <s> i may have been mistaken but i thought that the noble lord allowed a word to escape his lips which was quite unintentional <e> <s> i thought he used the word filibuster <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord when he has had an opportunity of reading <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for such attention as he felt able to pay to the arguments which we put forward in supporting this particular amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for drawing attention to the fact that we on these benches are prepared to discuss the matter with great objectivity no matter whether or not it results in differences of view <e> <s> i am delighted that my noble friend lord whaddon who has far greater experience in this field than i was so impressed by the weight of experience skills and ability that would fall upon the proposed regulator that he felt that even the process of consultation could not necessarily be carried out in one meeting of the select committee <e>", "<cs> i do not know what has happened to ministers these days and i also do not know what has happened to the normal courtesies which apply <e> <s> as i was saying two or three minutes ago i do not know what has happened in these latter days but i hope very much that the government will accept

you on this side of the chamber thank god <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting more than that <e> <s> i was not putting any words into the ministers mouth <e> <s> we on this side have to take what small crumbs of comfort we can <e> <s> we know that we are in a situation in which whenever they want to do so the conservative opposition can vote out any proposal we put forward <e> <s> we realise that full well <e> <s> we know that whatever the merits of the argument we cannot convince the committee if they are not here to listen to the arguments but if they come in in droves and vote us <e>", "<cs> is that a year or is it a century <e>", "<cs> i understand it would be for the convenience of the committee that amendments nos <e> <s> to should be discussed together <e> <s> i was proposing to follow on what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> not at all i think we understand that <e> <s> i hope it will be for the convenience of the committee if i now rise to explain but not to move the amendment standing in my name and the extent to which it differs from the amendment which has already been moved <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i followed every word he said and i am grateful to him for intervening <e> <s> it is obvious that he speaks with knowledge of the subject and if i may say so with respect he is equally right in his conclusions with regard to business as he is in his conclusions with regard to politics and ministers <e> <s> may i ask him therefore what objection he has to the form of words used in the second amendment in particular a full knowledge in which the other requirements are deliberately not excluded <e> <s> what objection would he have to a form of words of that kind which are not restrictive in any way <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord and ask him to clear up a point which is very relevant to what he has said but which is beyond my knowledge <e> <s> he referred to an annex which i do not have with me although that is my fault i know <e> <s> i take it he is not referring to a schedule but to an annex <e> <s> i ask him therefore what is the status of that annex <e> <s> is it to be attached to the bill <e> <s> is it to be used for guidance <e> <s> is it <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that the noble baroness is making <e> <s> we are on the same point <e> <s> we would have preferred a commission of at least three commissioners <e> <s> they might have been able to do the job <e> <s> we might then not have had need of any of these amendments we are considering <e> <s> but as we are now considering one individual we do not hesitate to say that that one individual shall have in particular one qualification <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the answer of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> it was short in length and short in content very short indeed <e> <s> i understand the first i do not understand the second <e> <s> i do not understand why the noble lord does not feel that he has to justify resisting the fifth amendment running five out of five <e> <s> according to my arithmetic <e>", "<cs> i do not know why the noble lord says no <e> <s> would he like to explain that <e> <s> no he would not <e> <s> we are providing a committee because we <e>", "<cs> i should like to support very strongly the amendment that has been moved so persuasively by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and to explain why we on these benches welcome it as an attempt to do what we ourselves failed to do which was to persuade the committee that the present arrangement was wholly unsatisfactory and unlikely to achieve the purposes of the government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does know <e> <s> it is written in the bill which he has read <e> <s> the noble lord said and if he said it no doubt it is true that he was here until five to eleven on thursday night <e> <s> is that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a slight attack of impatience but i shall give way if he wants me to <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord said that <e> <s> i heard him <e> <s> but they are of high calibre and low status <e> <s> what we are concerned with is people who have the status or very close to the status of the director general himself people who can impress by their ability and by their status by the number of pips <e> <s> we are all familiar with that <e> <s> we do not regard a general as being well i shall not pursue it i have no need <e> <s> everybody understands the position <e> <s> a man of status acting on his own is likely to be strengthened if he has

to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press the amendment unduly but i have difficulty in understanding what the minister said by way of explanation <e> <s> after all the subsection says <e>", "<cs> we are all concerned with having clear legislation <e> <s> this subsection is as clear as a bell <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has misunderstood me out of his zeal to support the government <e> <s> i am not suggesting necessarily these words at all <e> <s> if the government prefer the words suggested by my noble friend reasonable notice that is all right too <e> <s> it is not the case that the secretary of state cannot get rid of an undesirable director <e> <s> the next few lines in the bill provide for that <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is as courteous as usual and if he does that he will give us the necessary reassurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> courtesy requires that i should answer the three questions which the noble lord has put to me but perhaps i may precede that by answering the points that the noble lord lord somers has just made <e>", "<cs> i understand that <e> <s> i had thought that i had heard the noble lord lord somers correctly but i may well not have done so <e> <s> but i am sure that i heard the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter correctly <e> <s> he put to me three questions <e> <s> he asked me first of all which committee was involved when we were talking about appropriate committee <e> <s> i am sorry that he has asked me that because he made clear that he was here for the whole of our first days proceedings when of course i went over this matter not at great length but at sufficient length i thought to explain it <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord does not want to hold us up on little details of that kind <e> <s> we are anxious to get on with the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord at a later stage wants to introduce an amendment saying for committee read or sub-committee we should welcome that <e> <s> it would be easily disposed of <e>", "<cs> i want to make clear that i am not talking about incapacity or misbehaviour as they are the subject of two later amendments when we shall be seeking proper clarification and will discuss the matter fully <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the noble lord the minister thought it necessary to bring that point into the argument because he will then accuse us of repeating it when we come to deal with it again later <e> <s> on that same tack may i on behalf of the noble lords lord sandys and lord boyd-carpenter reject completely his allegation that they were speaking in order to hold up the business <e> <s> it is far from that <e> <s> both noble lords had constructive speeches to make <e> <s> i do not necessarily agree with them but i hope that the noble lord the minister will not say that the purpose of a committee stage is to prevent any member on his side of the chamber speaking just as he cannot prevent us from speaking <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord notices the clock <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wants to attribute that title to himself he must be free to do so <e>", "<cs> i find that answer most disappointing and not all that straighforward <e> <s> i asked specifically for a legal precedent and the noble lord has not answered that question at all <e> <s> he quoted two statutory precedents <e> <s> i spent considerable time explaining to the noble lord why those so-called statutory precedents were not precedents <e> <s> does the noble lord really want me to go over all that ground again <e> <s> i explained exactly why in our view they were <e>", "<cs> i feel very unhappy indeed with the reply from the noble lord the minister <e> <s> perhaps i may stretch the meaning of an english word to use it in regard to what he said <e> <s> i prefer to call his reply a statement <e> <s> he read out his brief <e> <s> that is fine <e> <s> of course we are interested in hearing what his brief said but i asked him two specific questions to which we had no answer whatever <e> <s> those questions are absolutely crucial to the action we must take on this amendment <e> <s> is it or is it not the right of every man and woman who is employed to go to an industrial trubunal if they want to argue that they have been unfairly dismissed <e>", "<cs> i should like first of all to thank the noble lord the minister for his customary courtesy in giving us a full and very helpful answer <e> <s> i am only sorry that he did not give it in the first place because then i should not have needed to ask him the question again <e> <s> indeed it is plain to the committee that had i not stood up a second time we would not have obtained this most valuable information <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for it <e> <s> it makes clear the value of what the committee is presently engaged in which is digging into the meaning of an act to find out whether we are acting justly <e> <s> clearly we are not <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> that is the case <e> <s> it was only discovered as the noble lord will recollect as a result of our deep investigation <e> <s> the committee did not know that until it was revealed by question and answer <e> <s> it has now been clarified <e> <s> we are aware therefore that there is this importance attached to his appointment <e> <s> as an ordinary layman i regard it as employment and the man himself as being an employee <e> <s> of course i do <e> <s> it never occurred to me when i put down the amendment that the director was not an employee and therefore not entitled to have this right and this freedom that is given to every citizen who is an employee <e> <s> i am bound to say that this is a right that we should unquestionably insist upon <e>", "<cs> i always listen with great care and sympathy to what the noble lord lord marshall of leeds says if only for the fact that he comes from leeds and must therefore be right <e>

<e> <s> under the bill as it stands he has the right to appeal to the courts <e> <s> it does not say so <e> <s> one does not have to say it either in the bill or in the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> if the man commits a crime he will be properly sacked <e> <s> and if he is put in a lunatic asylum for the obvious reason he will be regarded as totally unfit to do his job and

embarrassed the other night when it was made evident that they had not even kept the committee together i shall not make any challenge <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we cannot let this clause go without expressing our anxieties that it should have been left in the bill in exactly the same form in which it was first printed for the other place <e> <s> it has remained unaltered by the other place although there was no guillotine in committee at this stage with some four or five sittings on clause <e>", "<cs> before the question is put there is one further question that i should like to address to the minister and i think that it would be best to put it to him at this stage <e> <s> it is entirely up to the committee whether i raise the question at this stage or later but <e>", "<cs> unfortunately i did not hear the whole of that exchange <e> <s> what i was going to ask the noble lord the minister was whether he would be good enough to give us some information at this stage so that we can turn the matter over in our minds and know how to deal with it when we get to the later stages of the bill <e> <s> it has been made absolutely clear and the noble lord lord marshall of leeds has reinforced it that the interim chairman will be appointed by the government <e> <s> therefore the government must know what range of salary they have in mind for that individual <e>", "<cs> that is the whole purpose of putting down the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble viscount because that enables me to explain what i have already explained <e> <s> i must repeat it because the minister did not take on board why we put down these amendments and what we are seeking to ascertain <e> <s> it is not a question of my having no idea of what a deputy secretary earns <e> <s> that is not the position <e> <s> i thought and the noble lord has confirmed this with regard to the staff but not with regard to the director general that the government were taking the view that it would save a lot of trouble if these appointments were aligned with civil service appointments <e> <s> so far as <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful to the noble lord the minister for the information that he has given <e> <s> i think he could easily assist us a little further without prejudicing the situation <e> <s> he has made clear that the first steps have already been taken in advertising this position i am referring to the position of director general <e> <s> therefore the government must have taken the usual steps of discussions between departments including the treasury if i may say so and if my recollection serves me aright <e> <s> they will have taken steps to agree upon the level of remuneration or the kind of remuneration at which they are aiming <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can give some indication without prejudicing the position of what is the precise figure that is being offered on the basis of the exact qualities of the candidate who comes forward <e> <s> perhaps he can give an indication between two figures of what he has in mind <e> <s> that would be very helpful indeed <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord is able to do that having regard to what he said about an advertisement having already been placed <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord for the information that he has given <e> <s> it has made discussion on this amendment worthwhile <e> <s> we will come back to it at the appropriate clause in the bill <e> <s> no doubt by that time further steps will have been taken and the government will not be so coy about <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting <e> <s> the noble lord could have used the words was practically never <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> of course we can all imagine the different circumstances <e> <s> however the noble lord said earlier that there were various precedents <e> <s> therefore i assume that he has in mind particular cases where particular amounts of compensation were paid <e> <s> will he give us some indication of the type of circumstances where compensation has been paid in this kind of situation <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord the minister for the helpful way in which he has indicated that he will disclose these precedents so as to enable us at a later stage in the bill to make an assessment of whether the public interest is being properly protected and indeed the interest of the director general as well <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why i was pressing that question at this point <e>", "<cs> i say as kindly as i can that the noble lord has failed completely to take on board the point of the amendment <e> <s> we are not in conflict on the substance of it <e> <s> there is no issue between us on what is proposed <e> <s> it is merely the way that it is described <e> <s> i repeat that it is not a question of anything additional being said <e> <s> it is nothing to do with that <e> <s> the whole thing has to be taken together so that it will read as i have already indicated <e>", "<cs> i am grateful <e> <s> i shall certainly respond to that invitation <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord has the same marshalled list as i have <e> <s> the amendment which i read out is no <e>", "<cs> i see the difficulty that the noble lord is in <e> <s> i think that it is perfectly plain what amendment is required <e> <s> i think that it is perfectly plain from the marshalled list which words are to be left out which correspond exactly with the argument that i have put before the committee as to how this paragraph should read <e> <s> i think it would be infinitely better if the words are so set out <e> <s> i should be grateful if in the meantime the minister would be good enough to consult his advisers as to how this paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the attention he has given to this amendment and i am sorry that he has not been able to meet us further than he has done <e> <s> perhaps i may first say to the noble lord lord bruce of donington that of course i understand his reason for preferring the affirmative resolution of the other place to the affirmative resolution of both houses because it is the other place that is primarily concerned with a financial matter of this kind <e> <s> nevertheless it would be breaking very new ground indeed to have an affirmative resolution made by one house alone and i suspect that many members of the committee would feel that it was not paying sufficient regard to the experience and wisdom of your lordships house which has a special position with regard to affirmative resolutions which as we know are not covered by the parliament act <e> <s> so that is the reason why as a first shot but only as a first shot i drafted the amendment on the lines that the secretary of state would recommend and that an affirmative resolution of each house would approve <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches would like to pay our tribute and i would start by echoing everything that has been said so far so felicitously by both the leader of the house and the leader of the labour party <e> <s> it is very difficult indeed nigh impossible to pay anything like an adequate tribute to such a great man in the time which your lordships consider would be appropriate when his lifespan was so enormous his experience so varied and his qualities so great <e> <s> it really is only possible to pick out one or two things and to remember him by those <e> <s> if i were asked one thing by which i would remember him it was his doggedness in fighting for fairness for his fellow man throughout his life from the beginning in very difficult circumstances in the east end of london through scotland and back to england fighting the whole time <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly pursue the amendment and rest my case on what the noble lord the minister has just said <e> <s> he said that the number of staff can be determined only by the director in due course <e> <s> that is exactly the view that we take the number can be determined only by the director <e> <s> he is the person who knows and who if the bill remains in its present form will make recommendations which the treasury may turn down and will turn down if the pressure on public expenditure remains as great as it is at the moment when hospitals education and everything else one can think of are suffering <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers reply encouraging in one respect but unsatisfactory in many others <e> <s> i must delay the committee for a moment or two to give some of the evidence which has reached me and which apparently has not reached some noble lords on the other side <e>", "<cs> having regard to the fact that the minister has already said that the amendment in the name of the noble baroness is not acceptable in its present form will the noble lord accept from me that that amendment will not be moved that therefore if the noble lord chooses to divide on this amendment he will not prejudice in the slightest what the minister has said and that we should be happy to support him <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he has outlined what is the practice <e> <s> he does not like this amendment and none of us expects our amendments to be perfect but as that is the practice both past and continuing is there any reason why the minister should not bring forward an amendment which is acceptable to the government to cover by statute what is to take place <e>", "<cs> i understand that argument and i am grateful to the minister for his patience in coming back to this <e> <s> however i am really asking him if there is any reason why what he says has been the practice and will continue to be the practice should not be incorporated in statute in words that are acceptable to him <e> <s> if that can be done at a future stage there is no problem whatever and perhaps the minister will indicate that he is prepared to consider that <e> <s> there may be difficulties <e> <s> i do not take the view that all of us possess all wisdom when speaking off the top of our heads at any one moment <e> <s> i certainly do not take that view <e> <s> i shall be grateful if the minister will consult his advisers to see whether there is any way of incorporating in the bill what he says will be the continuing practice so that it will not rest on the say-so of the minister but on a section in the statute <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble lord the minister had to say <e> <s> he has been helpful in saying that the process of consultation and giving effect to what is in the bill has already started and that therefore there is unlikely to be the kind of gap that i feared <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for accentuating the point about which we are concerned <e> <s> in his first speech the minister said that there was unlikely to be a gap of more than two weeks <e> <s> he indicated a period of about two weeks <e> <s> we do not see why there should be any gap at all <e> <s> the whole takeover is based on the old finishing one day and the new starting the next <e> <s> accounts are being prepared on that basis <e> <s> the old accounts

pleasant compliment to ones own amendment if other names are added to it particularly from the other side of the committee <e> <s> i have never heard i am sorry if it is my fault of the practice that it is normal to seek the permission of the person in whose name an amendment is before adding ones own name <e>", "<cs> i think that the amendment before the committee at the moment is an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> that is to say amendment <e>", "<cs> i hesitate always but particularly in this case to suggest that perhaps my amendment has not been fully understood <e> <s> therefore as it cannot be that it must be that the amendment does not mean what i think it means <e> <s> the amendment was intended to make it absolutely clear that the treasury retains the right of approval regarding terms and conditions of service which if i may say so is not quite what the minister seemed to be understanding <e> <s> i hope i repeat that the amendment makes that absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to delay the committee but of course the noble lord the minister is right it was mentioned several times when i was chief secretary <e> <s> what i am seeking to do as i have said on previous occasions is drawing on six long years of experience as chief secretary to distinguish between those parts of the treasurys duties which are inevitable and therefore have to be accepted and those parts which are not inevitable <e> <s> therefore there is no need for a treasury minister to irritate all his colleagues by exercising this kind of veto unnecessarily <e>", "<cs> i have to take that disappointing answer in conjunction with the many helpful replies which the minister has given and to accept that he is not pursuing the tactic which was previously apparently being pursued of brushing aside every amendment no matter what was its content <e> <s> i must take that into account and thank the minister for the consideration given so far <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain to the government front bench that two amendments have not been moved so that a short discussion can take place on schedule stand part this being a shorter way of dealing with the two problems <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that clarification <e>", "<cs> i understand that it is to the convenience of the committee that this amendment should be discussed with the following amendment no <e> <s> a which is in my name and which proposes instead of the affirmative resolution proposed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington who moved the amendment prior to this one the negative form as being sightly less onerous <e> <s> let me make it absolutely clear that i would have preferred the amendment which has just been moved by the noble lord lord bruce of donington but the government have given no sign that they are prepared to move in the way that we think they should and therefore this is a second but less-favoured alternative <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for reminding me about that <e> <s> i did not mention it but i said that my argument refers not only to financing immediately but financing in the future and equally it refers to financing not only from internal sources but also from external sources <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord although courteous as usual has not devoted his mind to the argument at all <e> <s> he certainly has not persuaded us <e> <s> we want to make as much progress as we can on the bill <e> <s> we are moving our amendments so far as we do move them and are not withdrawing them we have withdrawn many amendments and motions on <e>", "<cs> i think the minister has said something relevant to the amendment that i moved <e> <s> he said that there would be a cushion if it enabled inefficient suppliers to carry on their business <e> <s> but i do not see anywhere in this clause and i do not know where else it is in the bill that the secretary of state and the director have the powers to prevent this kind <e>", "<cs> there is a reference to efficiency <e> <s> we shall consider that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving me that information <e> <s> in those circumstances i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hesitate before speaking because there is another name attached to this amendment and i did not wish to prevent full discussion <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he has given me the very information that i sought <e> <s> i shall consider it very carefully in relation to the references to the various clauses when i see it in <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say very shortly that though i am most grateful to the minister for having drawn our attention to areas or clauses in the bill where discussion of these matters can perhaps more appropriately take place and for that we are very grateful it would really be helpful if he himself would <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us the extent of the consultations that is with which bodies they will be held <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not right in assuming from one reference in the reply of the noble lord the minister that the table will be based both on current prices and on real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a disgraceful answer when the figures have been published <e> <s> is it not unfortunate that the noble lord the minister seeks the whole time to avoid giving the true facts never disclosing the number of part-time jobs <e> <s> is it not the case that figures have been published on european comparable bases comparing like with like in all countries and that they show that out of the relevant countries have unemployment at a lower percentage than this country and only three the three the noble lord mentioned have unemployment at a higher rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is obviously quite right <e> <s> i did not attempt to rise until the government had said something as to the authority the propriety and the accuracy of the statement which is being referred to <e> <s> i do not propose to indulge in an individual argument with an individual noble lord on the other side but i was hoping that the government would say something <e> <s> if what the government had to say disposed of the matter there would be no need to say anything further <e> <s> if what the government had to say did not dispose of the matter then it might be necessary to delay your lordships a moment or two <e>", "<cs> it is in the proposed authorisation <e>", "<cs> those of us on these benches are undoubtedly grateful to the noble lord the minister for the consideration which he has given to the arguments which have been put forward and for his <e>", "<cs> all right it is the second crumb i do not want to be unjust <e> <s> we are grateful for that reconsideration but we must make it absolutely clear that when we come to the report stage we shall have to think very carefully indeed about whether the extra protection to which all of us referred is adequately provided for in what the noble lord proposes <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to comment <e>", "<cs> it only falls to me to say once more that we are grateful to the minister but the more one considers it the more one realises that perhaps i was being over generous in saying that he has given us half a loaf <e> <s> the expression a crumb is a better evaluation of the size <e> <s> however we shall look carefully at this and await what the noble lord has to put on the marshalled list at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what she wants to do about this amendment i should like to say how very much we on these benches appreciate what the minister has just said and particularly his understanding that producing something to be put in the statute will have a very important effect on our thinking <e> <s> we are very grateful to him and of course if the noble baroness wants to pursue the matter i always support her whatever she does but i hope that she might feel as i do that the minister has gone a very long way indeed on this issue <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that i understand from what the minister has been good enough to say that he will consider the whole position including as it were the transfer of this condition from the authorisation into the statute itself to which we on these benches attach great importance as i think does the noble lord lord williams also <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for the very full and courteous way in which he dealt with the amendment <e> <s> in particular i want to thank him for agreeing with my main point or at all events for not disagreeing with my main point <e> <s> that main point related to the change of <e>", "<cs> i am awfully sorry that is just no good <e> <s> if what the noble lord says is right all that the director can call for is information that will not produce the answer for which we are asking <e> <s> that will be no help whatsoever to the director or the customer at large <e> <s> i am sorry this is a reasonable request <e> <s> it is put upon us by the fact that the government have decided to make a private monopoly of the supply of gas to those million tariff customers <e> <s> that is the change <e> <s> it is the governments desire that there should be that change <e> <s> it is our desire that there should be the minimum protection of knowing whether out of that activity an excessive profit is being made <e>", "<cs> yes because the noble lord is not addressing himself to the question to which i am addressing my mind <e> <s> i am not at the moment concerned with cross-subsidisation <e> <s> we shall come to that on a later amendment <e> <s> we are not asking at the moment about whether the contract customer pays through the nose <e> <s> will the ordinary man in the street who will have to buy his goods at the one shop be taken to town <e> <s> will an excessive profit be made out of that one activity <e> <s> we shall know the answer and those million consumers will be protected only if we know the final tally <e> <s> there will be all sorts of protections <e>", "<cs> one of the strengths of the committee is the great variety and depth of experience that is brought to bear from time to time by noble lords <e> <s> listening as we all have to the wise words of the noble lord lord stoddart is bound to impress everyone in the committee as it has impressed me of the great understanding and depth of experience he has in these matters <e> <s> i say that because not always are we all able to speak out of our own knowledge and experience <e> <s> we each have knowledge in some fields but those of us who have to carry out this task of reviewing legislation often have to speak on matters on which inevitably we do not have first-hand <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i apologise to the committee and say that i did not see that undertaking in the course of the fairly wide reading that i undertook before proposing certain amendments in this chamber <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister direct me to the place in the bill where this undertaking is couched <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the consideration he has given to the point <e> <s> he has clearly taken the point that this is a matter of concern for a lot of potential competitors which arises out of the action of the government in creating this very large very powerful and very monopolistic concern <e> <s> what the minister is really saying is that when we get to clause we shall be capable of being satisfied that the very thing we want is there <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to everybody who has participated in the debate on this important amendment <e> <s> i am particularly grateful because everybody is of one mind <e> <s> everybody including the minister is clear that it is wise to engage in long-term research and development programmes <e> <s> everybody is clear as to the wisdom of that <e> <s> the question that arises is whether it is necessary to incorporate that in a clause in the bill <e> <s> that is the only question <e>", "<cs> it is because i can and it is because i believe it to be in the national interest that british gas plc should have a measure of encouragement that it is necessary for this amendment to be pursued <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord because as the noble viscount lord trenchard has done he has put forward a picture of this private monopoly being in total competition with other industries <e> <s> he is talking about ordinary commercial organisations which are in daily competition <e> <s> he is trying to compare those with a private monopoly which has total sole monopolistic power <e> <s> i cannot put it too strongly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the full answer that he gave in regard to the amendment which i moved and i am grateful to all those who contributed to this discussion <e> <s> normally when a minister says that everything that is being asked for is to be found in the bill a mover of an amendment will be wise to say well i am very grateful <e> <s> i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i will consider very carefully what has been said and will look into it <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether other noble lords may wish to contribute to this discussion <e> <s> i want to say one or two words about this clause because it is a most important and very large clause to which we are now saying goodbye <e> <s> i think it right to say that we on these benches are grateful to the government for the concessions made on some points which we put forward <e> <s> there are however one or two questions arising and i thought it would save the time of the committee if instead of putting down an amendment i asked a question at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in fact i was slightly misunderstood <e> <s> i was not asking any question about the efficiency factor <e> <s> i was merely saying that we have the efficiency factor which is some deterrent to the increase in overhead charges such as top level salaries <e> <s> but not a sufficient deterrent <e> <s> the effect is that these increases which the noble lord has indicated may well happen will simply be passed on to the consumer as i feared was the case <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he hinted and would ask him whether he would go just a hit further <e> <s> we do not want to press this when there is uncertainty about it but perhaps the minister would merely say that he will look at the words to make sure that the drafting is right that it means what he wishes it to mean and that all the words are necessary <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i did not move amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> i did not move amendment no <e> <s> b for the good reason that on the document suggesting which items should be taken together it was not mentioned <e> <s> i did not wish to interrupt the noble lord the minister <e> <s> one does not do that because it would be a discourtesy <e> <s> he may have been briefed to answer both amendments <e> <s> i want to move that amendment <e> <s> it relates to a separate point and i want a separate answer <e> <s> i hope therefore that this discussion can be brought back as i originally intended to refer only to amendment no <e> <s> a and we can discuss amendment no <e> <s> b later <e>", "<cs> i shall deal only with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i thank the noble lord the minister for what he said <e> <s> i was not clear about what he said <e> <s> may i ask him whether i understood him correctly and that when he considers what should be incorporated in the undertaking that he has already given with regard to introducing something into clause he will take into account not only what was said at that stage but will also take into account what could not have been taken into account then because we ad not reached it and what has now been said <e> <s> i ask for no more than that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has been most helpful <e> <s> in those circumstances we get back to the position where we can say that we shall look carefully at what the minister produces in the very relevant clause <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway will forgive me for saying as i am no lawyer that i had no desire to be more royalist than the king <e> <s> if the governments legal advisers thought it unnecessary to spell out what he thinks it necessary to spell out i had rather left it at that <e> <s> we shall be listening carefully to what he has to say <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is a reasonable response <e> <s> he has taken the essential point <e> <s> we want to see the provision in the statute so far as we can achieve that <e> <s> what he proposes for clause will be by its nature a statutory provision <e> <s> he has been good enough to say certain things <e> <s> i shall not even attempt to reiterate what he said because i do not want to add to it or detract from it <e> <s> we heard what he said <e> <s> we are grateful to him <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the very full answer which he gave in the first place <e> <s> i assume that the noble lord with his usual courtesy when he writes to the noble lord lord bruce of donington will be good enough to send me a copy of his letter <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy that the contribution that has just been made by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes touches the problem raised in this amendment <e> <s> of course there is a problem of people moving from address to address and that has created as the noble baroness said a continuing and regular problem to which no solution has been found <e> <s> but just as she is anxious that the innocent should not pay for the defects of the guilty by having too small a deposit we are anxious that the same thing should not happen through those who are in permanent residence having to pay for those who move from residence to residence and deliberately try to avoid payment of their gas bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord responds further and i am grateful to him for indicating that he is about to say something more would he be good enough to say not merely what his view is but why his view is that six months is better than three months <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what he said previously <e> <s> he said that the governments view is that six months is better than three months <e> <s> that is a very interesting statement but it is devoid of any argument <e> <s> what we are interested to hear is the argument as to why six months is better than three months <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness knows what she is talking about <e>", "<cs> i did not deal with anything beyond amendment no <e> <s> a because the list that has been circulated shows amendment no <e> <s> a on its own <e>", "<cs> we have thought that on several occasions <e>", "<cs> no i am sorry but i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord the minister has said and i am sure that on this occasion he is reading the right brief <e> <s> even so i cannot see that he has given any kind of careful consideration to the main point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> no no i am not tetchy at all <e>", "<cs> i am just inviting the noble lord the minister to share in the joy that we all have in discussing amendments on the gas bill at five minutes past five in the morning <e> <s> the minister is absolutely right <e> <s> these amendments were put down only yesterday and the reason for that is that it was the first day back after the recess <e>", "<cs> no i am listening <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have not been able to impress the point on the noble lord the minister though i have tried twice <e> <s> he says that there is no role and that is all up to the director <e> <s> there is no earthly reason why though the director has the final responsibility the consumers council should not be brought into consultation <e> <s> i am not giving a role to the consumers council in the sense of making it an authority on this matter or giving it a power to fix the rate <e> <s> i am suggesting in this amendment that the consumers council should be consulted <e> <s> consulting means before the final decision is made <e> <s> it should be told what is likely to happen so that it can make representations if necessary and those can be listened to and taken into account <e> <s> there is no question of the directors role being reduced or the consumer councils role being changed into fixing the rate <e> <s> it is one of being consulted <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord the minister is trying to be helpful but i do not consider that remark helpful <e> <s> we are considering this bill <e> <s> we are a chamber of parliament exercising its function on a point upon which the other chamber has been denied the possibility of exercising its function <e> <s> we are deciding on the shape of a piece of legislation <e> <s> it is legislation which involves the fixing of a tariff <e> <s> i shall read out the provision <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to take part in this discussion because i had the privilege of discussing an earlier amendment on much the same point <e> <s> but if i am not mistaken i fear that the minister is misleading the committee <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have to come back to this point but a short time ago when i asked the noble lord the minister whether it was the case that under clause the tariff was fixed by the gas supplier he said yes it was fixed by the gas supplier but under clause it was the director who fixed it <e> <s> that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i am waiting for the noble lord the minister to say whether or not the gas supplier fixes the tariff <e> <s> if he has got it wrong and in fixing the tariff has contravened a certain condition we all know that under clause the director has certain powers <e> <s> it is a simple question <e> <s> who fixes the tariff <e> <s> in clause it says in plain english that it is the gas supplier <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> this is the point at which any lack of clarity in a bill is generally raised by the opposition and explained by the government <e> <s> in clause we have a very good example of lack of clarity <e> <s> i refer to subsections and which refer to the fixing of the tariff <e> <s> i thank the minister in particular for his courtesy in supplying notes on clauses which have been very valuable to opposition members in trying to understand in more simple language the meaning of a bill <e> <s> other members of the committee will no doubt have received the notes on clauses <e> <s> the note on subsection reads as follows <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point is he going to be able to tell us for certain whether x will be converted into this particular figure by the time we get to report stage so that we will know then where we are <e>", "<cs> if i could say a word in response to what the noble lord the minister has said we are very grateful to him for that very full explanation and indeed we are grateful to the noble lord for moving the amendment in such plain terms <e>", "<cs> i was about to make that very suggestion <e> <s> i shall move the amendment very briefly because it is not so very different from the amendment which has recently been discussed <e> <s> it was i understand thought that had amendment no <e> <s> been moved it would be for the convenience of the committee if amendments nos <e> <s> a aa b and c were also discussed at the same time <e> <s> therefore i propose to follow that course <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the consideration he has given and for his full reply in particular having regard to the fact that we had a similar discussion only a short time ago <e> <s> i know he will acquit me of any attempt to be unfair <e> <s> he said it was rather unfair that we were having a second go <e> <s> we were not consulted as to any possible grouping with the earlier amendments <e> <s> had we been i would have consented readily because of the similarity of the substance <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord also let us know what the effect of the hard winter has been on the british native birds <e> <s> before he answers that this is not the same question may i say to him that i have always understood that there is quite a relationship between the bees and the birds <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i do not find the ministers answers for the present provision in the bill at all satisfactory <e> <s> what is proposed in this amendment among other things is that certain-activities shall be free of charge <e> <s> i hope we can avoid the confusion concerning the point at which the supplier becomes responsible and the point at which the problem relates to the apparatus and so on <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said and if i may say so i think he was in error that the bill provides for this work to be done free <e> <s> can he rather than just relying on generalities in words point out to me where in this bill it says that it shall be provided free of charge <e>", "<cs> what i asked some time ago is where does it say that <e> <s> we all understand that the licence says it is free we all understand that the present practice is to provide the service free and we all understand therefore that to put it in a statute is by no means an imposition because it is being done already and is accepted as a responsible attitude and in the best interests of a commercial organisation <e> <s> so i am repeating to the noble lord the minister that either he has to admit that the bill does not give authority for this service to be provided free or to show us where in the bill we can see the words free of charge <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we are by no means out of the wood <e> <s> first of all perhaps i may direct the noble lord to the bill itself because he has some hesitation in referring to it <e> <s> we are talking about paragraph and the prevention of escapes of gas <e> <s> the last line of sub-paragraph to which i draw his attention states <e>", "<cs> i was merely going to ask the noble lord whether when he went to the relevant authority he said i am sorry i cannot tell a lie <e> <s> it was my fault <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister but can he explain when there is already a statutory obligation upon the gas supplier to carry out this duty free of charge why the government have found it necessary in the authorisation to use the very words that we are seeking to put in the bill <e> <s> if it is so clear why does it have to be put in the authorisation <e>", "<cs> i apologise but the noble lord has said that it is not necessary at all because there is a statutory obligation upon the public gas supplier to carry out this duty free of charge <e> <s> it is a statutory obligation it is not necessary to mention it <e> <s> if it is not necessary to mention it at all why is it in the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is the late chairman of the coal board <e> <s> i mean late in the sense of ex-chairman or if members of the committee would prefer it in the sense that he has just participated as most of us have in an all night sitting <e> <s> i am saying that he has that experience with the coal board <e> <s> if somebody as closely associated with the fuel industry was not automatically aware of the new interpretation which the noble lord seeks to put on that provision it is not surprising that others are in the same difficulty and i was not aware of it and still do not accept it <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have made it clear to the noble lord that i do not desire to go endlessly down the route of dividing the committee i desire to make progress on the bill <e> <s> i desire to enable the noble lord the minister to give us some indication as to whether we shall see some improvement in the bill at its final stage <e> <s> we have a long long way to go <e> <s> we are only halfway through the committee stage <e> <s> we have the report stage and third reading to come <e>", "<cs> i want to speak for one minute only to add my support to the amendment and to respond to the interesting comment made by the noble lord the minister about using best endeavours to resolve complaints <e> <s> i am bound to make this comment because what he referred to was an amendment of mine about standing charges <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the sympathetic and understanding response of the minister <e> <s> did i gather him to say that if it were made quite specific and clear in the wording of the amendment that this was not to be deemed to be in any way in conflict with the directors other duties the government would look <e>", "<cs> who could do other than welcome the co-operative way in which the minister is behaving in respect of this very modest amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him and will certainly avail myself of the opportunity to discuss with him any possible difficulties <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again one is bound to be grateful to the minister for having considered the matter so carefully and being if i may say so sympathetic to the approach taken in this amendment <e> <s> i should like to deal with the difficult part first and i expected that the government would find it difficult <e> <s> it is the principle which has become a matter of religious belief so far as the government are concerned which is that you must not allow the director to go beyond a certain point <e> <s> i know that this has been continually referred to in debates in another place <e> <s> the view is that you somehow contaminate his proper duties if you allow him to go into what would be in the governments view the improper duties of having some controlling interest in the supply of gas <e> <s> i repeat that i am not an expert in this matter <e> <s> i doubt if there is anyone in this committee who is more ignorant of what a gas field looks like than i am <e> <s> nevertheless we have to deal with these principles as best we can and i have found it very difficult in reading carefully everything that has been said in another place on this issue to understand why the government seem to be so totally wedded to this concept <e> <s> i can well understand that those who are engaged in producing and selling gas should say to the government we do not like interference <e> <s> they would would they not <e> <s> i would be surprised if they gave any other answer <e> <s> of course they would not like to have the director concerned in their commercial freedom <e> <s> but i do not regard that as a conclusive argument <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will think a little more about that side of it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may trouble the minister for a little more information <e> <s> i follow the reasons which the noble lord has given for seeking to remove these two subsections and i follow the ministers explanation of what is involved in them <e> <s> the minister said this means that the third party would be on equal terms with a public gas supplier in supplying gas as to the cost of carriage <e> <s> what i want to ask him if he can answer is this <e> <s> by the time you have included all these costs charges proportion of depreciation and all the rest of it are you making it commercially impossible for the would-be competitor to compete <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord harris of high cross decides what he is going to do about his amendment perhaps i may say that i am most grateful for that explanation <e> <s> of course i am anxious that there should be fairness of treatment and if possible parity of treatment but there are times when you have to have regard possibly to marginal costing as opposed to full costing in making a commercial activity possible and getting it off the ground <e> <s> what the noble lord has said is that he sees no real difficulty in an alternative supplier being able to supply on these terms <e> <s> we shall be very interested therefore to hear what the noble lord lord harris has to say in relation to the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the consideration that the minister has given to this matter <e> <s> will he help me further by saying where the general development order is to be found in the bill <e>", "<cs> then it is all part of the bill or does not need to be part of the bill because it is in a statute that has continuing relevance <e>", "<cs> my understanding then is that it is an order and so it may be treated as all orders may be treated and it may be revoked <e>", "<cs> without any further reference to this bill <e> <s> as i feared therefore one is in a less strong position than one would be if the provision were incorporated into the bill itself <e> <s> we are back in a situation that the noble lord was good enough to recollect <e> <s> we are all right as matters stand but circumstances change <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he has made it clear that parliament has to be involved <e> <s> if we are sure about that i agree it is a measure of protection <e> <s> i hope the minister will nevertheless agree that this exchange of views has been worthwhile <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his undertaking and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this point when we are considering clause stand part the committee has an opportunity of asking questions concerning several issues arising in the clause where the meaning may not be clear and where so far as we on these benches are concerned we should like greater clarification in order to be quite sure as to whether we need to take further steps on report <e>", "<cs> if i may say so on behalf of my noble friend it is a very great help to those of us on this side of the committee who carry great responsibility that my noble friend was willing to step into the breach and move the amendment <e> <s> he may not have had time to see that it is proposed in the grouping of amendments that this amendment no <e> <s> b should be taken with amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> if he did not say so in introducing the amendment it was merely a slip of the tongue <e> <s> i am sure that anybody who is as generous-hearted as the noble lord who has just spoken and i have good reason for saying that and i recollect it well will not wish to pursue such a slip of the tongue <e>", "<cs> yes i am grateful to the minister indeed it does <e> <s> i had feared that the marginal and the full cost would be so different as to inhibit that activity completely <e> <s> the noble lord assures us that they will be quite similar <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted with the answer that the minister has given because he could not have picked on two difficulties easier to explain away <e> <s> they are the easiest ones in all the subsections in the bill <e> <s> his first difficulty is that the franchise would be for a period of five years i think he said why he said that i do not know because the only reference to five years is in subsection which says <e>", "<cs> we are under very severe time constraint <e> <s> obviously it is not possible to expect a minister to take on board a new idea immediately <e> <s> the government will need time to consider this <e> <s> the further diffculties he mentioned i could deal with just as readily as i dealt with the earlier two <e> <s> there are no problems whatever about finance where you have a franchise no problem at all about providing the necessary finance when you have a franchise <e> <s> the difficulty of knowing what to do with contracted gas at the end of the day is really of such minimal proportions that i am sorry the minister thought lit to raise it <e> <s> it is just like saying what do you do when you transfer a business and you have a few outstanding debts <e> <s> or what do you do when you transfer the ownership of a house and there are rates unpaid <e> <s> of course you make provision for that <e>", "<cs> that is a very interesting answer and one which i had not appreciated <e> <s> in those circumstances i shall consider very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> in the meantime i thank him for the explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i am very happy that that should be so <e> <s> i have not spoken to them but i do not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> what he seems to be saying in general terms is that there is no need for these amendments because broadly the situation is satisfactory as it is <e> <s> that may be so and i shall read carefully what the noble minister has said <e> <s> did the noble lord in his reply say that there was no need for the director to be sent a report days prior to the making of it in the official sense because in the ordinary course of events he would have an opportunity of seeing the report before it is published <e> <s> that is of some importance and i should be grateful if he would make that position clear now <e>", "<cs> it is because the director is familiar with the subject matter that i thought it would be of advantage to the monopolies commission to let the director see the draft report before they sent it out officially and committed a howler something which can be committed by people who have no intention of doing so at all because they have not referred to the authority on the matter <e>", "<cs> the next amendment amendment no <e> <s> i za is of some importance <e> <s> if the committee and in particular the leader of the house think that there is any advantage in moving it i shall do so but there is no possibility of covering it in the time available <e> <s> it will make not the slightest difference i can assure the noble viscount the leader of the house to the point of time at which the committee stage is completed so far as we on these benches are concerned <e> <s> therefore i am not certain whether the committee wishes me to proceed with clause <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what he regards as the governments responsibility in relation to the policy of british telecom in printing telephone directories <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene on a matter of explanation <e> <s> can the noble earl confirm that he referred to an injection of new money additional money and that it is not merely a reallocation of the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> i do not need to go over all the ground again but it will be obvious to the committee that part of our duty in perusing a bill at committee stage is to raise questions as to whether the clause should stand part of the bill so as to obtain a clearer understanding of the bill and to see whether it requires amendment in any particular respect <e> <s> of course it is our responsibility to do that during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord who is in charge of the amendment decides what advice he will offer to the committee may i suggest to the noble lord the minister i am not asking for any further commitment that in giving further consideration to the views behind the amendment he might consider whether it would be appropriate when appointing members of the consumers council that one such member should have special knowledge of and interest in small businesses <e>", "<cs> i hope when the noble lord the minister comes to reply he will be able to make clear something which i find totally unclear and i am not a lawyer <e> <s> where a landlord who deserves to be prosecuted is prosecuted and if necessary is sent to prison which is a very great deterrent i should have thought is it impossible for the tenant to take separate proceedings for damages in a civil court <e>", "<cs> i raise this point shortly <e> <s> clause provides for bodies corporate and others being guilty of offences <e> <s> i want to be assured that the clause is not too draconian as it might seem to be on casual reading <e> <s> subsection of clause talks about a body corporate being guilty of an offence

straightforward <e>", "<cs> i should have said only i am anxious to save time that of course one is familiar with this in a nationalised industry we are talking about privatising this industry and

barrel <e> <s> i gather from my very knowledgeable friend lord ezra that it is at the moment about eleven dollars a barrel <e>", "<cs> i anticipated that at the outcome of this discussion we would be more discontented than we were at the beginning and that is the case <e> <s> if i may say so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i accept what he says that discussions are still going on

basis <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who moved this amendment i suspect must feel as unhappy as i do not <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord lord belstead tried to make the technical point that the acceptance of the amendment would cause difficulties about issuing debentures at a later stage <e> <s> that is not the issue everyone knows it is not the issue <e> <s> if the amendment is not acceptable in that respect let the noble lord say so and move on to the other respect <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to pursue this but i must <e> <s> it is very good of the noble lord who has just spoken to

indication of what the price is going to be <e> <s> we have suggested a way of arriving at the minimum <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent selling at more than this <e> <s> these words mean the

"<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a wholly inadequate answer <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord has once more shown that he is not prepared to <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been good enough to meet the substance of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stoddart and the substance of the amendment moved by myself <e> <s> all that remains for me to do is to thank the government <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister who on this occasion has given the matter careful thought and explained the reasons why the government do not think that this is a happy amendment <e> <s> he said that there was room for two points of view <e> <s> i take a slightly different point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord speaks on these matters with immense authority as i recognise <e> <s> he has given examples which are straightforward and the secretary of state would have no difficulty in deciding on his action <e>

example he may be bed-ridden and cannot carry out his job but as i mentioned on a previous occasion he may have recovered in a fortnights time or may consider that he will have recovered in that time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he is able to tell us as a matter of fact if the present draft contract which is no doubt being prepared for the prospective holder of the office includes a separate clause dealing with the problem of physical incapacity <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say at this time of day is that i very much hope that the minister will be good enough to bear in mind the reason why i thought fit to put forward this amendment for discussion and probing <e> <s> i am very grateful for the helpful attitude of the noble lord lord marshall of leeds <e> <s> one expects anybody coming from leeds to be very helpful and i am very grateful to him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly have not considered all the provisions of the employment protection consolidation act <e> <s> naturally i assumed that the government with the resources and advice at their disposal would be in a better position to do that than a single member of your lordships house such as myself <e> <s> i have listened to what the minister has had to say <e> <s> i recognise that it is not wise to legislate for a particular difficulty in this way <e> <s> we ought to address the act itself but the act is not to come before us and this is therefore the only method we have of dealing with the problem <e> <s> i think that what the minister has said has force and therefore with your lordships permission i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having taken on board the daring suggestion that the drafting was not perfect <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister and congratulate the draftsman on a very neat piece of redrafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but it would help if the noble lord could tell us the up-to-date staffing position of oftel <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the discussion we have had clearly underlines the necessity for a clause of this kind <e> <s> we are told now and as usual have been very modest and have under-estimated the figure that the figure is not as it used to be at the end of but is now nearer <e> <s> the minister says that the proposed staff of ofgas which i repeat at first glance would seem to have much more onerous duties than those of oftel is to be something less than one third of the present staff of oftel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just as puzzled as the noble lord but i am as usual very cautious about attempting to interpret figures when i do not know what they refer to <e> <s> all i know is that they refer to more things than the staff of ofgas <e> <s> so far as i recollect they refer to the consumers council as well so it may well be that it is contemplated that the consumers council will build up its responsibilities in the various areas of the country over a period and that the out-of-pocket expenses will be very high <e> <s> certainly if there is going to be only one consumers council in london and everybody has to pay fares to get from distant parts of the country to london every time there is a meeting there will be a huge bill in respect of travelling expenses alone which will run into millions <e> <s> i do not know how this is made up and i cannot guess <e> <s> am trained to look at the facts and not to pull them out of the air <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> presumably he was not here on the two occasions when the government did not sustain a house and when if the matter had been carried to its proper lengths business

lords i have already been consulted about this <e> <s> there are very good reasons why they should be grouped in the way that i invited them to be grouped and in the way that so far as i know they are

a different point and then my list does not cover the rest <e> <s> but there are three more groupings covering the whole of those amendments <e> <s> that being the case and i shall have no difficulty

stated that we are moving into uncharted waters <e> <s> so far as i am aware it has never previously been the case that gas has been a single entity in private hands <e> <s> it has either been under

possible opposition and every suggestion <e> <s> that is the side that i am on <e>", "<cs> i shall give way in a moment my lords <e> <s> the noble lord has asked for the view of the alliance on the problem of the privatisation of gas and other privatisations <e> <s> our view is that a government with the enormous power that this one have in both houses should exercise it with restraint and have regard to the future <e> <s> they should not force the country into the situation which we have and of which we are all sick and tired of nationalising and privatising nationalising and privatising

incapable of answering sensibly any of the amendments we have put forward <e> <s> he is incapable of listening to what has been said <e> <s> i never said one word about that <e> <s> i was not vague i

number of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the cries of order <e> <s> are about <e> <s> i have not spoken so far on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervened once to ask for clarification while the minister was on his feet <e> <s> i do not know if that counts as a speech if it does not then not having spoken i seek the leave of the house to speak now <e>", "<cs> my lords before he sits down i should like to ask the noble lord to clarify one point <e> <s> will he be a little more clear about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is the proposal to transfer the statement of powers from the schedule to the clause <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that the powers will not be increased as a result of putting them in the clause and that these powers vitally important and very wide as he says are adequately placed in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank the minister for having in large measure met most of these points and to delay the substantive discussion until we get to the amendment to which he has referred in the name of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords may i seek leave of the house to withdraw my amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not give any clear indication of the matters he keeps talking about <e> <s> will he tell the house exactly what has happened <e> <s> why are we in this totally different situation <e> <s> all the proposals made when the bill was being considered were rejected by the noble lord because there was no time to protect the future of the industry or the interests of parliament due to the need to rush through the legislation <e> <s>

management of housing <e> <s> first do the government accept that description <e> <s> secondly the noble lord made an extraordinary point suggesting that a number of local authorities were playing politics instead of repairing houses <e> <s> i am sure that he did not intend that to be a general smear <e> <s> therefore will he be good enough to write to me with a list of the authorities to which that description applies and also put a list in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support very fully the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> in reply to the speech to which we have just listened according to my marshalled list we are talking about page line which deals with the abolition of the corporations special privilege and starts off as from such day <e> <s> the amendment refers to making an order which is the order fixing the day <e> <s> what we are therefore considering is not the general principles of which the noble lord has reminded us but the day on which the present monopoly of gas supply shall cease to exist <e> <s> it is that day not the general principles which have been decided at second reading whether or not we like them with which we are seeking to deal in order to prevent the government being pressed into forgetting the national interest as a result of the cash flow to which they are increasingly becoming subjected and anxious

the issue <e> <s> i am sure that both the noble lords will accept that that statement could only have been made by an individual who has not been a member of the other house and suffered the guillotine procedure <e> <s> of course it is impossible when you have a large committee such as a standing committee to control the timing to the extent to which we are able to do so here with our

intervened and i am sorry i did not see his first attempts at intervention <e> <s> no that is not our position <e> <s> our position is that you should search for competition if you are introducing a privatised monopoly <e> <s> you should go out of your way to search for it <e> <s> i agree that there are not many evident areas where you can compete <e> <s> i agree with the whole problem that you cannot put down two sets of pipes next to each other <e> <s> that is why we on these benches maintain and indeed the whole of the opposition maintains that this is a natural monopoly <e> <s> therefore

whatever perfectly good representations they ought on second third or fourth thoughts to alter the authorisation <e> <s> it would still be before the relevant date <e> <s> it would still be within the power of the government to alter it <e> <s> it would not be within the power of the government to notify the house or to obtain the reaction of the house to it <e> <s> what does the minister propose to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any point at this stage in pursuing the argument <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble

is quite right and therefore i seek to leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the minister has to say and i am grateful to him for explaining that the government have taken the point on board and have paid serious regard to it but have not been able to come up with an answer <e> <s> i think that they will have to find an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he help us by giving an indication as to where in the bill are to be found provisions which would enable the director to insist on alterations in the authorisation so as to require an improvement in the services which he thinks are inadequate <e> <s> the amendment deals with standards of service <e> <s> the noble lord has stated that the director has powers to alter the conditions of the authorisation <e> <s> i agree that he has certain powers but where does he have the powers to insist on alterations in the conditions of the authorisaton of a kind which related to his view

clause <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i could not hear everything that the noble baroness said <e> <s> i gather that she is asking whether i intend to press the amendment

of the document i asked the minister to be good enough to confirm that it is precisely covered in the document <e> <s> that is not open to me and therefore all i can do is endeavour to get a copy at a later stage to see whether it is in there <e> <s> if it is there is no need to take the matter any further <e> <s> if it is not in we shall have to bring it up with the necessary implications at a later stage <e> <s> that being the case i seek your lordships leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have reached an extraordinary situation in your lordships house quite clearly where the government are not prepared to deal in any real sense with the amendments put forward from this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course if i accused the noble lord unfairly i would be the first to apologise <e> <s> all that i can say is that i caused inquiries to be made at the printed paper office and the answer was that it was not available <e> <s> if it is available why do the government demonstrate it on the government front <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that when my noble friend lord ezra went to the office and asked for a copy it was not available <e> <s> i should not make accusations like that if it was in fact available <e> <s> all i can say is that it is obviously now available if the noble lord lord brabazon has been able to get a copy <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for his courtesy in passing it along <e> <s> a little courtesy of that kind saves a great deal of bad temper and waste of time <e> <s> i am grateful to the government for having supplied that document <e> <s> i do not suppose that in the circumstances the minister asks me to apologise <e> <s> i have explained why i made the statement which i made and i am sure he does not deny that it is the responsibility of the government to provide the papers <e> <s> he now says that the papers are available and i am glad that they are <e>", "<cs> if the minister will tell me what i have to apologise for i shall be the first to apologise <e> <s> i can only repeat in case the noble lord lord denham did not hear what i was saying that my noble friend lord ezra was unable to obtain a copy <e> <s> it may be that copies have since been obtained but as a result of that lack of facility at the time <e> <s> i was relating what i thought was the fact at the time which was confirmed as the fact at that time <e> <s> i am grateful to have the copy now <e> <s> we could have avoided this storm in a teacup if the government had been good enough to pass the document round a little earlier

leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was going to say something about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusion is fairly obvious <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his consideration and for having given a full and courteous reply to this amendment <e> <s> i hope that he does not get into any trouble on that account <e> <s> we are grateful to him but of course it is not the case that the amendment requires no cross-subsidisation in relation to free safety checks <e> <s> it specifically excludes in line of subsection of the proposed new clause work relating to <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard what the noble lord had to say with regard to the strength of the directors position <e> <s> i must say that i cannot see that his position is weakened in any sense by offering consultation with the council <e> <s> i am sure that the two are complementary to one another and not opposed to one another <e> <s> i should have hoped therefore that the government would have accepted what is a very minimal amendment namely to bring in the council in its proper function of being consulted nothing more than that when the price is fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i shall consider it carefully and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i never disagree with the considered view of the parliamentary draftsman and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down on that single point of the per cent <e> <s> i am sure he will confirm that that is on the part of the costs other than the cost of gas <e> <s> the cost of gas is about half and therefore this represents about per cent <e> <s> on the total <e>", "<cs> my lords it is somewhat late and therefore i cannot pursue this matter to the same extent as i would otherwise want <e> <s> this is an absolutely crucial matter <e> <s> it is crucial for the protection of the consumer and i cannot see that the premises which the noble lord has been good enough to agree with lead to any conclusion other than the one i have drawn <e> <s> it is the non-gas costs to which the per cent <e> <s> refers <e> <s> the non-gas costs exclude the cost of gas by definition <e> <s> i am sure i can turn it up in an answer by a minister but it is firmly implanted in my mind that the cost of gas is approximately one-half <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard what the minister said and i am grateful to him for giving attention to this matter <e> <s> but of course i do not know the precise circumstances in america to which he is referring or whether the americans have continued the system of protection they have and to which we have referred in earlier clauses and which so far as i knew had continued <e> <s> so there may have been a temporary upset which has been cured for all i know and the main essence of the system continued <e> <s> i do not know without going into the matter with much more care whether it is a fair example to bring to show that this provision would not work <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what the noble lord lord stoddart has just said <e> <s> not only would the abolition of standing charges be good in terms of public relations but it would be a minimum justice to those at the poorest level who use the minimum amount of gas and who therefore pay more for their heating per therm than do the rest of us <e> <s> those who are in particular difficulties and perhaps even elderly persons who may suffer if they do not have enough gas are discouraged because of the price <e> <s> they use as little gas as they can because they cannot afford to consume as much as they need and the net result is that they pay a price per therm that is excessively high <e> <s> that would be avoided by the adoption of this amendment which commends itself to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i was only anxious to get the governments reaction to an idea which i said must have been thought of many times and i am glad to have confirmation that it has been and that there are good mechanical reasons why it has not been adopted hitherto <e> <s> although i understand that this is in the long-term future it may be that we shall not have the pleasure of officers inspecting our gas meters at all in time to come <e> <s> having heard the answer and having been told which was my main anxiety that there is no bar on an arrangement of this kind being made in future if it is desirable to do so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we ought to be absolutely clear in our minds as to what all this algebra <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely wrong and i should be grateful if he would withdraw <e> <s> we have explained many times that we are governed by the second reading <e> <s> we have stated what our views are and all the amendments coming from these benches are directed towards introducing competition and improving efficiency in the new privatised gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> is the minister therefore saying that clause which provides for modification by agreement does not apply to the price formula which is part of the authorisation <e> <s> the first part of clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always grateful to the noble baroness who speaks with great knowledge authority and experience which the rest of us do not enjoy about what is happening at present in the nationalised gas industry <e> <s> it is very encouraging to hear what she has to say and to learn how concerned are the government with the interests of the consumer <e> <s> that is excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords i took it that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne was intervening to correct a fact <e> <s> as far as i am aware every noble lord is allowed to challenge any other noble lord on a question of fact without asking the leave of the house and so i acquit the noble lord of any discourtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister because as i understand it the house will find it convenient to discuss with amendment no <e> <s> my amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c <e> <s> except for amendment no <e> <s> c these provide an alternative to the wording suggested by the noble lord and cover very much the same ground <e> <s> the amendments suggest that an order should be sought from the court to cut off a supply <e> <s> the question of expenses is covered in the same way as in the bill <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b is consequential <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to this amendment because it was the wish of the minister who is in charge of the bill at the moment that it should be discussed with the other amendment <e> <s> we all know that that is in the discretion of the mover and of nobody else <e> <s> may i ask him whether as a result of that co-operation i am to be denied the right which i otherwise would undoubtedly have had of replying as the mover of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that ruling <e>", "<cs> my lords one would have to take advice to see whether it is correct <e> <s> it is an encouragement to members of your lordships house not to agree to grouping as you deny yourself the right of reply but there is an opportunity for any noble lord to say by leave of the house i should like to respond to the ministers reply as i should have been entitled to had i not agreed to the grouping that he suggested i agreed to the grouping and on my own initiative suggested that we should agree to it and so let me say with the leave of the house that i am sorry that the ministers comments on the amendments were based on a misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords these are unhelpful replies <e> <s> we have been into this area before and the minister merely repeats the arguments used on a previous occasion when we are making quite different points and are relying on his objections on a previous occasion to secure the good will of the government by meeting those objections and putting forward amendments accordingly on a different basis <e> <s> it was said previously that it was clear what the law was and that there was no need to state it <e> <s> we said it was not clear and that we should state it and therefore we put it in the bill merely as a declaratory proposition <e> <s> it cannot hurt anybody to have it in the bill in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what the noble lord lord sanderson has just said <e> <s> of course there will without any compulsion from a clause like this be a development by the gas corporation of points of contact with the customer where it can sell its products and ideas <e> <s> that is why this amendment puts no limit whatsover in its definition of area on the gas corporation <e> <s> what it does do is to enable to happen the very thing the minister says should happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have a point to answer in fact they have two points to answer <e> <s> the first major point is that we have been asking time and again for the authorisation at all events when it is finalised to go in the bill or in a schedule so that it can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his consideration <e> <s> i did not completely follow his argument on the earlier part because i thought that the use of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i think that covers the matter completely <e> <s> therefore i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving this matter his attention <e> <s> i am bound to admit that i am somewhat confused <e> <s> first let us deal with the slightly irrelevant part of the noble lords answer which dealt with the power of the secretary of state to be involved in references to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> that comes under a separate clause and not under the clause that we are considering which deals with modification by agreement <e> <s> therefore the reserve power to which the noble lord referred does not touch on the main point of my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister but if he will forgive me for saying so he has repeated what we already know <e> <s> the government do not propose to embarrass the british gas corporation in any way by providing competition although he may not have put it in those words <e> <s> in support of that philosophy he produced arguments which are not arguments against the proposal <e> <s> there is no difficulty in overcoming them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and i am glad i put down the amendment again in this form to bring out this point <e> <s> i was anxious that on the noble lords previous description of the matter there might be circumstances under which neither court would be functioning and the issue would fall between two stools <e> <s> the minister has helped me in an area which is not the easiest one to follow by giving an assurance that that simple proposition does not stand and there would not be a slipping between two stools <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no great matter of principle involved here there is the matter of giving the director more time than the minister now proposes <e> <s> i recognise that we are all pushing in the same direction <e> <s> i thought the additional time given to the director would be of convenience to him and of benefit generally <e> <s> if the government are satisfied that the existing arrangements will work so be it <e> <s> they have been good enough to consider it and i am grateful to them for that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he has said <e> <s> if he will forgive me for saying so some of it needs time to consider and to investigate <e> <s> it is very helpful that he has said what he has said in directing us to the relevant parts of the acts which are referred to here <e> <s> i entirely accept the philosophy behind it as he has explained it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord i shall certainly read most carefully what he has had to say and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only apologise for not having spoken to it earlier and will not move this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the situation i am bound to accept it from the minister who is more fully advised than i am because i can rely only on my own advice which is not very adequate <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> it makes very clear what was not clear to me before <e> <s> the simple answer is that all of these clauses apply to all of the conditions <e> <s> that being so i do not think there is any purpose to be served by having an annex or by continuing this discussion any further <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to repeat where the power is to be found in the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for referring me to schedule which is headed revocation of authorisation <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only faintly hopeful that the noble lord would be moved <e> <s> i thought it right to make one final attempt and to include all the remaining references in that one attempt <e> <s> the noble lord has been good enough to repeat the governments view <e> <s> there is nothing more we can do about it except to ask the leave of your lordships house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not appreciated what the noble lord said but he speaks with advice and authority <e> <s> if he says that all the topics which i have mentioned are already covered in the clause there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord does not accept the amendment and i am even more sorry to hear the argument he has adduced in favour of that refusal <e> <s> with regard to unfair competition versus electricity for example this is an argument that has been put forward by members on his own side when they have been available and have been here to move their amendments or not too tired <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he has said <e> <s> it confirms me in my view that it was wise to put down this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for making it clear that as i feared there is no power for the director to have access <e> <s> one may say that certain courts do not have access but of course they have powers to require individuals to bring any documents and any matters relating to the dispute before the court <e> <s> everybody has to comply with that no matter how private they are and of course there are vast penalties for not doing so <e> <s> i do not think that is a relevant consideration <e> <s> however what is a relevant consideration is that i cannot imagine any auditor being able to carry out his functions of auditing and giving a company a certificate without having access to the offices warehouses stockrooms and every other place where documents are kept in case he needs to refer to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said and i agree entirely with his reference to vat which is a very relevant point indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is quite right <e> <s> i allowed my noble friend to intervene and i therefore seek the leave of the house to say how grateful i am for what he has said <e> <s> i now have difficulty in deciding how far to press this matter <e> <s> i do not think your lordships would wish it to go to a division at this hour of the night and i certainly do not want to cause any more inconvenience than has apparently already been caused <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether he was replying to amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> i believe that he was referring to a different amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> f is not the same as an earlier amendment and i believe that the minister must have been referring in his reply to a different amendment <e> <s> will the noble lord be good enough to say to which amendment he was replying <e>", "<cs> my lords that makes it difficult to understand the ministers logic because amendment no <e> <s> f is a very different amendment which takes power to provide for a reduction in the allowable gas cost <e> <s> the earlier amendment had nothing whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as he said it is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss in a general way the functions of the council <e> <s> he has courteously and briefly described its scope and the reasons why in his view the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> there is great force in what he told us <e> <s> i repeat my gratitude and seek the leave of your lordships to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for what he has said and in particu-lar i am grateful to him for using words which are very different from the words which he used on the previous occasion when he said at col of the <e>", "<cs> the governments reply is not unexpected <e> <s> i should make it absolutely clear that the reason we wish to bring in parliament is that we want some public airing of the decisions that the government are making and if i may say so some protection where protection is needed of the public purse <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> we are anxious that the mistakes that have been made in the past should not be repeated and that the drive which is at present afoot to dispose of assets of this kind should not take place for political purposes but only for good economic reasons <e> <s> that is why we are anxious that there should be at all events a public airing which parliament would provide <e>", "<cs> i am sure that he was reading the reports in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the ministers view that this is not suitable for the bill but it is our view that it is very suitable for the bill <e> <s> an announcement has been made but the details of the announcement are not very clear and the voting rights are not very clear <e> <s> there is no need for us to fall out about it because we are driving at the same objective by only slightly different routes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has given us much information and the last piece of information was very welcome <e> <s> he has indicated the extent to which he prefers the provision he has in mind to the one we have on the marshalled list <e> <s> that of course provides for a special shareholder to be given statutory backing <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting something different but he has been very forthcoming and described the situation very fully and i shall read very carefully what he has had to say in the hope that it will not be necessary to come back to this point at a later stage <e> <s> having said that and repeated my gratitude i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very interesting to hear the government giving the reasons for making share provisions in the bill itself or at all events stock provisions for british gas stock <e> <s> i entirely agree that they should be in the bill and we hope that this will be regarded as a useful precedent for putting other similar matters in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised to hear that reply <e> <s> i was hoping however that the government would indicate that they are taking the matter a little more seriously <e> <s> it is perfectly true as the noble lord started by saying that all this indicates some lack of trust in the wisdom and discretion of the present government <e> <s> i am trying to be as objective as possible in examining the record to see what success has been achieved by the government in arriving at suitable and fair prices for flotations to which they have previously been party <e> <s> they cannot claim much success <e> <s> the last flotation that of british telecom was by general consent a pretty disgraceful error of judgment <e> <s> we hope to avoid that by providing the machinery in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the minister has to say and i think that that is an over-simplistic view of arriving at a valuation <e> <s> i would have regard to the basis of valuation to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> i would also very much have regard to the value of the net assets <e> <s> anyone who ignores that completely must expect to find himself in a little difficulty if a company comes on difficult times and has to sell its assets or whatever the case may be <e> <s> it is a very familiar formula so far as accountants are concerned to take this measure into account <e> <s> i would not go so far as to say that this is the whole answer <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no point in prolonging the argument <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for replying <e> <s> the reply was on the lines one expected i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only going to ask the noble lord whether he has any knowledge of when the house can expect to receive the report and accounts which i understand are due fairly shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not object to that <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord just to consider a little more carefully what he has said <e> <s> is he quite sure that there is nothing in any of these many amendments which we have not yet had the opportunity to consider which affects the bill in any material way <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my fault <e> <s> there are a number of amendments here and many of us have not considered them at all carefully because we were expecting that the noble lord would speak to each one and explain their content <e> <s> we do not want to put him to that trouble at this hour and so i would ask the noble lord whether he could merely confirm that they do not affect the contents of the bill in any material way <e>", "<cs> my lords to return to money aggregates would the noble lord the minister help us as to what is the policy of the government with regard to these aggregates <e> <s> do they recommend them as being helpful <e> <s> do they take the view that they are to be regarded as helpful on some occasions when the thermometer registers the temperature that they think it ought to register and not on other occasions when it does not <e> <s> the house is in total confusion as to what is the governments view of targets <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every single word the minister has said and i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in his place and so i assume that he has no desire to speak on these matters <e> <s> it therefore falls to me to say how grateful i am to the minister for the very careful consideration that the government have given to this aspect <e> <s> the issue is purely between as the minister himself has said mandatory and permissive or voluntary <e> <s> we wanted to make sure that it was not voluntary but compulsory that is to say that it would be compulsory or mandatory as we would prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister seeking to intervene <e> <s> no then with your lordships permission i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the full consideration he has given to these amendments and i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for what he had to say <e> <s> it would have been more satisfactory to me and clearly also to the noble lord lord stoddart if the minister had come to the conclusion that it was possible to include these amendments prefaced if necessary by the words without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing <e> <s> that always deals with the situation in which anyone including the government and this very bill wants to bring in a particular matter without bringing in all matters and therefore makes it clear that the generality is not affected by the particular instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that we are talking about very different things <e> <s> i hope that i may exercise my right of reply to say why i think the government are not meeting the purpose of the amendment and to add a point which i did not want to bring in earlier because it is wholly different and relates to information on energy efficiency which has only just reached me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for some slight and distant encouragement namely that the government will of course consult the bank of england as they always do <e> <s> what the noble lord is telling us is not quite the same as is put forward in this proposal <e> <s> it is only a proposal for consultation and therefore differs totally from previous amendments <e> <s> however the minister has gone as far as he can go and all i can do is repeat my gratitude and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am as anxious as all your lordships are to make as much progress as we can before we rise <e> <s> no doubt those in charge of business will take account of that <e> <s> it is my pleasure first to echo the appreciation which has been expressed on all sides of the house to ministers who have carried out their duties with unusual charm and patience <e> <s> a tremendous load is carried by ministers in your lordships house

bill their main responsibilities the matters about which they have the most natural knowledge and on which they do not have to brush up with help from the box behind them and by carefully reading briefs are not the ones in which they have been participating in the gas bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can answer a related question <e> <s> the noble lord did not say a great deal in reply to the noble lord lord williams as to whether the government thought that it was worthwhile to encourage wider share ownership and this particular scheme in this way at the <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to express our gratitude to the minister for repeating this statement which merely amounts to another sorry episode in the sad tale of the governments determination to privatise a section of our defence industry no matter what <e>", "<cs> my lords may i repeat two of the questions which i asked the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that when he has a number of questions fired at him it is not easy to answer them all <e> <s> however there are two questions which i believe to be important <e>", "<cs> before the matter is left at this stage can the minister say what kind of consultations were made with the professional bodies before these clauses were framed <e> <s> i am particularly concerned with regard to the very difficult issue of an auditor being put in the invidious position of having to disclose information against a client who pays him for doing it <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware most auditors charge on a time basis <e> <s> the only product they have to sell is skilled use of time <e> <s> let us suppose that an auditor is required to spend seven hours for example reporting to the secretary of state on matters about which the secretary of state has inquired <e> <s> under the statutory compulsion that it is proposed should be laid down in this bill the auditor will incur a considerable charge <e> <s> under the bill the secretary of state and the <e>", "<cs> it will be obvious to the noble lord that i have not had the opportunity of consulting my own professional body as to their reaction to this <e> <s> the presumption is since they have not written to me objecting strongly that they do not object strongly <e> <s> nevertheless i have grave anxieties about this and i am bound to draw the ministers attention to one or two things which he said <e> <s> for example he said that he did not think there would be many occasions when an auditor would be put under compulsion and that that would only occur when things had gone wrong <e> <s> however that cannot be the case <e> <s> of course the secretary of state will want to know whether things have gone wrong simply because they will appear to have gone wrong <e> <s> the whole purpose of requiring further information from the auditor will be either to confirm the secretary of state in his suspicions or to contradict those suspicions <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i too belong to the institute of chartered accountants but i have not practised since and i have had no financial interest in the profession since then <e> <s> i was waiting to hear what the minister had to say to find out whether there was a single solid argument against the amendment <e> <s> i must say that i have not heard one <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be good enough to reconsider the answer which he gave as regards the amount of profit which the post office is allowed to keep <e> <s> the fact that he said that the external financing limit was a negative one means does it not <e> <s> that the post office does not and i repeat not retain all its funds but that part of them are passed on via the consolidated fund for the other purposes which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> is it not important that the country should understand that of the charges made part of them are for the benefit of those who use the post office service and part of them a small part but nevertheless a part are for the benefit of other services <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister aware that we on this side i am sure in common with all the members of your lordships house are very grateful indeed for what has just been said about the precedent which the leader of the house is going to adopt in these unusual circumstances where there is a party conference going on at the same time as your lordships house this workhouse is uniquely engaged <e> <s> may i also ask the minister in view of the fact that the resources available are one of the essential ingredients of the whole of his announcement and also in view of the fact that what he has so far indicated is that there will be a pure transfer and no new resources allocated for the purpose whether when we reach the relevant amendment to which he has referred the noble viscount will have instructed himself completely so as to be able to tell the house exactly whether there are new resources and where they are coming from <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the government have obviously given such little thought to a proposal which is not a party proposal there is nothing partisan about this at all and which has the support of all the local authority associations <e> <s> it is very odd is it not <e> <s> that they should be opposing unitedly something that the government think is good for them and that they think is very bad for them <e> <s> they are the people who make and grant the planning permissions <e> <s> they are the authorities who seek to have developers come along and develop in their area <e> <s> they are the authorities who want to see their derelict land turned to good use <e> <s> they are the people who are elected by the local electorate in order to achieve that end for them <e> <s> they know their local circumstances precisely <e> <s> it is they who think that the governments proposals are irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has made my point for me namely that the secretary of state can require a local authority against its will and the will of its electors to create a simplified planning zone <e> <s> that is all i was saying <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness who is so well informed about this matter <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will forgive my attempting as a complete amateur in these matters to clarify the meaning of an amendment on behalf of my noble friend who is the authority on these matters <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about this amendment is of course that it had to be put down in advance of the very clauses which it seeks either to eliminate or to add to as an alternative approach <e> <s> i feel and i hope that the committee will share this view that we shall be better informed of the governments plans after we have discussed clauses and and that we shall know more precisely whether they can do everything which a proposal along the lines of our amendment can do but i believe and am advised that that is not the case <e> <s> however we shall listen very carefully to what the government say on clauses and <e>", "<cs> i want to make it quite clear that we are supporting this amendment for all the good reasons which the noble baroness has given <e> <s> in particular i want to add a way forward if it appeals to the government <e> <s> the amendment as it stands merely removes ten and inserts five but as the noble baroness said the main reason for doing this is that nobody not even the government if i may presume to say so can read the future precisely over the next five years <e> <s> we know to begin with that there are anxieties about the possible blight effects at the margins and so on <e> <s> there may be very good reasons why the government should like to limit this in the first place to five years as the noble baroness has suggested <e> <s> but at the same time they could take powers in the ordinary way by resolution of both houses of parliament to renew such a period of five years for a further five years if it seemed right to the government of the day to do so and no doubt if it seemed right to parliament as would almost certainly be the case <e> <s> i hope that in reply the minister will bear in mind the possibility of this extension which could easily be arranged between now and report stage with the cooperation of all sides of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> we are in some difficulty since i understood the minister to say on an earlier amendment that he is willing to see representatives of the local authorities professional representatives and any noble lord who wants to accompany them in order to consider whether or not quite apart from the provisions of this clause there ought to be the kind of proposal which was made in amendment no <e> <s> a which i had the privilege of moving <e> <s> i would suspect that any vote against the clause stand part motion is capable of being interpreted by the minister as a hostile act in anticipation of those discussions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has added to his many qualities that of complete ambivalence and it makes it not all that easy for those who wish to see business pursued with expedition to know what to do <e> <s> nevertheless i am still hopeful that between now and report stage he will study what has been said and that report stage will provide a further opportunity for deciding whether the simplified planning zone schemes are as the minister says likely to adduce certainty which is the essence of what all developers want or are in the view of all the local authorities likely to do the very reverse <e> <s> none of us wants to prevent an experiment from being tried even though it would be an over-long and over-complicated experiment <e> <s> therefore the stance of noble lords on these benches who supported that first amendment would be that we would not wish to oppose the passing of the clause at this stage and would hope to find something better at report stage <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether in view of the fact that we are altering the town and country planning act so as to be almost unrecognisable as we have already altered the housing act the government have any early intention of introducing a consolidation measure so that those who are interested in these matters may be able to ascertain what is the law of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to welcome the points that have already been made and to repeat the gratitude which we on these benches feel towards the government and the minister for the sincere attempts that the minister has made to reduce the chaos caused by putting down so many amendments so late and totally overwhelming the capacity of opposition parties adequately to deal with these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer my noble friends question did he <e> <s> the question was whether the appointments would be free of any political commitment to which the noble lord said that those appointed would be of the highest calibre <e> <s> can i have his assurance that men and men embraces women other than of the conservative party are possibly in the category that might be described in suitable circumstances as being of the highest calibre <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has come before us so extremely well briefed no doubt he can give us the figures of the cost to the exchange of preventing the rise in interest rates until very shortly after the tory conference was over <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept from me that referring to one of his own comments nobody in this house would accuse him of any impropriety and therefore no one in this house would seek his resignation on any cause whatsoever <e> <s> is it nevertheless not the case that there is a discernible trend for more and more legislation <e> <s> there is always pressure there has been pressure for very many years <e> <s> is it not the case also that so that people may understand these things the noble viscount is doing the nation and parliament a great service by continually stressing that the pressure for more and more legislation comes more from outside parliament and outside government than from within it <e> <s> is it nonetheless not the responsibility of a government to resist such pressure when the result would be more than parliament can sensibly digest <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons that i wish to support what my noble friend lord ezra has said out of his deep knowledge of these matters on the bill and the reasons that i think the government are right are three in number and are very brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he said that he was on his final point but he has said nothing about a matter on which i believe the government should express a view <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble lord would give his view on the suggestion that members of the panel who are connected in the main with large institutions have not as a result of that any interest in the small shareholder <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the noble lord the minister informed us very recently that the questionnaire to be submitted to the long-term unemployed is a questionnaire to take away and fill in <e> <s> in those circumstances can he kindly tell us how many questions are on this questionnaire to be answered by those people who unfortunately cannot read any of the questions <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have no questions to ask <e> <s> i rise merely to say very shortly that having heard all the arguments and having read what preceded this we are in full support of what has been put forward by the labour front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of all the exchanges which have recently taken place in this chamber is the home secretary reconsidering whether there should be an extension of capital punishment to catch people who are found guilty under this heading <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement and for helping the house in a sphere with which perhaps he is not wholly familiar <e> <s> i must say if i may borrow from the well-known advertisement that it appears that becoming a junior minister in the house of lords is very much a gymnasium of the mind <e> <s> the noble lord has to turn his attention to a great variety of matters <e>", "<cs> my lords having given notice to both front benches and having listened to a series of speeches from the conservative and the cross-benches all criticising the government i hope i will be forgiven for saying a few words in favour of the governments point of view <e> <s> i had some experience of and responsibility for these matters in my time which was of course a long time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it was because i did not want to detain your lordships further <e> <s> the answer is such an obvious one one goes to arbitration <e> <s> as every practising accountant knows it is very difficult to value private shareholding <e> <s> i am sure my professional colleagues will confirm that immediately <e> <s> it is terribly difficult <e> <s> one has to have something on which to anchor it on which to hang it <e> <s> there can be argument after argument and a minority shareholding in a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest possible respect that is just not accurate <e> <s> it is not accurate to say that no allowance was made for the intervening period <e> <s> as my information goes the full interest was payable from the date that the compensation was payable until the date that it was actually paid <e> <s> the full interest took account of inflation <e> <s> it is the only way one can take account of it <e> <s> that is the normal way of taking account of it <e> <s> so i am afraid that i am not affected at all by that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also look forward to the maiden speech which is to follow mine and i hope that the noble lord will not have to wait more than another half hour before he has an opportunity to address us <e> <s> i also hope i am not too late to congratulate my friend and ally lord bonham-carter on a maiden speech which was both stimulating and balanced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as an amendment to the motion at the end of the address to insert but whilst recognising the contribution made by services to the economy regret the lack of adequate provisions to revive the manufacturing base of british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will be good enough to allow me to say a few words at this appropriate break point for reasons which i shall explain in a moment <e> <s> however perhaps i may first say how grateful i am and from what has been said i am sure is the whole house to the noble lord lord poltimore for his very informed speech <e> <s> on such an issue if i may be so bold as to say this to him it is of more than usual importance that someone so well versed in the practice of what we are discussing should come to the chamber and so to speak give evidence on what really goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be a little unfortunate for the noble lord but does he recollect the speech i recently made praising the work of and again accruing from the financial services and services generally <e> <s> he will recognise that i have every sympathy with that aspect of our economy <e> <s> is he further aware that i share the views of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter about the excellent service provided by the central statistical office to departments and indeed to royal commissions when they have need for continual contact as did one of which i had the privilege to be chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches are most grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we should like to add our appreciation of the fact that the government have thought it proper to consult both houses of parliament at an early stage <e> <s> i am sure that this will help forward the best possible outcome to these difficult and longstanding negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely right but i want to press the minister further on the very unsatisfactory answer he gave me with regard to paccar <e> <s> i specifically asked a question which he can answer <e> <s> it does not relate to how far the negotiations have reached <e> <s> it does not relate to any of the details which he regards as <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to associate ourselves with those remarks <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house both for the initiative he took during the course of the debate on the queens speech and for the speed with which he has started to implement it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> will he explain what there is to prevent people putting their names down to speak on this motion if they wish <e> <s> how is one to know in advance what the total speakers list will be <e>", "<cs> my lords before these regulations are passed without a word will the minister be good enough to explain to people such as myself who do not fully understand what is happening what kind of voting is proposed for northern ireland in the motion that he is putting before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the death of the head of the family whenever it happens inevitably causes great sadness to the members of that family <e> <s> it is to them that we on these benches first of all offer our deep sympathy <e> <s> that sadness is shared by the many friends of the late lord stockton <e> <s> indeed the whole house sorrows at the passing of a great man <e> <s> in the course of one memorable speech he was able to earn the admiration of us all and to regenerate to the full his reputation as a great statesman <e> <s> we are glad that after some hesitation he came to the view that as an ex-prime minister he should accept membership of this house <e> <s> we all know what a substantial contribution he was able to make in spite of severe personal difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully supporting every word that my noble friend lord wigoder has said may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he takes the view that it would be unwise to base an alteration in the law on one incident and terribly unwise to base it on that incident when one does not even know where the incident is <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from the question of parliamentary draftsmen for whom after years and years of experience with finance and other bills i have nothing but praise does the minister think that there is something to be said for this house accepting the responsibility for maintaining the purity of english <e> <s> have the government in mind any ideas for setting up a committee to consider the possibility of how we should best achieve that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for what he has said but regrettably we cannot welcome the statement <e> <s> we want to make it clear to the government that the only statement on this issue that we would welcome is the kind of statement that btr has recently made with regard to withdrawing from its proposed purchase or proposed takeover bid <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may repeat one very important point in addition to what the noble earl has mentioned <e> <s> he has referred to only per cent <e> <s> whereas the arrangement that is proposed permits of a far higher percentage than that <e> <s> it is with regard to the vesting date <e> <s> the minister has been good enough to say that he does not at the moment contemplate the need for postponement but others fear that the date may have to be postponed <e> <s> frankly can the minister say what serious damage to defence procurement would arise if it were postponed for a short period <e> <s> i cannot see that there would be any at all <e> <s> a postponement could be immensely beneficial to the atmosphere of consultations which take place in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords my first duty is to make it clear that although there was a time when i had a financial interest in this matter that is to say up to when i was a very modest name at that date i became chief secretary to the treasury and since then have had no interest whatsoever <e> <s> we on these benches also wish to thank the minister for repeating this very important statement and to join in thanking all those particularly the chairman who have devoted so much time to preparing a thorough and speedy report which is very valuable in present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister have regard when they are available to all the conclusions which the government may reach as a result of the inquiries and other activities at present taking place <e> <s> will they have regard to the overriding interest of this nation that the city should be regarded if justified as fully sustaining the responsibilities which it carries <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers statement that this matter has been going on far too long can he tell the house whether the letter that his right honourable friend sent with a view to bringing it to an end was sent prior to or after my noble friend lord hunt put down his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to his last statement with which i am sure the whole of your lordships house will agree namely that we should not make a political football of these statistics can the minister say what earthly relevance there is in producing a proportion of people who are seeking work by reference to people who are not seeking work to wit the self-employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the appetite of your lordships house for statistics is very nearly satisfied <e> <s> for that reason i propose to spend a short time only on that aspect and more time on what i regard as perhaps the more substantial aspects in the motion <e> <s> i do this partly because i agree with virtually every single word that the noble lord lord mccarthy said in criticism of the statistical approach of the government and of the secretary of state <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord for this opportunity to make a fairly detailed statement justifying that anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government publish those figures <e> <s> those of us who are interested and who go to the trouble of getting the monthly digest of statistics the labour force survey other documents that are made available from time to time and the single article produced in <e>", "<cs> such approval from the other side is very encouraging <e> <s> i have before me an interesting booklet our policy in black and white <e> <s> it sets out every single detail of what we propose if we succeed in winning the peoples support as we have succeeded in winning it in all the by-elections at the next general election <e> <s> we have obtained more votes from the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord take a little more seriously what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> he raised an issue which excites sympathy on benches other than his own <e> <s> would he therefore see to it because we cannot see to it that if the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter wishes to introduce a clause of that kind the money resolution and the title of the bill will permit it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the principle which i believe lawyers generally accept that if something untruthful is said and you do not object at the time you may be held to be accepting that untruthfulness <e> <s> in those circumstances can the leader of the house advise me how i am to deal with the extraordinary statement made by one of his supporters that no member of the alliance has ministerial experience <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of these benches i offer our thanks to the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> may i say immediately that we welcome those parts of the statement which broadly we can call good news and we do not need therefore to ask further questions on those matters <e> <s> we must concentrate on the proposed merger which has very unhappy possibilities attached to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for some of the answers that he has given me which go some way but not the whole way towards answering the questions that i have asked <e> <s> we are anxious to know whether this is a merger or a takeover <e> <s> let me be precise <e> <s> the noble lord said that we will have two <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that informative answer <e> <s> may i ask for a little clarification on what he said about nuclear arrangements <e> <s> am i correct in believing that no american is allowed to see the propulsion unit of any nuclear submarine being built at barrow <e> <s> if that is correct can he say whether the government are quite content about the new arrangements there under which an american company with libyan connections is available to maintain those propulsion units <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that there is considerable anxiety in the house both about the libyan connection and about the nuclear situation <e> <s> does he recollect that one of his own back-benchers on the last occasion this matter came before the house asked him whether he could remember any possible case where the americans were doing the same with us in reverse <e> <s> the answer was that there was no possible suggestion of the americans being as foolish in a contract which we might have in one of their dockyards as they are with us <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that he simply has not answered fully the question as to why there is this totally inconsistent treatment <e> <s> why do we deny americans the right to see the propulsion unit and give a firm which i repeat has libyan connections and in spite of what the minister says has a majority control of the work the right to inspect what other americans are denied in barrow <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he would have given the house a fairer descrip-tion of the growth of this country to which this question referred if he had started his figures from the point of time at which his government took power and had responsibility for them <e> <s> is it not the case that whereas the long-established trend in this country over this century is a growth rate of per cent <e> <s> per annum the average growth rate achieved by this government is one half of that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord correct the statement that he previously made <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to any of the figures can the minister give us some idea of the estimated cost of computerisation and the estimated saving in labour that will follow from it <e>", "<cs> my lords even in the short time available i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for raising a matter of such importance as to attract a large list of speakers including two most distinguished maiden speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer which does not take the matter very much further <e> <s> what i am really interested to know is this <e> <s> when but for the intervention of the bank of england at the request of the government interest rates would have fallen why the government then continues to insist on imposing on every businessman and on every house buyer this wholly excessive burden <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express my deep appreciation to the government for having brought down interest rates just before the question came to be answered having regard to the fact that my question was put down some weeks ago <e> <s> will the noble lord say whether it is correct and i have not seen this on the tape that the other half per cent <e> <s> will come immediately after the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister possibly tell us the opinion of the other member countries of the ec on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords does the scope of the inquiries of the noble lords right honourable friend also cover the question of whether this expenditure is allowable as a deduction for income tax purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will insist on choosing this opportunity to make a wholly unnecessary highly regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this bill reached peoples very sensitive feelings and their religious feelings and it was thought proper therefore throughout the alliance for individual conscience to have the final say <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness say whether the comparison which she was good enough to give the house is in real terms or in cash terms <e> <s> if it is the latter can she tell us what the comparison is in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that ministers of this government have now taken the unusual step of not being responsible for what they say <e> <s> is it not serious that the current account which was shown to have a billion surplus only the year before last should now been seen to have a million deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a serious matter <e> <s> is it not equally serious that the gap in the trade balance should have increased in the same year from billion to billion <e> <s> irrespective of any minor variation in the figures what do the government propose to do about that <e> <s> do they propose to ask the cso to have another look at its figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say on what authority he said that the noble lord was right <e> <s> is the minister aware that the first thing that happened on the first day on which i took up my responsibility as chief secretary was that i was presented with a piece of paper by the senior adviser to the treasury showing that there was that deficit which has been widely publicised since <e> <s> is it not monstrous that at this stage anyone especially a supporter of a government who are in all these difficulties should challenge that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard some extraordinary comments from people who have no knowledge of the circumstances but who are <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister that i was at a meeting and therefore unable to be present at the very start of these discussions <e> <s> this matter arose last week and the government are now taking the stance that if the cso publishes figures that is the end of the matter <e> <s> the cso has the responsibility and it exercises that responsibility in an absolutely proper manner to the best of its ability <e> <s> we understand that <e> <s> but the government have the responsibility of accepting these figures and giving government authority to them <e> <s> it is no use the minister saying this is the case and the government are doing very well relying on cso figures and then alternatively saying no we are awfully sorry the government are not doing so well but this is nothing to do with the government it is the cso which puts up the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to take on board that nobody is criticising the government for reducing their estimates and taking a prudent view on figures of which they have no detailed knowledge <e> <s> the criticism arises only on increases in estimates for which there is no justification <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that my name was not put down as a speaker <e> <s> i shall therefore be very brief <e> <s> the arguments have been put extremely well already <e> <s> however i want to add the whole weight of these benches against this mad proposal <e> <s> i am not merely asking questions as has been done so ably by the two previous speakers i suggest that the government should think again <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one further question however <e> <s> the minister has stated that there is authority for her comment that the gap between rich and poor in terms of health has been widening since the mid-s <e> <s> will she be good enough to put in the library before wednesday a statement of the authorities on which she relies <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord will share everybody elses view that one of the main elements in being competitive is that of unit labour costs in manufacturing which he has quoted <e> <s> can he tell me how the figures which he has given which i find so surprising that they are well worth careful investigation correspond to or reconcile with the figures given by his noble friend who is sitting next to him which show that comparing with unit labour costs in manufacturing in japan went up by per cent <e> <s> in germany by per cent <e> <s> and in the uk by per cent <e> <s> three times as much or more <e>", "<cs> my lords we too wish to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating this very important and very long statement <e> <s> it deserves the kind of very careful consideration that it is impossible to give to it in the time that we have had available <e> <s> it almost goes without saying that it is of such importance that we would naturally expect an opportunity to debate it fully <e> <s> i do not ask for an answer on that point at the moment but i merely state what my noble friends and i think is the obvious having regard to the importance of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords inasmuch as all that the minister is saying is that the government are behind joining in principle but are not clear as to the timing would it not be sensible for them to make up their minds and end this nonsense which compels the minister continually to give rather silly replies to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as is well known to your lordships house we on these benches at all times are anxious to facilitate government business <e> <s> it is for that reason that although we have followed with the greatest care every amendment that has been moved and spoken to for and against this afternoon we have not thought it appropriate to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not need saying from these benches that we are wholly in favour of the spread of private share ownership <e> <s> the liberal part of the alliance said so many times long before the tories took it up <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that million very good figure though it may be is somewhat less than million which is the number of shareholders in all the companies which have been privatised by the present government <e> <s> is the minister also aware that it is not our task to criticise the spread of share ownership but to criticise first the way in which shares of privatised companies have been disposed of and secondly the lack of investment of the proceeds of the sale of capital <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> i hope he will not mind however if i say that i find it a little disappointing <e> <s> members of your lordships house in receipt almost daily certainly weekly of applications to subscribe to a variety of very doubtful schemes may be in a position to judge the merits of such schemes <e>

less cautious members of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was good enough to ask me whether i am aware of any dubious schemes <e> <s> in the hope that he will consider prosecutions in appropriate cases may i ask him whether he is aware that i have in my hands a letter sent to me at my home address appealing in a most barefaced manner for a subscription to a fund <e> <s> all it says is <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important statement and we are most grateful to the leader of the house for repeating in full the answer to the private notice question by no less a person than the leader of her majestys opposition and in connection with a statement made by an ex-prime minister relating to issues affecting another ex-prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the circumstances which led to the leader of the house repeating the answer to a private notice question in the other place have shown that matters have developed and that public opinion is very disturbed indeed about the condition of the security service <e> <s> is it not the case that all of us want to see the security service well-maintained and kept in a high state of morale which is far from being the case at the moment <e> <s> will the minister therefore reconsider whether his somewhat dismissive answer is appropriate in todays circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be good enough to use her offices to encourage the policy of integrating women more fully into their inheritance rights in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> when the government set a precedent by giving assistance to harrogate were they careful to make quite clear the fact that that was not creating a precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the minister for making this statement at this particularly opportune time <e> <s> it is a further example of how general elections concentrate a governments mind on the employment needs in particular constituencies and we welcome it accordingly <e> <s> i too want to be assured as to the position with regard to the manufacturers requirements <e> <s> they have said that million is their minimum figure and million is the figure which has been i hope agreed upon <e> <s> we on these benches have no objection whatever to government expenditure being kept at figures which are acceptable to the government if the same purpose can be achieved and we wish to congratulate the government rather than criticise them on this reduction in the figure provided that it is satisfactory on second thoughts to the manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to press the minister again on one point <e> <s> of course we are all in favour of the project and we hope that it will be very successful both in terms of the profits for those participating in it and because it illustrates what we on these benches believe is a very good principle and one which should be carried out as often as possible in joint enterprise in european activity <e> <s> this is a time when the minister could make his reservations felt <e> <s> i hope that he has more reservations than he has expressed in replying to my question about accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always an enormous pleasure for me to follow my noble friend lord ezra who speaks with such authority on the matters that he is discussing <e> <s> i found his speech today wholly acceptable <e> <s> he was talking about the efforts that we all put in to try to provide some measure of competition in the gas industry when it was being privatised in order to maintain the governments philosophy that one should not turn a public monopoly into a private monopoly <e> <s> in the time that we all all spent on that i was not lacking in either industry or patience myself <e>", "<cs> my lords with the results of the general election so fresh in all our minds would it not be reasonable to expect that the requests for independent inquiries into the bbc or other methods of attacking it from that side of the house might not recur so frequently in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put another point of view on this difficult issue to the minister <e> <s> is he aware that i have had a great deal of experience of having a pistol put to my head at about pm on a friday for further government funds to meet that weeks wages and that that is a normal ploy <e> <s> would the minister have preferred to have taken more time if he had not judged the matter to be of such urgency <e> <s> further did he reach his conclusion on his expectation of what future circumstances would be in six or months <e> <s> if that is so would it not be reasonable for the minister if not attaching conditions to have some form of monitoring as to what happens after he has given his consent because otherwise as the house clearly fears all the paraphernalia about the protection given by the office of fair trading and the monopolies and <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start by thanking the secretary of state the noble lord lord young of graffham for introducing this debate with such care and so fully <e> <s> i understand very well that he is no longer able to be present in the chamber <e> <s> he has been good enough to send me a note of explanation <e> <s> i am sure it is to the benefit of us all that there should be a member of your lordships house who is such an important cabinet minister <e> <s> it is of nett benefit to us and we have to take the disadvantages with the advantages <e> <s> we understand that from time to time he has to withdraw from the chamber when he would otherwise wish to be present <e>", "<cs> my lords did i say exclusively <e> <s> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i meant to say that one chamber depends mainly on heredity and almost exclusively on male heredity <e> <s> the number of females entitled to be members of your lordships house by virtue of heredity is minimal <e> <s> a chamber which is based on that principle and another chamber which is based on disproportional representation can hardly be called the constituent parts of a democratic parliament <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i do <e> <s> i anticipated the noble earl whom the noble lord no doubt has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand that answer and i expect that other noble lords have the same difficulty <e> <s> is it not the case that every bill has on it a notification of the resources involved and that parliament is fully aware of that at the time the bill is passed <e> <s> is the minister telling us that the government allowed a bill to go through in the full knowledge that they did not have the resources to carry out the will of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the responsibilities of the minister which he has already acknowledged can he assure us that everything practicable is already being done in advance of study of the report to secure the safety of passengers on this method of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl insists on surrendering the responsibilities of government why does he continue to sit on that side <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some noble lords strongly disagree with the proposition that what is proper for a representative of the government to say in another place is improper for a representative of the government to say in this place <e>", "<cs> my lords i too participated in yesterdays proceedings and i should like on behalf of all on the alliance benches to say how grateful we are to the leader of the house for having dealt with this matter in his usual masterly and responsible way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now talking about tax reform and has left the general economy <e> <s> will he say nothing about the trade figures which were issued yesterday and which point in a totally different direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek your lordships permission to speak in the gap which is in the speakers list <e> <s> i have given notice and apologise that i did not put my name down on the list as i did not realise that there would be one <e> <s> i shall accordingly be very brief <e>", "<cs> my lords more than one chief secretary has spoken in this debate and if the noble viscount accuses me of that i would be bound to remind him that one of the things i did as chief secretary was to provide resources for the then conservative opposition in the house of commons which i thought was absolutely essential in the interests of democracy even though my advisers did not share my view completely at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the long recess almost always results in our returning with some new and very sad memories and that is the case today <e> <s> in particular we mourn the loss of one who was our leader <e> <s> but our first thoughts must go not to our own sense of bereavement but to the loss sustained by his family <e> <s> it is to them on behalf of all my friends that we offer our most sincere condolences <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord as he was required by courtesy so to do warned his former colleagues that he was once more going to repeat the criticism that they interfered unwisely in the affairs of the royal ordnance factories <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he did not fully follow my question <e> <s> he has just told us once more that the advantage of this is that the government are no longer free to interfere in the affairs of the royal ordnance factories <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also thank the minister for repeating the answer to this private notice question asked in another place <e> <s> i understand the view he has taken that in the circumstances he is not in a position to answer questions but it does place a slight difficulty on those of us whose duty it is to ask questions <e> <s> however i will cope as best i can <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i too should like to thank the secretary of state for repeating this full and fortunately very bullish statement <e> <s> i do not share entirely the views which have been expressed <e> <s> our approach is somewhat different <e> <s> the statement shows continuing growth and good prospects <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an excellent report <e> <s> i rise to give it the fullest support and to extend my compliments to those who contributed to it <e> <s> one had only to read the list of names of those taking part to see that it would be an excellent report <e> <s> i am glad to see that the group has resisted the temptation which all committees of this kind fall into when asked to look into procedures of suggesting a great variety of changes <e> <s> it has considered everything most carefully <e> <s> the report gives a great deal of background information and reaches the conclusion that there should be no change in our fundamental procedures <e> <s> we welcome that completely a feeling shared i hope by every one of your lordships <e> <s> it follows that if we accept that view as i am sure we do there arises no question of selection of amendments which would be wholly inconsistent with such an attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble earl for the opportunity to discuss this matter <e> <s> there is nothing formal in my remarks i really am sincerely grateful because this debate gives me the opportunity to pay a tribute which i have long wanted to pay to a body of very skilful dedicated extremely hard-working and thoroughly loyal men <e> <s> i refer to parliamentary counsel who undertake the drafting of bills <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to associate ourselves with this valuable consolidation <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a great pleasure for me to listen to the excellent maiden speech from an old colleague not least because he brings to this <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to express our gratitude to the secretary of state for making this very important statement and making it with such clarity and brevity <e>", "<cs> it is a very important statement on a very important industry <e> <s> we are bound to treat the matter with the greatest possible responsibility <e> <s> there is no need for me to delay your lordships by repeating that our attitude in general to privatisation is that we are prepared to consider each matter on its merits but that those who wish to change from the public to the private sector or the reverse have the responsibility of making a case <e> <s> the case has to be made on the grounds of greater competition and efficiency <e> <s> at first glance it would appear to be much easier to make that case for steel than for the water or electricity industries or in particular for gas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the practice he has adopted of giving a reason for privatisation is most welcome and will he bear that in mind on future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might have your lordships indulgence to speak for a moment at the break-point in the order of speakers <e> <s> i feel strongly that this is not the appropriate body to decide an issue on which arguments have been put forward from both sides on behalf of reputable bodies and who feel that this right lies with each of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate many of the reasons that have led whoever made this proposal to come to this conclusion <e> <s> i am in no way hostile to it <e> <s> as this is not an example to which the leader of the house has just referred of the decision being at the disposal of two ordinary members of the house but one in the control of government may i ask what steps he took before reaching the conclusion to put down the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a preposterous answer when we have been told time and time again over very many years that two part-time workers count as two jobs <e> <s> no attempt has been made to determine what a full-time worker is <e>", "<cs> my lords we too wish very strongly to be associated on this happy occasion with the remarks which have been made <e> <s> many noble lords must have shared the experience which i have frequently had on being a member of a parliamentary delegation visiting the chamber of the parliament in question and seeing there some important piece of furniture which has come from the mother country and which has given great pleasure to all who have seen it especially when they are fellow countrymen <e> <s> i think this is a most happy idea on what is undoubtedly a very great occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord has made it fairly clear that he considers this matter incomplete and that the statement came to us as a matter of courtesy rather than as a matter of right i hope that your lordships and in particular the leader of the house will appreciate that we shall not be able to deal with a further statement made on behalf of the secretary of state in another place unless that statement is repeated here without question <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the minister made it very clear that what he is talking about are the rights of all citizens <e> <s> having regard to the rights of all citizens how does he reconcile what he says with how the citizen in question will feel if directed to go to a particular charity and appeal in a dickensian manner for assistance <e>", "<cs> my lord as this is the last question in question time can the noble earl inform me or can the leader of the house inform me what would be a convenient opportunity to express the pleasure which i feel and which i dare say is shared by all your lordships at the return of the noble viscount lord whitelaw to your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell me whether the details relating to the type of flue of one of these power stations is a matter for government policy or is it a matter within the management discretion of the cegb <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree entirely with what has been said from the opposition front bench to the extent that we welcome the statement repeated by the noble earl <e> <s> i should also like to say that we welcome the arrangements made through the usual channels which permit this discussion to be taken at a very convenient moment <e> <s> i hope that this will be a useful precedent for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this is an appropriate time for me to seek your lordships indulgence to ask the leader of the house whether he has it in mind to seek the guidance of the procedure committee on any necessary clarification of our normal procedures with regard to personal statements and whether he is of the view that such clarification might be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords what complaints has the minister received from professional bodies against a system which has been carried on hitherto quite satisfactorily as far as my professional memory carries <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to offer our thanks to the leader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the suggestion in the noble and learned lords last answer that with regard to all the other cases he is not aware of any breach of criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords we too wish to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for having repeated this very important statement <e> <s> our reactions very largely tie in with what has just been said by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for rising again but i should like to clarify one point <e> <s> i drew attention to the enormous importance attached by us to <e>", "<cs> my lords would it make the slightest difference on this issue whatever question we ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> before she finishes is she going to say something about the statement made by the minister that this bill has the support of trade unionists and public alike <e> <s> i believe those were his precise words <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the lord privy seal for having explained not only what is in the bill but also what is intended by it although not expressed therein <e> <s> i also thank him for having explained the purpose of it so clearly and in a manner which is likely to keep the temperature as low as possible <e> <s> i must say that i too do not like the bill <e> <s> but i come to that conclusion not in advance of considering the bill but on having considered its intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister strays too far from the point that he was making about the mandate i should like to point out that it has been stated that at the last election the conservative manifesto did not include a reference to water but having regard to the fact that the progress of water privatisation had come to an abrupt halt the impression given was that it was no longer part of the governments policy <e> <s> is the noble lord in a position to throw any light upon that assertion <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of the monitoring to which reference has been made is it possible to publish the statistics in the various categories for which they are available showing the proportion of cases which have been dealt with by fixed penalties <e>", "<cs> my lords has consideration also been given to the practice in certain continental cities where if the pavements are empty and the roads are full parking is allowed on one side of the road on the pavements thereby enabling traffic to flow more readily <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the secretary of state for making this statement <e> <s> we note with pleasure that he will report the outcome of the discussions at the earliest opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords taking what i am afraid is precisely the opposite view to that of the noble lord who asked this question on the impact of short-term versus long-term capital gains tax perhaps i may ask whether the noble lord is aware that there is still considerable anxiety with regard to insider trading <e> <s> is he also aware that there is a considerable body of opinion which takes the view that the first major step to be taken with regard to insider trading is to freeze the capital dealings of directors of companies during the period that they hold their directorships of those shares in that company <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord believe that the best method of coping with the congestion of business which was bound to arise at this time was to get rid of the chairman of the sib <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a wholly unsatisfactory state of affairs when the minister is not prepared to come clean if i may use the phrase about the governments intentions with regard to the disposal of a national asset <e> <s> does the minister not recognise that the government are in the position of trustees and have the duty to try to secure the highest possible price in the interests of the beneficiaries who are the whole of the british nation <e> <s> does he recollect that i raised this matter at the very moment that the original statement was made <e> <s> the matter is still not cleared up <e> <s> finally is he aware that in interview after interview the chairman of british aerospace has made it perfectly clear that he realises the strength of his negotiating position and has said in advance that he is prepared to give very little for the purchase of this company <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the figures that the noble lord gave in his first reply can he tell the house what account has been taken in them of the relative price effect <e>", "<cs> this is a very unfortunate situation <e> <s> both sides of the committee are entirely agreed that certain proposals on which the government have set their heart should proceed <e> <s> indeed both sides entirely agree that these proposals should proceed with due speed <e> <s> we ask the government how long do you think it is all going to take <e> <s> perhaps they wish to add on a year or two years but there must be time-limit <e>", "<cs> i too should like to fully support this amendment <e> <s> i am very interested in the comments that have come from the other side of the chamber <e> <s> naturally we pay more attention to those and i expect that the government do too <e> <s> so far as i am aware the only time in which the word proposing is used without an object is when the proposer is on his knees with a bunch of flowers and he is making a proposal <e> <s> i do not know whether that is a further alternative that might be included in the definition of those words <e> <s> we are all making the same point that the whole of this clause is drafted so widely as to include anything under the sun <e> <s> we really ought to have some control of it and the control proposed in this amendment is the natural and obvious one of parliamentary control <e>", "<cs> we are most grateful to the noble earl for what he said by way of explanation but unfortunately there is a lot more explaining to be done <e> <s> i should like to clear the following point straight away because it may help in the argument <e> <s> he asked where we stood on the nra <e> <s> the answer is that we think it is a very good idea subject to seeing the details of it <e> <s> the national rivers authority is not a piece of privatisation it is a reconstruction of a public body as part of a scheme of privatisation <e> <s> that scheme of privatisation has been made clear by the government and appears as the noble lord lord renton has just reminded us in the explanatory memorandum as the second of two main objects of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton who is very well informed on these matters of legislation and procedure <e> <s> it may be that that is an alternative which will suggest itself to the government <e> <s> we do not mind in the slightest whether it is done in the form of this amendment which has stood the test so far in the discussion which has gone on <e> <s> it has indicated that what we all need is a scheme of privatisation which shows exactly what is proposed <e> <s> we do not mind whether it is done in this form or in an intentions clause which is another way round it <e>", "<cs> i never expected the government to bring forward as a reason for this bill and for the wording of this bill the fact that they are not ready to put their privatisation proposals to the nation <e> <s> that has happened once already and the proposals were all withdrawn <e> <s> we all know that that happened with regard to water <e>", "<cs> to put it politely i find it very difficult indeed to accept what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> the noble earl has said a number of things <e> <s> he has said that it is impossible for the government to start discussions with the utility companies on the details of the proposals <e> <s> i find that very difficult to understand <e> <s> i cannot see why the government should not go and start discussions with the utility companies here and now <e> <s> they have the full powers to do that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may expand on what the noble lord lord williams of elvel has referred to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one further point before the minister replies lest he should be tempted to give us the same reply as last time that all this can be dealt with in the main legislation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to return to this <e> <s> we are beginning to realise that the government put a totally different interpretation on the word proposal from our understanding <e> <s> in fact i would go so far as to say that the noble earl has misdirected himself in relation to the meaning of the word proposal <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the indulgence of the committee while i wipe the dust from my eyes so that i can see the position more clearly <e> <s> i have rarely had more dust thrown in my eyes than by the speech made by the noble earl <e> <s> of course i realise the position <e> <s> it is that ever since this government came to power they have underprovided by way of capital expenditure for the maintenance of the nations assets in their variety of forms <e> <s> that can be seen by anyone using his eyes and common sense when walking through any city and seeing the ways in which it and its infrastructure are run down wherever he looks <e>", "<cs> we have got absolutely nowhere <e> <s> the minister has not understood the arguments at all <e> <s> we are not arguing for or against privatisation <e> <s> on these benches we are prepared to consider every privatisation issue on its merits <e> <s> we are not impressed by the argument from the particular to the general which is what the noble earl contented himself with on his last intervention when he said look at this and look at that <e> <s> he gave two examples and said that perhaps i was not aware of the amount spent by the water industry on leaking pipes or something to that effect <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will permit me to intervene <e> <s> the noble lord knows that i always listen with the greatest care to what he says and with the greatest respect especially in this area where his knowledge is deep and wide <e> <s> i agree that the nra will be a very helpful body <e> <s> however the trouble is that nowhere in this bill is there a single mention of the nra <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for what he has said about the environment <e> <s> there is only one difference between us now <e> <s> the question is whether the appropriate time and place for dealing with it is on this occasion and in respect of this bill or during the passage of the later bill <e> <s> that distinction is not of such great importance provided we have the same government <e> <s> we shall take that as one of the unfortunate probabilities namely that the same government will be in power in the next few months while it introduces the new bill <e> <s> that being so it is of considerable satisfaction to hear from his own mouth <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one or two words in support of what my noble friend with his deep knowledge of the coal industry has already said <e> <s> we are concerned with the transfer of assets from the public sector to the private sector <e> <s> in the public sector it is proper to take account of a variety of costs <e> <s> for example it is proper to set down the cost of a public corporation buying coal at a greater price than need otherwise have been the case <e> <s> it is proper to take into account in that same assessment what would have to be paid in unemployment relief to <e>", "<cs> the beginning of subsection states <e>", "<cs> the noble lord himself may be satisfied because his intelligence is immensely greater than mine <e> <s> however i could not follow and i have listened to every word <e> <s> it is a simple point <e> <s> what will happen if privatisation does not go through <e> <s> under the powers of this bill the utility companies will have done certain things at the request of the secretary of state and will have incurred costs <e> <s> let us assume that the government change their mind <e> <s> perhaps they will say with regard to water sorry we are not ready <e> <s> we have considered the matter further and as a result of all the information that has come in we have decided to give the matter another six months consideration <e> <s> we are not going ahead with it in this session <e> <s> in the meantime all this expenditure has been incurred <e> <s> my reading of the bill is that as one would expect it is the consumer who will pay <e> <s> we want to know from the government whether that is right <e> <s> does it fall on the consumer of the relevant utility <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a word in explanation of the amendment which appears in the name of the noble lord lord ezra and myself <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for having explained his amendment and particularly for having underlined the point which must exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i start on common ground which is always a good place from which to start <e> <s> every one on all sides of both houses has given nothing but praise to the management and employees of this industry for the remarkable turnround in its results and for having demonstrated that it is now a reliable viable company making good steel good exports and good profits <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that british steel plc will control more than per cent <e> <s> of the production of steel <e> <s> is that not under the law as it stands a monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a case especially for this government also to take special account in their considerations of the day of atonement <e>", "<cs> we cannot let this matter go in the vague fashion in which it is being discussed at the moment <e> <s> i charge the minister with making statements from the front bench for which he has no authority <e> <s> it is all very well for him to say what the local authority will do <e> <s> neither the local authority not the courts will have the benefit of reading and following the ministers speech <e> <s> they will have to be guided by the act in its final form <e> <s> the most recent example is the minister telling us that when the magistrate considers making the order which he is invited to make by the local authority he shall assess <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to seek clarification of the position with regard to united states servicemen many of whom live off base with their families and now pay rates but in future will not pay the community charge <e> <s> for example in the case of the united states air base at alconbury i am told that some personnel plus their wives and families live off base and huntingdon district council estimates that it could lose up to which would mean an increase of between and for all other huntingdon district charge payers <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> perhaps i may explain that my noble friend lady stedman would have been here <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are putting forward the extraordinary argument that the richer we are unexpectedly so the less we are capable of giving a share of our gnp to countries that need it <e> <s> is that the latest example of conservative morality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely unhappy about the official use by the government of the words creative accounting <e> <s> that seems to cast quite unnecessary reflections on a perfectly normal process and secondly on what seems to be an inevitable warning to us that they are about to introduce retrospective legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for informing the house so quickly <e> <s> we are glad that the matter has been finally resolved in the belief that this will mean securing for this country a motor car manufacturing industry without which no countrys economy is strong <e>", "<cs> when the minister comes to reply to the debate perhaps he will clear up a point on which i am confused <e> <s> as i understand it under the proposed new tenancies it will not be illegal for a landlord to propose a premium on residential property by whatever name it may be called <e> <s> assuming that i am right in supposing that it is the governments intention that landlords and tenants should get together and agree the terms of a tenancy it may be that in some cases it will suit both parties for a small premium to be paid rather than a larger rent and in other cases perhaps a slightly larger rent will be charged with no premium <e> <s> what will the effect of all that he on the relief and housing benefit which the minister has promised will fully take the place of increased rents rising through market forces <e> <s> will the premium whether it be small or large be taken into account and spread over the period of the tenancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask for a few more minutes <e> <s> i think that i must rise to explain why i shall be voting for the government and recommending my colleagues to do likewise <e> <s> i completely share the views expressed by the noble viscount lord whitelaw <e> <s> i recognise the benefits that he was able to introduce for this house during his period of leadership <e> <s> i must be a great simpleton but i find less difficulty in this matter than some of your lordships <e> <s> noble lords are entitled to discuss broadly what they like and to come to whatever conclusions they like <e> <s> they are not prevented and i very much hope that they never will be from exercising their discretion as to what topics they discuss and what they do not discuss in their own way and by their own general consent <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends on these benches i should like to express the same sentiments which are sincerely held <e> <s> i go as far as wishing some of the members on the government front bench a longer rest than perhaps they might find convenient <e>", "<cs> however i should give warning to the government that it is a matter on which they have failed year after year <e> <s> when the appropriate time comes we must ensure that the situation is not repeated because of the inconvenience caused not only to your lordships but more particularly to those who must and do help us and who have no spokesman in this house to see that their cares are noted <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord has removed all these difficulties will he be good enough to make a statement in this house so that we may know his solution <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not feel that these exchanges indicate real hardship among borrowers particularly those borrowing for the first time to provide themselves with a new home <e> <s> will he consider whether there are any means by which the government can encourage the issue of fixed interest mortgages <e>", "<cs> my lords while all of us on these benches are most grateful to the secretary of state for having made the statement i think that i must preface my comments by saying that the main conclusion to be drawn from this sad affair is that it underlines what we already fully know <e> <s> anyone who invests has to invest with caution and any investment which attracts above normal returns generally carries above normal risks <e> <s> further anyone who invests should never put the whole of his eggs in one basket in any circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely going to ask the secretary of state whether he is aware that i am most grateful to him for the hint that he gave to the noble lord sitting behind him <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord elton for the very useful series of non-question information he gave us <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will stick to their views on an issue that is absolutely plain and has been clearly stated by various speakers <e> <s> the noble lord lord swinfen wants to remove what he calls discrimination i think that that was the word he used against the current tenant of a specific property <e> <s> the method that he proposes is to impose discrimination on all those unknown future disabled people who might want and need to rent that very same property <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> i am wholly in support of the governments attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the secretary of state for repeating the statement <e> <s> its contents are mixed <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister by any chance worked out a cost-benefit analysis of the amount and if so can he give the house a rough indication of what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in total support of the noble baroness when the amendment first came before your lordships house and i still hold that view <e> <s> however that is not the issue that we are now discussing <e> <s> i wish to ask the leader of the house whether he has sufficiently protected the rights of your lordships house in what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot allow that to be said <e> <s> i never suggested that at all <e> <s> i said two or three times that i accept without hesitation i used the words without hesitation the right of the other place to do what it has done <e> <s> if i am pressed i am criticising the leader of the house for his lack of protection of the privileges of this house <e> <s> he could have done so by using a form of words for which there are precedents in the plural during the course of his speech which would not have affected our voting at all and which would not have affected the privileges of another place but made clear that we are not agreeing to reduce the privileges of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords from the words used by the mover of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very short my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there would be more enthusiasm in the approach of industry in preparing for if there was more enthusiasm in the approach from on high <e>", "<cs> my lords before the motion is formally dealt with perhaps i may raise a point <e> <s> i hope that the minister realises the only reason why there have been two speeches against the proposals in this bill <e> <s> all those who have been concerned as i was privileged to be concerned when the noble lord lord callaghan was chancellor of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my gratitude to the noble baroness <e> <s> i start by reminding your lordships that the british people are to be distinguished from all others on this one count <e> <s> since the beginning of this century they have displayed a propensity to borrow more and to eat more of their seedcorn than any other competitive nation <e> <s> that is a deeply ingrained pattern of which we should be aware <e> <s> if the strength of the nation is based on investment to secure increased living standards in the future and investment supported by saving and not spending and borrowing then what this nation needs is to be aware the whole time of its propensity to eat its seedcorn and its need to save more and more <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him but he must make clear to the house that half of that mortgage interest leaks out into the consumption economy through some means or other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord lord stoddart for airing a generally felt grievance <e> <s> i hope that he will not regard me as discourteous if i say that perhaps a little of the edge of his argument was taken off when he made it perfectly clear that all he was doing was arranging for me to have an opportunity to straighten my tie before going to the guillotine <e> <s> that is not a very serious proposition <e> <s> despite what i imagine the noble lord lord ponsonby is going to tell us the labour party official policy is that the house of lords should be abolished in its present form but not immediately and for that we are very grateful <e> <s> that is not my view and of course i no longer have the privilege of being a member of that party <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to get bogged down with the detail otherwise it would take too long <e> <s> we have had this point many times before and this is mainly what occurs <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down from her vast experience and hard work may i ask her what proposals her group is making about elder daughters being ignored in respect of attending your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting because i know that the chief whip does not like it <e> <s> i have followed his speech with almost complete sympathy <e> <s> however the fact is that at the time it came back to us it was new matter and therefore by all logic precedent and practice we had the right to discuss it and vote on it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the statement he made that there will always be low wages is reminiscent of the phrase that the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave a very interesting figure just now <e> <s> can he give the figure as a proportion of the total takings and the total fares received <e> <s> he referred to the millions of pounds being lost each year through fraud <e> <s> i believe the minister mentioned the figure of million <e>", "<cs> my lords when i see an amendment down in the names of the noble viscount lord caldecote and the noble lords lord ezra and lord gregson i find it is scarcely necessary to read or listen to what they have to say as it will obviously be a wise proposal <e> <s> but i am bound to say that i do not find myself wholly satisfied that this is a necessary and wise proposal <e> <s> therefore i want to ask the government to clear up some points because unfortunately i was not present in committee when all this was thoroughly discussed <e> <s> i apologise profusely beforehand if my questions were fully answered at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house in advance for the fact that i did not even attend the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i apologise again if all this ground has already been covered <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an excellent report as one would expect from the excellence of the individuals who composed the committee <e> <s> i want to make it clear that my noble friends and i endorse every one of its recommendations and conclusions <e> <s> i want also to thank all the members of the committee of which i was not a member for their work and constructive thinking <e> <s> i want to thank the government for continuing to regard your lordships select committee on european affairs with the same authority as they have ever since i was connected with it which has enabled civil servants of top quality to give evidence to the select committee and therefore enabled it to produce such excellent reports <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble baroness for her introduction to this bill i hope she will not regard that as the conventional start to a speech as is regular in your lordships house it is due to the fact that i have listened to the noble baroness on many occasions and i have always been impressed by her courtesy and her clarity <e> <s> i look forward for a long time to having the opportunity of saying so <e> <s> i can only hope that what i am about to say does not do her too much harm <e>", "<cs> my lords inasmuch as i spent the majority of my second reading speech in appealing to the government and giving the reasons why <e>", "<cs> my lords before <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a really important point to make which i shall make as shortly as i can <e> <s> i realise how long we have been discussing this <e> <s> if this bill had been introduced in the form which now applies that is to say there was a proposal by the government to select certain activities out of the industry for privatisation and to leave others would it not have taken on the nature of a hybrid bill and therefore have had to be considered in the way in which hybrid bills have to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> will he explain in more detail what will happen about the cost of electricity to the consumer in scotland <e> <s> have we a final conclusion as to what the nuclear decommissioning costs and therefore the total cost of nuclear electricity generation will be <e> <s> will the consumer in scotland have to pay the cost willy-nilly because it has been passed on by government fiat <e> <s> will the watchdog set up under the legislation have the same powers on government retained activities as it has on the commercial activities and thus protect the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the matter of social justice surely the government will do something for that poor director who found his salary slashed last year to a little over <e>", "<cs> my lords does that include the vast increase in the number of people sleeping rough <e>", "<cs> my lords i count myself both fortunate and privileged to have heard the two opening speeches of the noble lords lord williams of elvel and lord jenkins of hillhead which dealt so persuasively and in my view completely satisfactorily with the two major issues facing the country at the present time <e> <s> those two speeches together with the well informed speech to which we have just listened leave little more to be said <e> <s> nevertheless having prepared a comment or two i propose to burden your lordships with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the common theme running through every speech so far and i have listened to every one from all sides of the house has been the anxiety and uncertainty which speakers all of them extremely well informed have expressed not just about nuclear generation but about the electricity industry as a whole <e> <s> in particular however they have expressed concern about what is going to happen as a result of the governments change of plan with regard to nuclear generation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that he will accept that i have been carrying out my duty on a very similar strain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the witness of the noble lord who was in the other place at that time is more reliable than mine <e> <s> i do not recollect whether that was so <e> <s> but i know that the public bill office had not put the matter to the examiners who in turn had not said that the ship repair bill was a hybrid bill otherwise it would not have started its passage through the other place before reaching this house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the gdp which the conservative government inherited was as modest as the noble lord claims it to be can he explain how it came about that it fell in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise immediately to thank the noble lord the minister for having repeated the statement and to welcome the governments novelty in introducing proposals which on first reading give the impression of having been carefully thought through <e> <s> that is indeed most welcome <e> <s> but that it not beyond what all of us would expect who knew the right honourable gentlemen the foreign secretary while he was still in the diplomatic service <e>", "<cs> my lords we should certainly consider ourselves fortunate to have been able to listen to such a well-informed and timely maiden speech as that recently made by the noble lord lord sharp of grimsdyke <e> <s> it is indeed fortunate that with his enormous knowledge of affairs in hong kong he is able to speak at this time <e> <s> i congratulate him most heartily on his speech and in particular on its confidence-building atmosphere <e> <s> too many of the speeches that we make in our attempts to improve the situation ignore the fact that our first duty is to restore not to destroy confidence in the future of hong kong <e> <s> i therefore repeat my congratulations to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> it is with great sincerity that i thank the noble and learned lord for having dealt with the matter so fully and as one would expect so reasonably <e> <s> i look forward to the next stages <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not very evident that the government have totally underestimated the seriousness of this situation <e> <s> there are two reasons for saying that <e> <s> the first is that this matter which is described by the government as a dirty tricks campaign appears to uninitiated minds like my own not necessarily to be the kind of case where everybody who has succeeded in hiding something for years will now come forward voluntarily and present all the papers and information about the matter <e> <s> is it not the case that with this dirty tricks campaign the reputation of the secret services upon which this country relies will never be cleared <e> <s> is this not a constitutional matter which has been seriously misjudged and underestimated by the government <e> <s> if that were not the case the leader of the house would have thought it proper to take this matter up <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord referred to these arrangements being unenforceable <e> <s> he has referred to them as being illegal <e> <s> are they illegal and therefore unenforceable or are they only unenforceable <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord states that we go on and on he means that new legislation could be put before your lordships <e> <s> your lordships would then have an opportunity of deciding in the light of what has happened and in the light of further evidence whether to take a certain view <e> <s> that is the point that we are deciding today <e> <s> the idea that the bill commits us to all kinds of provisions that are not wanted is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble lord lord rippon for initiating this important debate <e> <s> i doubt whether any of your lordships would disagree with the main point that he made <e> <s> he said that parliamentary scrutiny was inadequate <e> <s> he has put before us a proposal for improving that situation <e> <s> i fully support what he has proposed but it does not go far enough <e>", "<cs> my lords while we all recognise that high interest rates have their effect on reducing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to underline that courtesy <e> <s> i draw attention to what the minister said as i understood it that where as in this case a bill was introduced which was not complete as is shown by its history that was the responsibility of the minister himself <e> <s> it was not that of the civil servants who have been criticised in this house quite improperly on an occasion like this <e> <s> they were criticised improperly and at length only yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead once again and i am sure that i am expressing the views of the whole house when i thank him for bringing this important and contentious matter to our attention in the form of the debate which is taking place today <e> <s> in the short time which is available to me i do not think that i can do more than explain why i find myself in the very unhappy position of not only having to disagree slightly with some of the remarks made by the noble lord but also having to agree with the secretary of state in his decision to take no further action in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earls view that the policy of her majestys government is the same now as it was when the noble lord lord young had responsibility on the front bench opposite for these matters and expounded the view that it does not matter how much your manufacturing trade falls the slack will automatically be taken up by an increase in services <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me particular pleasure to follow the noble lord lord somers my twin <e> <s> his experience of this house in years is exactly double mine that is years against but the number of years for which we have been on the earth is exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may be allowed to contribute a few words on this sad occasion of the death of a good friend and a most likeable man <e> <s> i too have known him for over years <e> <s> i found him one of the easiest of men to work with whom i have ever come across because he seemed to bring to his work not only the qualities which we have all observed but also a fund of goodwill understanding and patience which he could draw on to make difficult moments a little easier <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount care to reconsider his off-the-cuff comment that steel and coal are industries of yesteryear <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal in the statement for which we can be grateful <e> <s> i welcome much of what has been said <e> <s> i believe this meeting was successful but it also underlines the value of continuing meetings of this kind where heads of state are prepared to discuss their different points of view on world matters with one another <e> <s> that is a healthy development and should be continued <e> <s> the comments in the communiqu on international trade are encouraging and very welcome <e> <s> apart from a number of minor points including the question which the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead asked and to which he did not receive a reply i would have asked the question had he not asked it namely what additional significance is to be attached to the word up in the term freeing up something or other there is one major matter on which i am uneasy <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in my understanding that as a result of the new arrangements for separate assessment of husband and wife those of us who are fortunate enough and rich enough to have wives who as well as ourselves have large investments on which they make capital gains will have double the capital gains tax relief that previously existed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am one of the no doubt many recipients of the letter from the westminster hospital to which reference was made and which the minister said had not been brought to her attention <e> <s> perhaps she would be good enough to let me know whether she has any difficulty in seeing the letter in which case i can show her a copy <e> <s> rather more seriously with regard to the information that she said <e>"]
