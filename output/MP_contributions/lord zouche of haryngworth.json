["<cs> my lords i rise to address your lordships for the first time <e> <s> i have to admit that i find the task most daunting <e> <s> i understand that the tradition of your lordships house requires that a maiden speech should be non-controversial <e> <s> in choosing to speak to this bill i could hardly have selected a more controversial issue but i shall take this opportunity to speak on an aspect of transport provision that must surely ride above the level of politics <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to ask him whether the government are aware of any johnson matthey bankers customers who have had their loans withdrawn or lines of credit curtailed because of the johnson matthey bankers collapse <e> <s> if this has occurred will these lines of credit or loans be reinstated by johnson matthey bankers or the bank of england <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend the minister <e> <s> he assured the committee that he will impose a requirement on local authorities <e> <s> although i do not believe that that is exactly what has been asked for it will go a long way down the road to achieve the end desired <e> <s> as i outlined in my maiden speech i feel very strongly indeed about the disabled but i want to support the minister in this because i think that at the end of the day the disabled will get a good deal after his assurances <e> <s> i believe what he said has put us a lot further down the road <e>"]
