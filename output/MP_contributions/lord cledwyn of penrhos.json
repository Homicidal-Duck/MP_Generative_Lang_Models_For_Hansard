["<cs> my lords i have been in this house for long enough to realise the great kindness and consideration that is shown to new members and that the indulgence of the house is readily given <e> <s> like my noble friends who have spoken i have also been advised that i should be short and uncontroversial both now and on future occasions <e> <s> i shall do my best to comply although the second injunction tends to clip ones wings considerably <e> <s> it is very agreeable that i should be making a maiden speech at the same time as my noble friend lord ross and the noble lord lord godber of willington <e> <s> all of us at one stage or another took a close interest in the agricultural industry as indeed did my noble friend lord peart and the noble viscount lord amory <e> <s> former ministers of agriculture are much thicker on the ground in this house than former secretaries of state for wales <e> <s> i understand from my noble friend lord ross that a large number of former scottish secretaries are here <e> <s> but i am the only former secretary of state for wales although no doubt others will follow in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too wish the noble lord lord soames complete success on his critical mission and also congratulate the noble lord the foreign and commonwealth secretary on his considerable achievement <e> <s> may i press him on one point namely the relationship of the new governor with the armed forces of zimbabwe-rhodesia which have recently been making incursions over the border <e> <s> is the noble lord satisfied that when the new governor takes residence he will have some control over the zimbabwe-rhodesia forces and that from that point of view there will be a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister of state aware that subject to what my noble friends have said about increased prices there are considerable remaining problems <e> <s> can he be rather more precise about the increase in real farm income which will result from this per cent <e> <s> devaluation <e> <s> secondly rather more broadly and fundamentally can he say to what extent the government are still hoping that there could be a more radical reform of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> is there not a danger that we go from package to package and i am not expressing this as a view of any one political party mollifying this sector or that sector but failing to impress upon our partners in the community that we shall not come to a satisfactory conclusion until we have a real reform of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> can the noble earl say what hope the government have of achieving that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that those millions of people in the third world who are living in circumstances of the grimmest poverty and disease are living in the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that i speak for the whole house when i say that we are grateful to my noble friend lord brooks of tremorfa for initiating this debate and for his excellent opening speech <e> <s> his long experience of public life in south wales qualifies him to speak with great authority on welsh problems and the government will do well to heed the powerful arguments which he has advanced this evening <e> <s> it is sometimes said that politicians are prone to exaggeration <e> <s> there is perhaps some truth in this from time to time but my noble friend lord brooks of tremorfa did not exaggerate in his speech today <e> <s> he described the scene starkly as it is he described the fears and apprehensions of the people of wales and he spoke the truth <e> <s> we are all grateful to him <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate the noble lord lord hooson on his maiden speech <e> <s> he and i are very old friends <e> <s> he made a characteristically well-informed speech and the house will look forward to hearing a great deal from him again <e> <s> there is no greater expert certainly on the problems of rural mid-wales than the noble lord lord hooson <e>", "<cs> my <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully support the case which has been put so well by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> the amendment was fully explained to the committee and to the government and i regret that i was not able to be present at that time to speak to it <e> <s> but i thought that the arguments were so conclusive that there would be no doubt of the governments reaction <e> <s> i am very deeply disappointed by the response of the government as i see it in the amendments to clause on the marshalled list tonight <e> <s> the amendments which they have seen fit to put down do not allay my fears about the consequences of clause as it now stands or the consequences of clause as amended by the governments amendments to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord deal rather more specifically with some of the points that have been raised by noble lords <e> <s> given that the agricultural marketing boards have been in existence for many years indeed the milk marketing board has been in existence for over half a century is there any evidence over the whole of that period that these boards should be referred to the monopolies commission or to an efficiency audit <e> <s> has any new evidence come to hand in recent months or years which prompts the government to take this quite extraordinary action <e> <s> what is worrying noble lords is that the agricultural marketing boards will now be the only organisations which will be subject to two acts of parliament <e> <s> other organisations will be subject to this act the agricultural marketing boards will be subject to this act and also to the agricultural marketing act <e> <s> an additional burden is being placed on them which does not apply to the other boards about which the noble lord lord mottistone is so concerned <e> <s> can the noble lord deal with that <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord is not being fair to me or to the house <e> <s> he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of the house for intervening once again <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister of state for his intervention <e> <s> it is always agreeable to listen to the minister of state but he has not helped me a great deal <e> <s> he has not taken account of the fact that these agricultural boards have statutory obligations and that they are very much under ministerial control as it is <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that the milk marketing board has been under ministerial control from the start and that milk is one of the most important commodities so far as the consumer is concerned <e> <s> the price of milk is strictly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i am extremely disappointed with the response that the minister has given to noble lords who have raised the matter and with the response of the government generally <e> <s> it is an extremely important point <e> <s> if the noble lord informs the house that the minister of agriculture will be aware of what takes place i would tend to be rather less discontent than i am now <e> <s> the thought that the agricultural marketing boards are going to be subjected to this procedure without the immediate and direct knowledge of the minister of agriculture seems very unreasonable indeed <e> <s> if we are going to get co-operation in the agricultural industry and if the country is going to get the co-operation of the agricultural industry and that seems very important indeed the government must be more reasonable <e> <s> after all if the agricultural marketing boards are responsible to anyone they are responsible to the <e>", "<cs> the answer my lords to the noble lord is that they are not the responsibility of the minister of agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i support all the arguments advanced by the noble lord lord stanley and i say again that i am extremely disappointed at the government <e> <s> their obstinacy is even greater than i thought it was <e> <s> this is a reasonable case <e> <s> what we are saying is that it is wrong for the agricultural marketing boards to be subjected to two procedures <e> <s> they are already subject to the procedures of the act <e> <s> this bill would make them subject to an additional procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to point out that the noble lord lord robbins is being grossly unfair <e> <s> by implication he has condemned british agriculture because of the faults of european agriculture <e> <s> the fact is that compared with european agriculture british agriculture of which he is representative as the son of a farmer has performed magnificently in the last years <e> <s> indeed from the point of view of production productivity and efficiency it has performed superbly compared with any other british industry <e> <s> i must take the noble lord to task in the unfair advantage he has taken in what he knows to be an illogical argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord stanley in the reasonable case he has made <e> <s> i do not think i have ever been in a position of losing such a good case as in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put a final question to him which i think will assist the house in coming to a conclusion <e> <s> if the act is as unsatisfactory as he now seems to imply that it is why has it taken years for the noble lord and his government to decide to introduce these new additional measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his assistance <e> <s> before he sits down will the noble lord lord mottistone agree that the other companies boards and <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the derelict land unit which i set up in the welsh office after the aberfan disaster of has done the most remarkably good work <e> <s> may i ask him what steps the government are taking to encourage the derelict land unit to extend its operations not only in wales but in england and scotland as well <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood for a thoughtful and well argued speech which i am sure the house enjoyed very much and for her kind references to me which i greatly appreciated <e> <s> during the short period that i was in the chair in the absence of my noble friend lord walston it was a pleasure to work with the noble baroness and with other noble lords and if i may say so it is the general view of the committee that the noble baroness brings to the committee a wealth of practical knowledge a great understanding and great compassion and we much enjoyed her company there <e>", "<cs> i will if i may confine my remarks for the sake of brevity to the problem posed in the bill for the welsh development agency <e> <s> no one i think on either side of the house would doubt the importance of the welsh development agency certainly there is no one of whatever political complexion in wales who would seek to argue today that the welsh development agency is not an essential instrument for the purpose of seeking to resolve some of the more acute problems which confront the principality at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord has just said is very important <e> <s> what he has just said is that there is a possibility that a very large number of bogus language students are in this country <e> <s> could he give an estimate or has his department any estimate of the number of any bogus students that there may be <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord lee of newton has just said we had a fairly full debate on this clause during the committee stage but i am bound to say that i am still not quite clear what are its full implications for the welsh development agency <e> <s> the minister when he spoke in committee gave me a clear impression that the functions of the welsh development agency will remain more or less unimpaired as a result of the bill and i should like him to confirm that statement today <e> <s> if this be the case then part of my apprehension is removed although my noble friend lord lee has again created some fairly grave doubts in my mind <e>", "<cs> would the noble viscount please answer the latter part of my question namely whether the million is intended to be directed to those areas which are affected by steel closures in wales and not to the rest of the development area which is to lose million a year from onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the government propose to do two things first to reduce the size of the civil service and secondly to remove inefficiency in the civil service <e> <s> can the noble lord indicate to the house where in his view and in the governments view this inefficiency occurs and precisely what plans the government have to improve the efficiency of the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those of my noble friend upon the statement which the noble earl has just read <e> <s> my congratulations are extended to certain aspects of the report but not to the report in its totality because i think it is a report of such detail that noble lords will wish for a great deal more time to study it before they come to a final judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords while everyone agrees that good husbandry in local government is absolutely essential is the noble lord aware that there are areas of the country like the rural areas of wales the provinces of gwynedd and powys where unemployment is unacceptably high running at the rate of per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and where local government is a major and essential employer of labour in addition to being a provider of services <e> <s> will the noble lord and the government bear that in mind when they talk about reducing manpower in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords they are doing precisely that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of these unhappy and unfortunate events is the noble lord in a position to say whether the government believe that independence can be granted on the date which was agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not need an optimist to believe that the prime minister would accept proportional representation <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow and support what <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord can confirm one point which i do not necessarily refer to in a spirit of criticism <e> <s> as i understand it the provision would place the tenant who is in the circumstances outlined in a much more favourable position than the private tenant who is in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is normally clear but he is less than clear and less than precise on this occasion <e> <s> he said something rather strange a moment ago <e> <s> as i understood him he said it was up to the local authorities themselves to designate what is a rural area <e> <s> if not perhaps he would clarify that for the committee <e> <s> but if indeed it is up to the local authority the housing authority to designate what is a rural area within their district what are the procedures to be <e> <s> would he be good enough to give the committee guidance <e> <s> what must they do <e> <s> are further orders to be produced <e> <s> are they to be affirmative or negative orders <e> <s> are they to come before parliament <e> <s> before we go any further the noble lord must give us a little more guidance as to exactly what he meant <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the most effective contribution to the community in the form of civic service and to industry as well be to extend apprenticeship schemes in essential industry <e> <s> could the noble lord say what plans the government have to this end and how much the government are now spending through the msc on the granting of apprenticeships to young people <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened with great interest to the speech we have heard from the noble lord lord hill of luton <e> <s> the noble lord speaks with great authority indeed he is unique in the sense that he is the only one to have occupied the chairs of both authorities and therefore what he says is of importance and must be listened to with great respect <e> <s> i noted what he said about the future of this place and he spoke very persuasively about the televising of parliament <e> <s> as to the future of this place what i hear and all the evidence points to this is that the reputation of this house has risen considerably since people have been able to listen to the broadcasting of its proceedings the prestige and authority of this house certainly seem to have increased in recent years as a result of the broadcasting of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that amount of clarification if in fact <e> <s> as he said the government had changed their mind by the time of the queens speech then that should have been made clear because so far as wales was concerned we were not aware that the government had changed their mind until the home secretary made his speech in cambridge on lth september <e> <s> the noble lord has made an extremely serious statement <e> <s> it was certainly not clear to anyone of us at all that the government had changed their mind in the wording in the gracious speech <e> <s> this was really not a satisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> i only hope now that the government can be persuaded to change their mind again <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord be a little more forthcoming <e> <s> is he aware that the irish tourist traffic is very important to the welsh ports of holyhead fishguard and <e>", "<cs> i warmly support the new clause that has been ably moved by the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> this is not an hour of the day on which to dilate on any subject even one as important as this so i propose to be very brief and to make two points <e> <s> first we have as a country suffered a severe blow in the curtailment of our traditional fishing grounds and fish farming needs to be encouraged both by the government and by parliament <e> <s> of course we know that there are imponderables in relation to fish farming and one wishes that one had more time to talk about these <e> <s> but the industry is now well based with production at about tonnes per annum <e> <s> i think that one should pay a tribute to the government and to successive governments for the contribution that they have made and will make towards research in fish farming <e> <s> i do not think that this small industry in fact is asking for grants and subsidies <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord the minister of state for the way in which he has introduced the governments new proposals <e> <s> during the second reading debate on th july i indicated my very deep concern about the possible course of events in wales if this bill was passed without amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i said then for the scene has changed and the mood is very different in wales <e> <s> this is because the government after careful consideration and after listening to representations from a wide range of people have decided to revert to their original policy that is to broadcast welsh language television programmes on a single channel <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i would ask him to do more than write me a letter <e> <s> i would like him to be good enough to come back and report and make a point on this because i do not want it to go beyond the third reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord expect support from the benches behind him and in the other place when his policies and his batting have produced million not out <e>", "<cs> my lords i was listening <e>", "<cs> wish to make a few observations in support of that speech by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i agree with him when he says that this clause and this group of amendments is of profound significance to the agriculture industry of that there can be no doubt <e> <s> there has been as he said a progressive decline in the area of good agricultural land in the united kingdom <e> <s> we know that it is required for other reasons and they are mainly good reasons or so it could be argued <e> <s> for example land is needed for industrial development housing estates schools hospitals and roads all of which are good reasons which deserve support <e> <s> but agricultural land is currently being lost at the rate of acres per annum and about hectares have been lost to agriculture since the last war <e> <s> the situation must therefore be watched carefully <e> <s> this does not mean to say that the land cannot be used for other purposes but we must watch it very carefully <e>", "<cs> whose advocacy is virtually irrcssistable to a welshman <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin made an impressive reply to the debate <e> <s> the committee are grateful to him for that <e> <s> may i put one point to him namely the case where the minister of agriculture still has an outstanding objection after a council has declared its intentions <e> <s> i suggested that it would be prudent in the interests of the agricultural industry generally and the country that that should be available to be called in so that there could be a discussion between his right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment and the minister of agriculture <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether there has been full discussion between his department and the ministry of agriculture on this point and whether the minister of agriculture and the noble earl lord ferrers are aware of the point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> but he would of course understand that in the case of a motorway there would be a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> without question <e>", "<cs> this will be much appreciated in wales and i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not realise that his government could do with a little popularity and this is what we are trying to help him with <e>", "<cs> i should not like the opportunity to pass without thanking the noble lord for tabling this amendment and the previous ones which he moved formally in furtherance of the governments undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords as the pulp mill at ellesmere port has been closed can the noble earl say where the output of the welsh forests will now go <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a satisfactory answer <e> <s> can the noble earl not be more specific <e> <s> is he not aware that unemployment in wales is very high indeed and that this is causing considerable concern in the principality <e> <s> forestry makes an economic contribution and if the welsh forests are affected because there is no output the consequences can be very serious <e> <s> i would be very grateful if the noble earl could give me a more particular reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl really is fobbing me off <e> <s> will he be good enough if he does not know to find out where the output of the welsh forests will go and let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank my noble friend lord walston for the able and comprehensive speech with which he opened the debate <e> <s> with the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood i pay warm tribute to my noble friend for his most distinguished tenure as chairman of our select committee d on agriculture and food <e> <s> it has been a pleasure to be a member of that committee with him and i only hope that his successor will do one-tenth as well as he has done during the last three years <e>", "<cs> my lords in his statement the noble lord referred specifically to england <e> <s> may we take it that this dismal proposal does not in fact extend to wales <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the lord chancellor for his consideration <e> <s> the noble lords whose names appear on the list seem to me to be entirely admirable in every way in order to fulfil the important task given to them <e> <s> however it occurs to me that none of these noble lords comes from wales nor lives in wales <e> <s> the unemployment situation in wales is of the utmost gravity <e> <s> it is probably as bad as if not worse than that in any other part of the united kingdom <e> <s> if i may i should like with respect and all courtesy to <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a wide-ranging and serious debate and the speeches without exception have drawn attention to the gravity of the problems which bedevil the world scene <e> <s> when the noble lord lord trefgarne resumes his seat the house will have heard speeches and many of them have been what i might call specialist speeches <e> <s> the noble lord lord auckland dealt with the caribbeans the noble baroness lady vickers delivered a very well informed speech on indonesia the noble lord lord chitnis spoke about the stark and grim situation in el salvador <e> <s> it is hard to find a glimmer of light anywhere <e> <s> we are in the words of the hymn amid encircling gloom and the world needs leading out of it <e> <s> i should not be winding up the debate for the opposition were it not for the temporary indisposition of my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies <e> <s> i know that the house will miss her contribution this evening and will be glad to see her return to her customary place on the front bench within a few days <e>", "<cs> my lords conferences of political parties tend to pass resolutions from time to time and those resolutions are also changed from time to time <e> <s> it is something within the recollection and the history of all political parties <e> <s> but as i said before the noble lord should look at his own party should be concerned about his own party and should talk to his own leader <e> <s> he will see that there is precisely the same concern there as exists among many of us in the labour party <e> <s> i do not object to the noble lord criticising and he is perfectly right to do so <e> <s> but he ought to look at the balance of the argument before he begins to go too far along that road <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the problem of unemployment is as serious in the rural areas as it is in the urban areas <e> <s> will he ensure that these projects are extended to small employers in villages and in the rural areas of the country generally <e>", "<cs> my lords although much of the criticism which has been made is valid is it not also true to say that the inter-city line in britain is one of the best in the world <e> <s> furthermore would the noble earl ensure that the cambrian coastline railway one of the most picturesque and important in britain is kept open <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble and learned friend in the welcome that he has extended to these regulations <e> <s> they will be greatly appreciated in wales and particularly in those areas of wales where welsh is generally spoken and in some cases where welsh is by far and away the primary language <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to define what is meant by the request and consent of canada <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect that avoids the question entirely <e> <s> does it mean the provincial government the federal government or both <e> <s> would the noble lord be more precise <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too welcome the ministers statement and express the fervent wish that there is a successful outcome to the negotiations <e> <s> may i also express the hope that the south wales miners will now return to work pending the conclusion of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the chief obstacle to the establishment of small industries in rural areas where they are badly needed is not the planning authorities but generally the economic policies of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the role of the local authorities in providing employment through the building of houses and roads and through infrastructure work generally is absolutely crucial in areas of high unemployment such as those in wales <e> <s> is he aware that the situation in for example gwynedd in north wales is approaching disaster <e> <s> does he not believe that the government should now change their policies and encourage local authorities to carry out essential work so as to reduce the unemployment figures <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether these workshops are being built in the areas of highest unemployment <e> <s> is he aware that the unemployment situation throughout wales is grave and is becoming more serious month by month <e> <s> if these workshops are indeed a success story can he say how many of them are being built in wales at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has just stressed the benefits of co-operation between ourselves and our partners in the common market <e> <s> how does he reconcile that with the fact that we are competing with the french in the sale of armaments to the middle east <e>", "<cs> like the two noble lords who have spoken i too am disappointed with the minister of states reply <e> <s> i thought that on this occasion he could have been more forthcoming because contrary to what he has just said about appeals to fling around scarce resources we are not in fact asking for any money for fish farmers at this time <e> <s> what we are asking for is that in this legislation proper preparation should be made for the future <e> <s> the noble earl lord mansfield said that if and when it is necessary the government will act swiftly <e> <s> i am sure that his own personal intentions are good because he expressed sympathy for the industry <e> <s> but he knows and the house knows that when the time comes governments cannot act swiftly on a matter of legislation <e>", "<cs> for the noble lord to say that he will take it away and look at it is not the cowards way out <e> <s> it is the path of future prime ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords does what the minister has said mean that he is absolutely satisfied that the same standard of vigilance is kept today as was kept before industrial action was taken <e> <s> is he satisfied that all the procedures which successive governments have followed under the rabies act are being followed <e> <s> procedures which have been successful in keeping this dreadful disease from this country thus far <e> <s> further is he able to give us any statistics as to the number of dogs in quarantine now and the number before <e> <s> would that lead us to have confidence that the right degree of vigilance is being maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to be a little more specific <e> <s> is he aware that the unemployment situation in wales is particularly bad and that outside of northern ireland the figures for wales are now the worst for the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> is he aware that this kind of scheme would be particularly helpful in the rural areas of wales <e> <s> can he say how the scheme is working in wales at the present time and whether he is satisfied that we are making progress <e>", "<cs> my lords my first and pleasant task is to congratulate the three maiden speakers in this debate <e> <s> i see the spires of lichfield cathedral as i travel home to anglesey every week <e> <s> they are an expression of hope in an uncertain age and the speech of the right reverend prelate was also a message of hope which was based on his considerable experience not only in this country but in africa as well <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff had a rather different perspective <e> <s> he is a distinguished historian and he made a thoughtful speech <e> <s> his references particularly to the laws and <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for more than a moment or two but i should like to say that although this has been a short debate it has been an extremely valuable one <e> <s> on behalf of the members of the committee i should like to say how much we appreciated the generous remarks which have been made about the committees work and about this report in particular by the noble earl the minister and by my noble friend lord peart <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the work of the ncc may i ask whether the noble lord would answer three short questions first what constraints would notification place upon owners lessees or occupiers of farms in this area <e> <s> secondly are the resources available to compensate farmers for any restrictions placed upon them and what resources does the noble lord think will be necessary for that purpose <e> <s> thirdly have discussions been held with interested authorities in the area that is local authorities or branches of the two farmers unions in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say more about the functions of the co-ordinator <e> <s> although the appointment is a very good one could he say how much authority the co-ordinator has <e> <s> what precisely does he do <e> <s> is he much more than an adviser <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that before one can establish small or large businesses in rural areas one must have the adequate infrastructure <e> <s> is he further aware that the infrastructure costs a great deal of money <e> <s> in addition to the scheme he is now describing which is welcome what plans have the government to ease the real financial problems of the local authorities in rural areas to enable them to help small industries so that jobs can be found which i think is of primary importance <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount be good enough to say what percentage of the money so far made available under the scheme has gone to the development areas and the special development areas <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a constructive debate on the report and i am grateful to all noble lords in all parts of the house for the speeches they have made and for the kind things they have said about the report which sub-committee d has produced <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble earl the minister for the speech he has just made in which he explained the attitude and policies of his department towards this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords if the situation in perivale is serious the situation in merthyr tydfil where hoover also have a large plant is infinitely more serious <e> <s> as the noble earl will be well aware the unemployment figure in wales is extraordinarily grave at the present time <e> <s> can the noble earl say what steps are being taken by the national enterprise board which his government have largely emasculated in relation to hoover nationally and what steps the welsh development agency are taking in wales to assist those who have been made redundant and unemployed in the merthyr tydfil area <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount give some indication of the percentage of the new businesses which are in the engineering industry and in other productive industries which may be of use to the country in the coming years <e> <s> can he also give a spread of the industries in the country as a whole and say how many of them for example are in the north-east how many are in the london area how many are in scotland and how many are in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate with differing views clearly expressed in all parts of the house <e> <s> i should like to follow noble lords who have expressed gratitude to my noble friend lord noel-baker for tabling his motion and for the thoughtful speech with which he opened this debate <e> <s> my noble friend as several noble lords have said has a remarkable record of working for peaceful solutions of the grim problems which face the world but he has done so throughout a long and active life without a faltering of resolve or a loss of idealism <e> <s> i remember attending a public meeting in anglesey as a schoolboy when my noble friend spoke about the league of nations and the lasting impression he made upon me and others years or so ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to

pleasure of knowing the noble lords grandfather who came from anglesey <e> <s> he would have been proud to listen to the noble lord and especially to hear the contents of his speech today <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i am making of course is that an individual who say lives in a house which was bought by his grandfather and has five years of the term of the lease left is not going to get a loan

leasehold system which have been lauded by the noble earl lord kinnoull i am afraid are massively outweighed by the inequities of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords the contracts to which the noble lord has referred were as he knows made about years or more ago <e> <s> he said they were entered into by mutual agreement <e> <s> would he deal with this point namely that the lessee at that time had no alternative <e> <s> could the noble lord tell the house what alternative the lessee had if he wanted a roof above his head for himself and his family <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble

my neighbour here in london and very often we walked home together at night <e> <s> we all found him a man of wide knowledge and compassion <e> <s> ritchie-calder was in a true sense a citizen of the

can explain how it is that we are unable to waive the rule whereas the scandinavian countries appear to be able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what effect the savage cuts which the government have imposed on british universities will have on the important part which the minister obviously expects the universities to play in this very important scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords we are

knowledge and practical experience of southern africa <e> <s> my noble friend has raised a number of important practical points about resolution and has made a number of serious allegations about departures from the operation of resolution with which i feel sure the minister will wish to deal in his reply <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords would one be right in thinking that this committee will be expected to carry out the same kind of exercise as that which the university grants committee conducted in relation to the universities <e> <s> would it also be right to assume that the government will be looking for savings of about the same percentage size as they have obtained from the universities or more <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we welcome the measures but is he certain that they are taking effect in the areas where the need is greatest <e> <s> the need is greatest in areas like blaenau gwent and the other areas mentioned by my noble friend and the areas of north wales where i live where unemployment is unacceptably high and where government help does not seem to be having any effect on the problem of rising unemployment <e> <s> the noble lord said that consultations are going on <e> <s> what does he mean by that <e> <s> this is an answer very often given by governments to get themselves off the hook <e> <s> how long are these consultations going to

system as put forward <e> <s> is there any chance that this could be amended <e> <s> if it is a major obstacle in the negotiations would it not be desirable that there should be some concession on the voting system in order to achieve a settlement as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we welcome the fact that there will not be a delay for five years <e> <s> but can he tell the house what is the difference between an enterprise zone and a special development area <e> <s> is he aware that special development areas were created in those districts which had the highest unemployment and that there are special development areas throughout the country with unemployment of over per cent <e> <s> would it not be sensible and proper if these enterprise zones have any validity to make every special development area an enterprise zone <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord has not answered my question <e> <s> i asked him whether he recognised that special development areas have the worst unemployment problem in the country <e> <s> if there is merit in the enterprise zones can he not say that he will make these special development areas enterprise zones so that they can reap the benefits which he has just described <e>", "<cs> my lords on the international section of the statement while i welcome the general remarks about poland afghanistan and the middle east can the noble lord confirm that the government are now firmly associated with other community governments in supporting negotiation on el salvador <e> <s> one had the feeling that there was a certain amount of tepidness before but one is now confirmed in the belief that the government are rather more anxious to co-operate and accept the offer of mediation by the mexican president <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can say a word about that possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the news that progress has been made with this scheme may i ask the noble viscount to be kind enough to say how many new jobs have been created in these businesses since the inception of the scheme <e> <s> can he further say what prospect there is that the upper borrowing limit might be increased from the present to something much more substantial <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier today i thought that the shadow of our debate yesterday on the oil and gas enterprise bill would rest on todays discussion but that has not been the case <e> <s> we have in fact had a most interesting debate on a subject of great public importance and interest and i should like to add my own tribute to my noble friend lord beswick for initiating the debate and for the stimulating speech with which he opened it <e> <s> i am personally grateful also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that so far as i am concerned that is a red herring drawn across the theme which i am seeking to develop <e> <s> so far as the noble lord lord tanlaw is concerned he is quite wrong

there is no detailed election manifesto that is what we are waiting for in his party in the noble lords party or in our own party <e> <s> but our business at the moment is not to criticise the election attitudes of opposition parties but to scrutinise the policies of the government in power <e> <s> that is our job and that is what i am trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the secretary of state for wales is responsible for education in wales in its totality would it not have been appropriate to set up comparable councils in wales to deal with examinations and with curricula <e> <s> to what extent was thought given to this <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there is a strong tradition of education in wales that there are national educational bodies in wales and that there was expectation that the government would have given consideration to the welsh identity in this respect <e> <s> it was a new opportunity for them to do so <e> <s> will the noble lord convey this view to his right honourable friend if his right honourable friend has not already thought of this <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government now proposing to bring scotland within the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be good enough to say what percentage of the total was attributable to wastage what percentage was attributable to compulsory redundancy and what percentage was attributable to voluntary redundancy <e>", "<cs> while welcoming that information my lords may i ask whether the minister can confirm that the starts are evenly spread throughout the country <e>

agree that that information is important <e> <s> does he agree that it is vital that there should be an even spread otherwise the increases in building are likely to be in the more prosperous parts of the country whereas those areas which really need new housing and jobs will not be able to benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my appreciation to all noble lords who spoke in the debate which has been helpful and comprehensive <e> <s> as she is the only baroness in our committee may i refer specifically to the noble baroness lady elliot and thank her for her contribution which was full of common sense and knowledge of the problems <e> <s> the noble baroness spoke of the working party on the conditions of competition in agriculture <e> <s> she will recall that the working party was discussed by the subcommittee and we were told a little about its work by a senior ministry official perhaps noble lords would refer to questions nos <e> <s> and where the official quoted the minister as saying that it might become more of an investigative body <e> <s> i am not sure that the commission share that view at present <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord confirm that it is also government policy to dispose of those parts of state-owned corporations and i am quoting from my noble friends question which are making a profit and to leave the ones not making a profit in public hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always patient in relation to the noble lord and i am prepared to be so <e> <s> of course one has to agree with what he said about the procedure in relation to another place <e> <s> but in his reply he referred to the policies of the government as adumbrated in their manifesto <e> <s> therefore it is perfectly proper for supplementary questions to be put to him on the policies to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with what the noble and learned lord has just said may i ask whether a charge of treason is not absurd to the point of hysteria especially when the bbc and the itv for that matter are demonstrating to the world what a free country is really about <e> <s> if the balance appears wrong occasionally is that not due mainly to the sparse and limited information coming from the ministry of defence compared with the flood of misleading and self-righteous propaganda cascading from the controlled and repressed media in buenos aires <e> <s> is there a prospect of improvement <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble and learned lord is able to comment on this <e> <s> also could the reports coming from the ministry of defence be a little less funereal and a little more inspiring <e> <s> it seems at the moment that all that is needed is a harp accompaniment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the need for accurate reporting at this time could the noble viscount say what consultations take place between his department and the bbc and itv on these matters to which he has referred so that the reports put over by the bbc and itv can be as accurate as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect the noble viscount has not answered my question in full <e> <s> i was asking what regular consultations take place <e> <s> if they do not take place would it not be useful for such consultations to take place between representatives of the noble viscounts department and of the media <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the special arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the present support system if one looks at its operation over a period of time is biased against the british apple producer <e> <s> secondly would he agree that it is high time that the commission was pressed very hard to reduce the level of withdrawal prices for golden delicious to eliminate unfair treatment <e> <s> if this is not done then the figures which he has quoted will be perpetuated into the future and the british apple grower will continue to be unfairly treated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl about the preliminary design study for the severn barrage which as he will recall was recommended by the bondi committee and to which he referred when he wound up the debate on the severn barrage in february <e> <s> then the noble earl said that this was under consideration by the government <e> <s> can he now say whether the government have come to a conclusion because

of resources <e> <s> in view of the recent cuts imposed by the government not by the university grants committee on the universities generally can the noble lord say whether that is a factor in the consideration at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye for raising this matter of considerable importance and for a speech which

"<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the select committee on agriculture of which i have the privilege of being the chairman recommended that this proposal should be accepted and will be delighted that the government are taking this step especially in view of the fact that all the evidence before the select committee from representatives of the farmers and of the producers was of the unanimous view that this proposal should go through <e>", "<cs> my lords may i underline what my noble friend lord mackie of benshie said <e> <s> in view of the accession of greece and the probable accession of spain and portugal do the government appreciate that there is likely to be a substantial increase in the surpluses of mediterranean products especially olive oil <e> <s> if that takes

fact that the european economic community regularly produces surpluses which we really do not know what to do with and which are very often disposed of in questionable ways would it not be appropriate for her majestys government to talk not only to the french government but to the other governments of the eec with a view to ensuring that the food we produce is at least sent to those countries where

enterprise zones are not ones that move for the sake of the grants alone thereby depriving other deserving areas of jobs <e> <s> can the government also ensure that the type of firm is such that it alleviates severe unemployment rather than be of a type which is not labour intensive but which may also use a great deal of land and thereby derive substantial rate concessions from being in an enterprise zone <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> we welcome the apparently high degree of agreement which appears to have been achieved in copenhagen <e> <s> on the economic side the position clearly remains grave but we appreciate the attention which was paid to the unemployment problem in the community with million people out of work

be more forthcoming on the question of namibia and also upon the improvement of human and civil rights in south africa <e> <s> does not the noble lord feel extremely guilty that he should be answering the question in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the south african government an outstanding example of an odious and oppressive government <e> <s> does not this loan sustain one of the worst

dissidents in russia who are suffering under the soviet government one of whom i think is doctor orlov <e> <s> can the noble lord say what we are doing about that specific case <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been some talk of a request for a british training team in the lebanon <e> <s> before the government reach a final conclusion on that will they be completely satisfied that such a training team is in fact attached to a stable lebanese army and not to some faction there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made an important statement and a complicated one <e> <s> as i have only just had the opportunity of reading it a few minutes ago i think that i and the rest of the house on all sides will wish to study it carefully before we can come to any balanced conclusion about it <e> <s> i can say however that we welcome the fact that it will extend protection to our clothing and textile industries for a further period <e> <s> the new quotas are said to be and i quote the words of the noble lord rather tougher than before <e> <s> could the noble lord enlarge on that and explain to the house in simple terms how they will be tougher and how they will in fact differ from the previous

classification <e> <s> can he also indicate whether in the governments view the other countries concerned are going to subscribe to this new system <e> <s> do the government think that the united states and japan are proposing to subscribe to this <e> <s> if they do not will that affect her majestys governments decision in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> in view of the need to protect cattle and pigs against the diseases referred to in the statement we welcome the further extension of months <e> <s> we also note the proposal to discuss the introduction of new rules for trade in live animals and fresh meat within the community <e> <s> will the noble earl now give the house a firm assurance that the government will not approve any rules relating to foot and mouth disease which fall below the standards implemented by the government following the report of the northumberland inquiry after the outbreak of which was

change of course the statement does expose a very grave situation indeed <e> <s> we also believe that the governments obstinate pursuit of deflationary policies which have been followed by other western countries with disastrous consequences is to a large extent responsible for this unhappy decline in the steel industry as in other industries <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the state of the steel industry is one of the barometers of our economic condition as well as the raw material of our engineering industry including the motor car and shipbuilding industries <e> <s> is he aware that the steel industry has been cut to the bone already in this country and that it is an efficient industry now <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i think that the house would entirely agree with what the noble lord has just said but this is a statement of outstanding importance and i wonder whether the house might not think that one or two more questions might be justified in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords while totally rejecting that assertion may i put to the noble lord a question of fact <e> <s> can he confirm whether the cost of the reinstatement would be in the region of million whereas the revenue gained from bringing the benefit into the taxable income bracket would be in the order of million <e> <s> therefore would not the noble lord agree that if those figures are correct the failure of the government to review the per cent <e> <s> reduction is financially totally unjustifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> would he not agree that the european parliaments rejection of the supplement to the budget that is the repayment to the united kingdom was another disturbing development <e> <s>

lesson of history that the enemies of one era can become the friends of a later period <e>", "<cs> this is perhaps where i can be of some small assistance because it is well within my knowledge that

based possibly on age to enable those widows who wish to do so to visit the graves of their late husbands <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this has developed into a most grave problem which goes beyond the rowton houses and the question of alcoholics tramps or vagrants and <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is her majestys governments reaction to the initiative or

interesting speech and although i sympathise with many of the things he said he will not be surprised to know that i do not share his entire analysis of the situation <e> <s> the problems which the noble earl has touched upon are so complex and their implications are so great that one approaches them with restraint and indeed with humility <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i hope the noble lord would not say he could draw that inference form my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that she is satisfied with the state of industrial relations in the civil service at the present time and does she agree that the national facilities agreement will assist towards improving industrial relations in the civil service <e> <s> does she also agree that the amount of money spent is negligible and is well worth it in terms of achieving good industrial relations in the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the important practical point is

wonder whether the noble baroness would deal with the question that i asked about the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for initiating this debate on a subject of the highest importance <e> <s> i believe we have had a wide-ranging debate which albeit short has been one of considerable significance <e> <s> surely one of the saddest aspects of a world in which remarkable advances are constantly being made in science and technology is mans continuing inhumanity to his neighbour in so many parts of the globe <e> <s> man has gone to the moon and is exploring the mysteries of space yet he does not recognise that other men have basic rights to freedom justice and a peaceful existence <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with

kaunda and president nyerere <e> <s> i have a great admiration for them <e> <s> they are benevolent men they are good men and they are doing a remarkable job in difficult circumstances <e> <s> but

the magnitude which have been reported in the press and which the cabinet are said to have discussed this morning will impose serious changes of policy which will affect the national health service the education service and other aspects of the welfare state in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the contribution that these schemes make and welcoming them for that purpose would the noble earl agree that there is also a danger that they tend to mask long-term unemployment <e> <s> could he tell the house whether or not it is true that of the who are currently leaving school in

whether or not her majestys government are in favour of fluoridation of the water supplies of great britain <e> <s> does he not agree that the difficulty is that there is no national policy in relation to fluoridation and that the decision to fluoridate water supplies in areas of britain is made by nonelected bodies namely by nominated area health authorities <e> <s> the worry and anxiety

noble lord for repeating the answer <e> <s> while mr denktash has mentioned the possibility of a unilateral declaration of independence several times over the past few weeks the news that such a declaration has been made is both sad and unwelcome <e> <s> as the noble lord has stated this action is in breach of the treaty of guarantee which laid down that an act of partition by one of the

escalation of the conflict and that that could have far-reaching implications <e>", "<cs> my lords may i pursue the point about consultation a step further in view of its importance and in order that there may be no doubt about it <e> <s> is the noble baroness saying that her majestys government were consulted by the united states about the proposed bombing but that the government did not demur or object to this further escalation in the lebanon <e> <s> is that the position <e> <s> is it also the case that the different parties to the mnf can in fact go off on adventures of their own without

evil trade <e> <s> in the light of the questions that have been asked in the house this afternoon does he think there is a case for a full inquiry into all the implications of this trade and its growth and into the need to disseminate information about it throughout the country especially in the schools <e> <s> does he not believe that such an inquiry although we are aware that the minister and his colleagues have a great deal of information would be helpful at this stage before things get worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for repeating the long and complicated statement which the house will surely wish to debate as soon as possible <e> <s> while disagreements at eec summit meetings are not uncommon will not the noble viscount agree that this latest disagreement in athens is one of the worst setbacks ever known in the communitys history <e> <s> in addition to the admitted failure of the conference the statement which the noble viscount has just read makes it clear that the government have lost the agreement which was secured at stuttgart six months ago <e> <s> can we he told why the french government in particular changed their minds on this agreement in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in the final analysis the success of this conference will depend on the ultimate success of a summit meeting of the

go a step further and say why then are her majestys government considering the question of sovereignty <e> <s> what does she mean when she says that different officials have differing views <e> <s> is she saying that officials in the foreign and commonwealth office have differing views on the question of sovereignty <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that she makes this matter abundantly clear at this time <e> <s> otherwise there could be great difficulty <e> <s> if there are differing views is it the view of her majestys government now that the matter should go to the international court for arbitration <e> <s> would the government consider finding out from the new argentine government whether they are prepared to join in going to the international court to find out whether it is possible to achieve a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord belstead for what he has just said but this is a statement of the utmost importance <e> <s> it is one that affects virtually everyone in the country and no opportunity has yet arisen for a question to be asked about wales <e> <s> i most earnestly beseech the noble lord to relax on that point at least <e>", "<cs>

was good enough to inform the house that this matter is now under consideration by his department <e> <s> in the light of the supplementary questions which point to considerable concern can he say how long this process will take and when his department will report on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords while we clearly welcome any effort the government make to ease the problem of those who are out of work especially young school-leavers and others is it not the case that the argument between the political parties and indeed the argument within the conservative party itself is that the time has come for the government to stimulate the economy <e> <s> temporary expedients such as finding something for young people to do for months are no alternative to or substitute for a job which has prospects <e> <s> therefore will the noble earl apply his mind to the problem which has been put so clearly by mr edward heath sir ian gilmour mr francis pym and others of his right honourable friends

job <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is important not only that people should buy british but that we should all be able to say as we did before the war that british is best <e>

lord say whether her majestys government have it in mind to take the initiative in seeking to reconvene the start and inf talks in geneva which broke down recently <e> <s> while we welcome the words

lords by all means <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence that we have is contrary to that of the noble lord <e> <s> the national health service for all its weaknesses and our fear is that it will become

baroness think again <e> <s> is it not the case that we are shortly to open an embassy in nicaragua and is it not very much in our interests to give practical help <e> <s> pious hopes are one thing

this matter is reviewed by a new president and a new prime minister <e> <s> but have any of the reviews since changed the situation in any way <e> <s> is it not the case that the authority remains the same if it be an authority that the wording of still remains without change <e> <s> in that case will he not agree that that does not provide a right of veto <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful

service to the agricultural industry <e> <s> is the minister aware that i certainly have heard no criticism of the nsdo in any way and that this appears to me to be a further doctrinaire step by the government to consider privatisation for the sake of privatisation without any accompanying benefit to the farmers of this country at all <e> <s> will the noble lord say what is the nature of the inquiry which is going on at the present time <e> <s> what is the object of the inquiry <e> <s> how soon will it be before the government announce the result of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords while

botha during his visit <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that the continued detention of those unhappy people is in contravention of the geneva convention and of the ruling in by

farmers in wales <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that he and his right honourable friend are receiving a much larger volume of correspondence <e> <s> has the minister been able to calculate how many dairy

glad that the prime minister was able to raise most of the points which cause us acute concern in this country <e> <s> may we assume that during the part of the discussion which dealt with the internal affairs of south africa the prime minister stressed our unconditional opposition to apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that at the end of the day it was a labour government which saved the only wholly british motor car firm <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very real disquiet which exists about this case would the minister be good enough to think again and at least consult with his right honourable friend the home secretary about it <e> <s> is he aware that a discussion of the case during the committee stage of the bill is not really an alternative to a specific inquiry on the case itself <e> <s> is he aware that noble lords on all sides of the house as well as many people outside would feel much reassured if the government agreed to an inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether any concrete proposals for an initiative on the iran-iraq conflict resulted from the summit meeting <e> <s> secondly can she tell the house whether her majestys government are concerned about the safety of british tankers in the gulf <e> <s> what action is being taken in respect of british oil tankers at the present time <e> <s> also can the

international terrorism a plea to iran and iraq to stop attacking each other and so on <e> <s> these aims are unexceptionable <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears from the evidence contained in the questions put to the noble earl the minister who has answered very fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the quarterly report of the manpower services commission which was published over the last few days reveals some extremely disturbing figures <e> <s> in addition to the figure he has just quoted of over a million people out of work for over months is it not the case

what specific steps the government are proposing to take to help <e> <s> are they proposing now to invest in capital schemes so as to provide work in road building bridge building school building and hospital building which many economists say would not necessarily affect the governments policy with regard to inflation <e> <s> is it not high time that the government took some concrete steps to help these people especially the young school-leavers who are out of work <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the noble lord lord ezra but go one step further <e> <s> the noble lord understandably has confined himself to questions of law and order and condemnation of violence <e> <s> there is no question but that this side of the house condemns violence completely from whatever source it comes <e>

reconcile his replies with the governments promise in their last manifesto to reduce the poverty trap <e>", "<cs> my lords does the fact that her majestys government are to establish a mission in managua mean that the united kingdom is to play a more positive role in nicaragua <e> <s> will the noble baroness further confirm that her majestys government support the united states in every detail

to ensure that the elections in nicaragua in november are free and fair <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> once again it seems that little of major substance has been achieved by the meeting or by the series of bilateral talks held by the foreign secretary there has been little more than recognition of the fact that the need for a settlement is even more urgent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that in a recent debate the house was advised by two or three noble lords who are expert in this matter that the use of antibiotics in feeding stuffs needs to be looked at again <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord replied to that debate and said that this was a matter which he would consider <e> <s> could the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction as my noble friend lord glenamara said and that there is every justification for having another look at this <e> <s> furthermore does he not agree that the position of welsh university students is similar to that of the scottish university students and therefore that it is very unfair <e> <s> while i

economic council and similar bodies in england and wales <e> <s> these bodies considered very carefully the position of the communities and the industries concerned and possible future industries and then reported to ministers <e> <s> is there not a very strong case now for setting up an independent inquiry to consider a return to this system and also to consider other urgent matters connected

secretary visited moscow and that he had substantial talks with president chernenko and mr gromyko <e> <s> we must also regret the fact that so very few positive advances seem to have been made

foreign secretary made it plain that he was speaking for britain as an independent country and not merely as a go-between <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will forgive me for rising again but i must press the noble baroness on the substance of the points which she has elaborated <e> <s> what she has done is to repeat courteously and well what the statement itself says <e> <s> however she has not responded to the point which i made and which was reinforced by the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> this was as to whether or not there was any positive response at any stage to any of the very important points which the right honourable gentleman put to mr chernenko and mr gromyko <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house but may i press the noble baroness still further on this <e> <s> is it really the case that there was no response to the matters which were put by the foreign secretary to the russians <e> <s> is that really the position or is the noble baroness being diplomatically discreet about it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble viscount for making the statement especially in view of the accumulating press reports about the position <e> <s> we are gratified that the result of the division on th june has caused the government to a significant extent to accept the views of the house in this matter <e> <s> we are nevertheless disappointed that elections are not to be held and we shall clearly have to reserve our position until we have had an opportunity to consider the amendments in detail after they have been tabled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the house fully understands that he has to defend the department against the committees charges <e> <s> but is he also aware that in the report it was stated that the united states government recognised that it would have been better if they had consulted the british government much earlier <e> <s> can he therefore say what steps have been taken to improve the consultative procedures between the two countries so as to avoid that sort of thing in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one further point to the noble lord which concerns intelligence sources in the caribbean <e> <s> as he recalls there has been considerable criticism of the way in which we have neglected to develop or to continue the intelligence contacts that we had in that area since most of the territories gained their independence <e> <s> can he say whether we have improved our intelligence contacts in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise again but may i ask whether it is not the case that this is an area where we have particular interests and where we still maintain close relationships <e> <s> in those circumstances is it not a retrograde step to neglect our intelligence contacts <e>", "<cs> my lords the consultative paper on this subject was i understand published in july exactly three years ago <e> <s> can the noble lord say when a definitive statement is to be made by his department on the question of tagging and on the nets in view of the time that has passed since the report was published <e> <s> secondly can he tell the house what would be the effect on fishing enterprises of banning these nets <e> <s> i understand that there are complications here and i should be grateful if he would enlighten us upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> as the house will appreciate it raises extremely grave issues <e> <s> the high court ruling shows again how important it is that the government should not ride roughshod over those who are affected by their policies <e> <s> the necessity to consult is vital and in this case the judge has ruled that the government had ignored the rules of natural justice and that ministers exercising the royal prerogative through orders in council should he subject to the same scrutiny and control by the courts as if statute law were involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how helpful the bandying of figures is <e> <s> in connection with the question asked by the noble lord lord sandys is it not the case

my lords in all the long catalogue of statements made in this house over the last months or so this is the most deeply disquieting that i have listened to <e> <s> i regret to say this to the noble lord who i respect though he has no direct real responsibility for it <e> <s> is he aware first that the disparity between the figure of million given by my noble friend lord underhill and the million mentioned in the statement needs far more explanation than he has been able to give us today in the house <e> <s> is he aware that the sealinks united kingdom ports with which i am most familiar are clearly the welsh ports of holyhead and fishguard <e> <s> if the assets include the harbours it seems inconceivable to me that the ports of holyhead and fishguard should not themselves be worth more than million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply but may i follow up one point <e> <s> is it the case therefore that before this transaction can be completed and before the new owner-designate can run sealink ports and ships further legislation will be required in order to meet the obligations under existing legislation affecting sealink ports <e> <s> if that is the position when will such a bill be introduced <e>", "<cs> because therefore they could be sold in one block is the noble lord saying that there is no need for legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we warmly welcome the publication of the proposals to extend democratic procedures in hong kong although we wish that they might have gone a little further <e> <s> can she inform the house how the green paper in which the proposals are contained is now going to be processed <e> <s> secondly can she tell the house what is the purpose of the foreign and commonwealth secretarys visit to hong kong next week <e> <s> is it related to the proposals for an increase of democracy there <e> <s> will he be seeing the council or other representative bodies <e> <s> could she enlighten the house on the purposes of his visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness <e> <s> am i mistaken in thinking that the foreign secretary is going to hong kong as well as to peking to see the chinese foreign minister <e> <s> my question was directed to the possibility of a hong kong visit and to ask what the purposes of that might be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that we on this side of the house desire nothing more than a fair and equitable resolution of this unhappy and disturbing dispute <e> <s> does he not believe that given the amount of violence which exists in the country not only in this sphere but in others as well it is at this time very much in the public interest that the government themselves should take an initiative <e> <s> is he aware that if such an initiative were now taken it would be greatly appreciated by all the people of this country and it would certainly be preferable to what is by way of developing into an obstinate refusal to do anything at all to seek a resolution <e> <s> if the noble earl is not able today to comment on the proposal of my noble friend that the matter should be referred to an independent public inquiry of some kind would he be good enough to discuss it with his right honourable friend who would in turn discuss it with the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> we support the governments readiness to join in these talks and we deeply regret the breakdown <e> <s> we hope that this is merely temporary as it is very much in the interests of argentina and ourselves that we should return to normal relations as soon as possible and we hope that further efforts will be made to resume negotiations <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness can tell us if there is any expectation that talks will be resumed with the argentine representatives <e> <s> while i accept that the argentine representatives went back on the agreed mechanism for dealing with sovereignty is it not the case that the formula was a fragile one from the start <e> <s> a formula which enables the argentine government to raise the subject of sovereignty and then allows the british representatives to say that they would not discuss it with an expectation that the argentines would be prepared to drop it and discuss other matters on the face of it seems very facile although i do not doubt that that was the agreed basis <e> <s> but it seems to have been a very shaky basis from the start <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is regrettable that it was not possible to discuss the crucial practical matters to which the noble baroness referred including i think the cessation of hostilities and also the exclusion zone

court of justice at the hague as one possibility that should be considered over a period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness and i do not dispute what she said <e> <s> the more confident we are the more ready we should be to go to the international court of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say on behalf of my noble friends that we accept the conclusions of the report in the same terms as the noble viscount has just indicated <e> <s> we endorse the tribute which he paid to noble lords on the committee for the very careful and patient thought that they gave to this difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house for explaining the background to this order <e> <s> the noble viscount referred to the characteristics of the office of lord chancellor which distinguishes the lord chancellor from other ministers <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord would agree that his tenure of his office is nothing if not distinctive <e> <s> of course we recognise that we are dealing with a unique office which combines the headship of the judiciary and a very senior position in the cabinet

that the time is not too far distant when my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones may inherit a largess which was previously denied to him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this movement by the government gives no guarantee of greater success and certainly no guarantee of greater accountability <e> <s> will he make plain to the house and indeed to the country that it is the governments plan to move away from the policy of a mixed economy which has served this country very well over the past years to an extreme policy of private enterprise which will cause considerable suffering and uncertainty to the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords two years ago the noble earl acknowledged that there was a shortfall in the recruitment of administrative trainees and this was underlined i think by the civil service commissioners at the time <e> <s> is he satisfied that there will be adequate recruitment this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for

careful assessment be made of the effect of the new proposal on the british fishing industry <e> <s> will the noble lord give us a very clear undertaking that that will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while we appreciate the difficulties caused to our consulate in durban the principles involved far outweigh any of the difficulties caused <e> <s> is he aware that we welcomed his initial statement that her majestys government are not proposing to evict the three from the consulate <e> <s> nevertheless is he further aware they are making it extremely difficult for the three to stay there <e> <s> would he not agree further that the detention without trial which awaits these three if they are caused to leave the consulate is odious in the extreme to every member of this parliament <e> <s> would he agree that it is something about which protests should be made directly to the south african government and through the united nations if necessary <e> <s> finally i notice that in the newspapers this morning the south african ambassador visited the foreign and commonwealth office yesterday <e> <s> can the noble lord indicate to the house what was said to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he said about the efforts of certain members of the labour party in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the noble earl because he is sliding past the main point i put to him <e> <s> would he not agree that in view of the fact that the disagreement between the parties is now a relatively small one and that there is a willingness on the part of the national union of mineworkers to achieve a settlement the government should take this step now to bring the parties together <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will be good enough to tell us what progress has been made in the review of the vienna convention about which there was a great deal of discussion some weeks ago <e> <s> secondly is it the case that his right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary has sent a letter to the heads of missions in london about this matter and is it the case that he has told them that the rules under the vienna convention will be applied more rigorously in future <e> <s> can the noble lord say what is the reaction to that of the heads of missions or indeed their governments <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend and the noble lord have said this is a tragedy on a vast scale where at least half a million people are facing starvation <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that one of the difficulties is that the emergency reserves under the world food programme are down to virtually nil <e> <s> what steps are her majestys government taking to assist in increasing them with for example our partners in western europe <e> <s> is he aware so far as our own surpluses in western europe are concerned that whereas what he said about powdered milk is probably very true in most parts of the third world they could use flour <e> <s> it would resolve the situation if the western world could use their surpluses of flour to send to these countries which are now in such dire need and that is something which her majestys government should consider as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not deal with the question of the world food programme <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to clarify one important part of the statement which says that the board not only remains committed to the operation of the colliery review procedure but is prepared to enhance that procedure <e> <s> would the noble earl say exactly what that means <e> <s> is it the case that both the ncb and the num were prepared to accept the independent recommendation of a body set up to conduct that procedure <e> <s> will he confirm indeed that the government have in mind to set up a body that would be independent and that would look at any recommendations for pit closures <e> <s> is the ncb in particular prepared to accept the recommendation of an independent body to that effect <e> <s> secondly will the noble earl answer the question put by the noble lord lord ezra about the possibility of the governments convening the tripartite committee which seems to me a very sensible proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the government are discussing this matter with the united states administration at the present time <e> <s> in view of the admittedly serious implication of the initiative if it is carried out can he give an indication as to whether any estimate has been made of its cost and what long-term effect that might have on americas commitment to nato <e> <s> finally what effect would it have on the future of the antiballistic missile treaty of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement and i am of course very pleased that the negotiations on the entry of spain and portugal into the european community appear now to be making some progress after the protracted meetings held during the summer <e> <s> earlier this month we learnt about the agreement with portugal regarding the level of permissible imported sugar cane and todays press reports tell us that the community are virtually prepared to receive portugal <e>", "<cs> my lords although the appalling problem of starvation in ethiopia and elsewhere was no part of the discussions in the council none the less we are grateful to the noble lord for the information that he has been able to let us have today <e> <s> i believe that i speak on behalf of the whole house when i say that in view of the information which has come forward following the exchange on this subject which we had in the house on friday of last week we would expect her majestys government to take action with our partners in the community or if necessary alone up to the point of chartering ships to take grain to ethiopia just as we chartered ships to go to the falklands <e> <s> would the noble lord be good enough to press this point on his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of course he will be aware that an international conference is to be held in i think khartoum on th november to consider this whole matter of the gulf and the red sea <e> <s> can he indicate whether or not her majestys government are taking an interest in that conference and whether we shall be sending either a representative or an observer there <e>", "<cs> my lords may we also add our congratulations to the noble lord on this anniversary <e> <s> the noble lord has made a significant contribution to our public affairs over a very long period <e> <s> he has always been a stimulating and effective debater in both chambers and we hope that he will continue to attend this house for many years in order to enliven our proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the british officer among these generals is an officer with a distinguished record whatever may be his views about strategy or armaments <e> <s> would it not be quite wrong to give the impression in this house that we all regard him as a mole a red under the bed or a communist stooge <e> <s> is he not entitled to his views on these matters without being so branded <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right to say that this officer is as entitled to express his view as everyone else in this country <e> <s> is he also not entitled to be excluded from being described as a communist a traitor a red under the bed or any other unpleasant name which people direct at him <e> <s> will the noble baroness be quite clear in what she says about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness mentioned brigadier harbottle but was it not quite clear from the implication of what was said by her and others that he was so regarded <e> <s> would she not agree that he is a distinguished ex-officer with a good record <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the rapid action taken by the government over the last few days and the action taken by the voluntary organisations <e> <s> may i warmly support the proposals put by the noble lord <e> <s> lord maude and my noble friend lord john-mackie and press the government to take some initiative in regard to longer-term action <e> <s> would the minister not agree that the agencies do exist through the united nations and in other forms <e> <s> the problem for political and other reasons is to get the governments of africa of the countries which are affected by this constant annual drought lasting over a very long period to co-operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this debate be adjourned until tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble baroness lady young in saying that we on this side are also looking forward to hearing the two maiden speakers today <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble baroness for her wide-ranging speech which touched upon the main foreign policy issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble lord that governments which he supported and of which he was a member at one stage and previous labour governments as well were prepared to talk in reasonable terms with the argentine over a period of or more years with compromise in mind <e> <s> if a settlement is to be achieved in future both sides must be prepared to make some compromise <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that as inevitable sooner or later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for the question but i feel that he and the house would agree that it is not a question for me but is one for the noble baroness who met mr denktash and the noble lords who are in possession of all the facts <e> <s> i am sure that they will take what he says into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the visit of the foreign secretary to the middle east and note that he has offered to consider playing a part in an expanded united nations force in south lebanon but that and i quote the right honourable gentlemans words <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is the total population of communities under and the total population of communities under <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us the figures for england and wales respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord briefly confirm that he is saying that the british producer is on exactly the same footing as his french counterpart in so far as the export of grain and beef is concerned <e> <s> is he aware that there is considerable concern at the present time about the export of beef and what is regarded as unfair competition from the french producer <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the merits of the case would the noble lord agree that personal attacks of this kind are totally contrary to the traditions of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that we welcome and support the experiment that he has just announced and further support the proposition that at the end of an experimental period of say three months the matter should then be considered by the appropriate committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill which we fully support gives the house the opportunity to send our good wishes to both these countries which have such close connections with our own <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble baroness for explaining the detail of the bill to us <e> <s> i am glad to have this opportunity to welcome my noble friend lord tonypandy back to the house after his illness and to see him looking so well <e> <s> he has a very close connection with brunei and indeed has had the honour of dato conferred upon him by the sultan <e> <s> i know that he would wish to speak in this debate if as he said his voice had fully recovered <e> <s> he hopes to be able to speak in our debates soon but with us he sends his best wishes to brunei <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for his comprehensive speech especially as he has only recently returned from nicaragua and speaks therefore with valuable recent experience <e> <s> what is the nature of the problem in nicaragua and why should we here in britain and the house of lords be concerned with events over miles away from our shores <e> <s> the short answer is that we are always sensitive to the actions of the so-called super-powers because they can affect us quickly and in some cases harmfully <e> <s> furthermore we are naturally interested as friends and allies of the united states in its foreign policies as it of course is interested in ours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was that we were rather more relaxed about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in the queens speech there was a firm <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating that statement <e> <s> i join with her in total condemnation of this cruel murder and in expressing our very deep sympathy to mrs norris and her family <e> <s> his death is a great loss to the diplomatic service and to our country for mr percy norris was an experienced and most able diplomat <e> <s> the lack of information calls for brevity but i hope the noble baroness will be able to give us an assurance that in addition to the action taken by the indian government itself today steps are being taken to examine the security arrangements in all overseas missions so as to minimise the dangers which are obviously greater today than they have been at any point in modern times <e> <s> finally can the noble baroness give us an assurance that in any reductions in the fco budgets expenditure on security arrangements will be excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble baroness for her assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the statement and we warmly welcome the decision to re-open the frontier and to restore communications including air communications which are of considerable importance to us <e> <s> we note that this concession is being made in return for britains willingness to discuss sovereignty and that sovereignty is to be on the agenda although the statement also says that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords have referred to different parts of the country <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i visited south wales over the weekend and found considerable apprehension there about the effect of this white paper or at least about what the newspapers had prophesied would be in the white paper and they were pretty near the mark <e> <s> can the noble lord say what the effect will be in wales <e> <s> he told the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe briefly what the effect would be in scotland <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that apart from northern ireland unemployment in wales is higher than it is in any other part of the united kingdom <e> <s> with unemployment at that level in wales in scotland on merseyside in the north and in other parts of this country how can the government possibly justify reducing the amount to be spent on regional aid by million at this time <e> <s> that is the question which the country will be asking <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been good enough to deal with those two questions very fully <e> <s> we are grateful to him <e> <s> the noble lord has of course been appointed in an effort to deal with the appalling unemployment problem that is a source of so great a worry to all of us <e> <s> is he aware that this matter was dealt with when we heard the statement repeated yesterday about the governments new regional aid policy <e> <s> it is very difficult to think of questions to put to the noble lord in view of the paucity of this statement <e> <s> however is he aware that the words <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the resumption of normal relations which is shortly to take place can the noble baroness say whether the government have made any assessment of the disadvantages which will accompany the resumption of relations <e> <s> for example what is the calculation of the number of spaniards who could then come over to find work given that unemployment is very much higher on the spanish side than it is on the gibraltar side <e> <s> also what will be the results of the commercialisation of the dockyard <e> <s> is it not the case that all these factors will create special problems for gibraltar <e> <s> is it not important therefore to give added incentives to those who are seeking to encourage the tourist trade <e> <s> is it not the case that the amount of money which the noble baroness has mentioned million is totally inadequate to meet the needs that will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was unable to reply clearly to the authoritative supplementary questions put to him by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> therefore as a result the house is in some confusion <e> <s> would he be good enough to write to the noble and learned lord and see that a copy of the letter is placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the question the noble earl said that he suspected it was due to economies by the government <e> <s> he said that he suspected that is to say he was not sure about it <e> <s> therefore would he be good enough to write to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord buxton of alsa for initiating this debate on the subject of the island of st helena <e> <s> in the interests of brevity i do not propose to follow him my noble friend lord shackleton and other noble lords into the security implications of the falklands and the south atlantic important though they may be <e> <s> my own feeling is that at some stage the house should debate that issue separately <e> <s> the antarctic treaty and the implications and accessibility to the antarctic with all that it means during the years to come is so important that it merits a debate in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely making a comparison between the aid which now goes to the falklands and to st helena <e> <s> it is perfectly true as my noble friend has said that there was no grant aid to the falklands for reasons of which we are aware namely they were able to manage without it <e> <s> but that was not true and has not been true for many years of st helena <e> <s> what i have tried to do is to make a factual comparison between the grant aid that is now going to the falklands and to st helena <e> <s> i think that in doing that i was pursuing a proper argument <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness would give way on the point of the criterion which she mentioned can she tell the house of any other population in any other british territory which has a closer connection with this country than st helena <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> we are very pleased that the negotiations at the dublin summit reached agreement on so many fronts <e> <s> we note that the appointment of all new members of <e>", "<cs> my lords although we must be relieved that this fishing armada will not be sunk will the noble viscount take account of the fact that a fleet of trawlers is really enormous <e> <s> with respect to the noble viscount it is not a matter of detail <e> <s> if as the statement says there has been a satisfactory settlement of the fishing issue it is right to ask the noble viscount whether the number of trawlers in the spanish fleet has been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords while the ministry of defence is not a national health service is the noble lord not aware that the closure of docks and ordnance factories in areas of high unemployment is an extremely serious matter especially as this government never make any preparation for it or provide any alternative employment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we warmly welcome the extension of the less favoured areas which as he is aware has been under consideration for at least years <e> <s> can he say how many farmers will be advantaged by this in england scotland and wales respectively <e> <s> how much additional money can they expect to receive per acre as a result of this new arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for her informative opening speech and we also look forward in this debate to hearing the noble earl lord birkenhead for the first time <e> <s> britain has problems of a greater or lesser degree of difficulty with most of the remaining imperial inheritance <e> <s> hong kong presented a special one could i think say unique problem and one that was clearly not foreseen in the treaties and conventions of and <e> <s> as the noble baroness has just said in the first two per cent <e> <s> of what is now known as hong kong was ceded in perpetuity and in the convention of the remaining per cent <e> <s> was leased for years <e> <s> as in so many other cases those who signed the convention saw years as eternity whereas in fact they left the present inheritors of the lease with a hard nut to crack <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> this is a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness passes on to another subject i wonder whether she would deal with this matter <e> <s> first may i on behalf of noble lords thank her for the thorough way in which she is responding to the debate <e> <s> on the point of further debates on hong kong either on a white paper or in another way she will know that there are a number of questions <e> <s> however thorough and zealous she has been in answering there are a number of points which remain unanswered and as the years proceed a number of matters will arise on which parliament and this house will need answers <e> <s> will she give an undertaking that even if set debates are not possible there will be in government time opportunities for the government to report on the way matters are developing in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the agreement in dublin was not an agreement with spain or about spain but rather an agreement among member states about their common position that fishing stocks and the traditional rights of member states should be protected <e> <s> there was no agreement in dublin to deal with the fact that spain has trawlers <e> <s> if those trawlers were let loose in the traditional fishing grounds of this country and of other countries then the british fishing industry would be at an end <e> <s> can the minister indicate clearly to the house that the attitude of her majestys government will be one of defending that british fishing industry or at least what remains of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has tried valiantly to reassure the house about this matter but will he be good enough to explain what restructuring a fleet of fishing vessels means <e> <s> does it mean reducing that number of vessels substantially <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the government have offered iraq credit to the amount of million <e> <s> if so what is it intended that that credit should be used for <e> <s> furthermore is it the case that in october iraq was offered million credit by her majestys government <e> <s> can the noble baroness say whether that was taken up and what it was used for <e> <s> furthermore on the question of the united nations can she say whether her majestys government have any intention to take an initiative themselves and raise the matter in the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has not as she normally would answered my question specifically <e> <s> i mentioned a figure of million in october last year and million now making a total of million <e> <s> surely her majestys government would not give credit to that extent without knowing precisely what the money will be used for in the context of the conflict that is now going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will agree that we have had an interesting timely and important debate and this includes the enthusiasm of the last few moments <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> all the speeches and i heard them all were of interest especially considering the restriction on time <e> <s> there are only two brief points i should like to make <e> <s> first i was chided by one or two noble lords for making what they called a party-political speech <e> <s> it was a political speech i concede <e> <s> it is part of our work to make political speeches and i would be guilty of a grave dereliction of duty if i did not criticise the government on so serious an issue as the present unemployment situation <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble earl reconcile what he has just said with the deep concern which has been expressed by every sector of the construction industry and by the confederation of british industry in their conference last month <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the national water council which is the responsible authority in this matter is in fact far from satisfied with the governments efforts in this area <e> <s> is he aware that the report to which he referred made plain that there are sewer failures a year and collapses with repair costs of million a year that a significant percentage of the countrys kilometres of sewers are over a hundred years old and that the council recommends that the government should show a sense of urgency in the matter <e> <s> will the noble lord say what percentage increase of investment the government will be making in order to avoid a very serious development indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that kilometres of sewers are over years old <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government get away from this septic tank philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby for raising a subject which i know is of considerable interest to us all <e> <s> i know that my noble friend has for some considerable time been concerned about the role of this house and the way in which the government and the other place react to it <e> <s> i suspect that it was the few remarks of the noble viscount in his speech in the debate on the address which stimulated my noble friend to raise the matter today <e> <s> i have looked again at the noble viscounts words on th november at col <e> <s> they read as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i warmly endorse the well-deserved tribute which the noble viscount has paid to sir david house <e> <s> it is a tradition of this place that the office of black rod should be filled by a senior officer of the armed services <e> <s> it speaks highly of them that time after time they produce for the service of parliament men of the calibre and with the distinguished military record of sir david house <e>", "<cs> my lords given the sharp decline in the value of the pound over the last few weeks and specifically over the last days why did it take the government so long to take this so-called firm action <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether she has any information about the latest intentions of the israeli government to withdraw israeli troops to the litani river <e> <s> are her majestys government in favour of this move <e> <s> will she recall the visit of her right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary to the middle east in october when he said that he would personally do all he could to advance the cause of peace in the area <e> <s> that is something which we warmly support <e> <s> is she able to say whether any initiatives have been taken by him since then <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness any information about the latest intentions of the israeli government to withdraw unilaterally to the litani river in the light of the breakdown of the recent talks <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a debate of great interest and importance and we are indebted to my noble friend lord jenkins for initiating it <e> <s> in his speech my noble friend drew attention to one aspect as he sees it of our relationship with the united states of america namely the relations between the two governments in the field of defence <e> <s> i propose to go somewhat wider than that and many of the excellent speeches we have heard have also ranged more widely <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that the argentine now has a democratic government under a moderate and benign leadership <e> <s> is not this a time therefore to seek an agreed agenda which could form the basis of a further meeting between ourselves and the government of the argentine <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be quite wrong and irresponsible to let this matter drift on inconclusively given the cost of the present exercise <e> <s> also could she say whether there is any truth in the report that the government are thinking of drafting a constituton for the falklands <e> <s> if that is so what is the nature of the exercise and how is this to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be the purpose of such a constitution to entrench the principle of sovereignty <e> <s> if that is the case it really will make a settlement quite impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant task to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham on his first speech in this house and to say that he lived up to his reputation of being interesting and stimulating and of course eloquent as well <e> <s> he has raised matters of great importance and by so doing he has enhanced our debate <e> <s> we all look forward to hearing the right reverend prelate many times in the future <e>", "<cs> the quotation is clear <e> <s> that is the view expressed by an authoritative body and i think the government ought to take account of it <e> <s> we believe that that is the choice that the government have to make either tax cuts or investment in the infrastructure <e> <s> the study on the infrastructure which was handed to the chancellor on th january says and after all the nedc was set up to advise the government that there is a huge backlog of maintenance and renewal to be done on roads on bridges on water mains on sewers on housing and so on and make no mistake about it these are absolutely vital to the future prosperity of britain there is no argument about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i made it quite plain that the international recession was a contributory factor <e> <s> i did not blame it all on the government <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it perfectly clear and i hope that the noble lord will do me the courtesy of reading <e>", "<cs> my lords given the importance of this development can the noble lord obtain some rather more accurate statistics than those he now has <e> <s> in his reply to the noble baroness he said that there were some individual schemes <e> <s> is it not important that his department should be fully apprised of the details of these schemes so as to enable him to give more accurate answers to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that these are operational matters for the chief officers concerned but with great respect they are matters of great interest to the country as a whole and certainly should be of concern to his department <e> <s> i ask him seriously on behalf of the house whether he will consult his right honourable and learned friend in order to obtain more accurate information about these schemes not only in london but also in the country at large <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords this is admittedly a difficult area but can the noble lord say whether american servicemen defending non-nuclear equipment are in any way permitted to shoot at people they believe to be interfering with that equipment <e> <s> i ask the question because this has appeared in several newspapers and i think it requires clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any distinction between what a british serviceman is entitled to do and what an american serviceman is entitled to do in the same situation that is defending non-nuclear equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the figures as he has said are not only gloomy but extremely serious <e> <s> while the average figures are very serious the figures in some parts of the country wales the north-east scotland are very bad indeed <e> <s> the government are creating an intractable problem <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that while we respect him very much we understand he was appointed to his present office to find solutions and that at the present time according to reports he is working on a plan to seek to resolve this very serious problem <e> <s> can he tell us whether that is true what his plan is or whether he can announce when it is likely to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i asked the noble lord to indicate precisely what he is working on <e> <s> he referred to the work he is doing now <e> <s> can he tell the house in view of the gravity of the situation

progress being made in the mbfr talks at vienna and also in the important talks being held in stockholm <e> <s> perhaps i may refer the noble baroness to an authoritative report in i think last fridays edition of the <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to speak not as leader of the opposition but as a nonconformist and to say to the noble earl that there would be grave resentment and disquiet throughout this country england scotland wales and northern ireland if the government even began to contemplate value added tax on the bible <e>", "<cs> my lords while we hope for a successful conclusion to the israeli withdrawal is it not possible that violence of the type described by my noble friend lord shinwell may occur in south lebanon <e> <s> in these circumstances what action are her majestys government taking within the united nations to secure a peacekeeping force and would her majestys government be prepared to contribute to such a force <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the statement and we also welcome the accord and the agreement which has apparently been achieved between britain spain and gibraltar <e> <s> we note especially the reference to the remarks of the chief minister of gibraltar sir joshua hassan which are extremely important namely that the meeting was a positive and constructive one in every way

tell us what is the present attitude of her majestys government to the question of linkage <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the formula on sovereignty described by the foreign and commonwealth secretary in his statement yesterday about gibraltar and the way that that is to be dealt with be used to start new talks with the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that water is an inflammatory subject in wales <e> <s> he may well have added to the flames <e> <s> will he clarify the position in relation to the principality that it has always been understood that the welsh water authority has a special relationship with the welsh office that is to say with the noble lords right honourable friend <e> <s> notwithstanding what he has said about the principle of nationalisation in relation to water undertakings generally will the noble lord confirm that the relationship between the secretary of state for wales and the welsh water board remains a special one <e>", "<cs> my

eastern seaboard of canada should be strengthened he does so with great authority <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that there is a considerable potential as mr desmond watkins the shell manager in canada said in his article for british manufacturers at a time when british manufacturers could very well do with jobs in view of the high unemployment in this country <e> <s> i realise that the

will it be published so as to be available to this house and another place and will debates be possible thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to say what are the terms of

dismay not only to the farming community to the agricultural colleges and to the university departments where they teach agriculture but also in the afrc itself <e> <s> will he also confirm that this

crisis which threatens to upset the balance of international politics was not dealt with convincingly <e> <s> how does the noble viscount reconcile the presidents remarks mentioned in the statement

elwyn-jones who sends apologies to the house for his absence <e> <s> he has a very good excuse he is sitting judicially <e> <s> i am deeply disappointed by the response of the noble lord despite the fact that he quoted theophilus evans <e> <s> if theophilus evans were here in your lordships house he would make a far more effective speech than i can make in reply to the noble lord because as the

into this matter in any detail may i say this to the noble lord <e> <s> when i was at school when my noble friend was at school and when my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones was at school in carmarthenshire at that stage there was very little welsh taught in the schools <e> <s> today welsh is taught in the schools far more extensively than it was in those days <e> <s> therefore among the welsh-speaking population there is a far better grasp of grammatic welsh today than there was even in those times <e> <s> welsh-speaking people are perfectly capable of giving evidence in the courts of wales or is the noble lord saying that they are english courts in wales <e> <s> the fact is that they are anglo-welsh courts and that a welshman has as much rights in the courts in wales as an englishman has in the courts of england <e> <s> that is the reality of the situation as i see it <e> <s> if it is different i should be grateful if the noble lord will let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> that gives me some comfort because the act which he supports is the act which i had the privilege of piloting through parliament <e> <s> nevertheless let me make one or two points in extension of what my noble friend lord prys-davies has said on the facts <e> <s> in north wales for example there is cause for concern at the present time because of the or so prosecuting officers appointed by the newly-formed police prosecuting department only three are welsh-speaking whereas up to now in gwynedd almost every solicitor and in clwyd a fair number of the solicitors briefed to prosecute for the police were fluent welsh speakers <e> <s> so there at the very start there is a retrograde step <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what we are here for <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord read the united nations report on the appalling treatment of prisoners of war on both sides <e> <s> can he say what action her majestys government propose to take about that

credit of allegedly million given by the government to that country <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement and we join with him in offering our profound sympathy to the families and friends of the nine men and women killed last thursday by the attack on newry police station as well as the relatives of the others who have been killed over the last two or three weeks <e> <s> words are inadequate to convey our horror and revulsion at this wicked deed which is reported as being one of the worst attacks since the beginning of the present troubles in northern ireland years ago <e> <s> sadly it reflects a worsening of the violence in the province during the last days <e> <s> last year it seemed that the violence was abating and it is disappointing to find that this is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that commercial interests as represented by the cbi and the institute of directors are deeply concerned about these cuts because of their effect upon the promotion of the sale of british goods overseas <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that our competitors for example france and the united states of america have increased their overseas broadcasting substantially <e> <s> for example france has increased its external broadcasting budget by million and america by billion <e> <s> in these circumstances would it not be correct to say as the cbi and others have done that these cuts are the grossest folly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would be good enough to tell the house how the government reach a judgment on these directives as to what is best for the consumer in this country <e> <s> for example do the government consult the county councils who have officials who deal with these matters and whose members are also concerned with the interests of consumers throughout britain <e> <s> can he tell the house precisely how the government come to a conclusion on whether the directives are good or bad for the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the supplementary question asked by the noble and gallant lord lord carver perfectly realistic in all the circumstances <e> <s> given that we are on the threshold of very important talks would it not be best to allow them to proceed hoping that they will be successful and that we may participate in due course rather than have this rather useless exchange at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what will be the estimated full cost of running these committees once they have taken over all their new functions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the case he has sought to make and the statement itself give the house no confidence that the government are doing a prudent thing in

consultations the government had before they came to this serious conclusion <e> <s> in a whole catalogue of divisive legislation this has been the most divisive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely disgraceful that the distinguished chairman should be called in and presented with a <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has just made a very important statement <e> <s> it is clear that she has given very careful thought to the representations about statelessness which were made in the house in the second reading debate on th february when the noble lord lord geddes the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham and i and i think one or two others dealt at length specifically with this point <e> <s> what is more important is that this afternoon the noble baroness has made what i believe to be a substantial concession on a matter which we in this committee and the interested parties in hong kong itself have brought to the attention of government over the past few months <e> <s> the assurance of citizenship for the grandchildren of those who are british nationals overseas born after i understand that is the concession is indeed a very welcome step <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble baroness and her right honourable and learned friend for the undertaking to extend to a further generation the right of citizenship <e> <s> i am sure it will further improve the climate of confidence in hong kong <e>", "<cs> i was not surprised to read this amendment because the noble lord lord gridley has been a loyal advocate of this small group of public servants from the start <e>

would and as he could on privy council terms that if the foreign office so decides he will not impart any of the information he obtains <e>", "<cs> my lords in his initial reply the noble earl said that per cent <e> <s> of the graduates in the period in question are out of work <e> <s> is not this really a most serious state of affairs <e> <s> will he be good enough to say what this represents in numerical terms <e> <s> how many are science graduates how many are arts graduates <e> <s> can he say specifically what steps are being taken by the department of education and science to place

library so that we can have an explanation of the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to say what is holding up the second replenishment and when do the government hope to be able to make an announcement about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord assist the house by telling us about the present functions of the governments civil defence adviser <e> <s> what

first question <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord go a little further and tell the house what was the womens institutes reaction to the governments policy on rural buses <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the reply to the private notice question asked in another place <e> <s> we endorse and support the strong reaction of the foreign and commonwealth

conclusion at the talks which are to take place in brussels in a few days time <e> <s> we also welcome the advances which have been made in the recent negotiations and which will allow the drafting of a budget and the implementation of community programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that what corby demonstrates even more than the two examples he gave is that where the government intervene practically and constructively with the injection of capital then unemployment can be tackled <e> <s> when is the example of corby to be followed in other areas of high unemployment and acute difficulty in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord the government chief whip for that undertaking that there will be discussions <e> <s> but i think it is worth underlining the main point which my noble friend made namely that with a very large and complex bill as this is it is desirable that an opportunity is given to the opposition to consider very carefully all the implications which are involved <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord is fully aware of this as indeed will be the leader of the house the opposition is always at a disadvantage

appreciates the way in which the government have been prepared to consider the amendments proposed in both houses and also to make considerable concessions in the course of the passage of the bill thus far <e> <s> this co-operative attitude of the government in responding to the suggestions of honourable members in another place and of noble lords in this house has in fact improved the bill and

exchanges in the house and the disquiet demonstrated in all parts of it will she be good enough to look at the matter again and talk to her right honourable friend <e> <s> it seems quite clear from

others while he was in this country will the noble baroness not agree that the visit of mr gorbachev to this country to which she referred would be of assistance in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords before we proceed further in view of the enormous importance of the local government bill and the implications of the very long list of speakers namely i wonder whether the noble viscount the leader of the house has given consideration to the matter of whether the time available for the debate ought to be extended so that we have two days and not one for the second reading of the bill <e> <s> in

shall be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord had a very good say now he must take it as well as give it <e>", "<cs> my lords although we are extremely glad to hear the information given by the minister of the increased number of people at work perhaps he can clarify one point <e> <s> is it not the case that out of the total number of additional jobs he gave <e> <s> over are part-time jobs

poverty the rebuilding and the old infrastructure <e> <s> are not those the matters which should be considered by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree with the general recommendations of the procedure committee and with the remarks of the noble lord the chairman of committees <e> <s> we recognise that difficulties can arise primarily because some questions are of more importance than others <e> <s> where a question is of current public interest clearly the house has a duty to deal with it fully <e> <s> those of us who ask questions have a responsibility but so do the ministers who

leader of the house not agree that my noble friend lord jenkins of putney had a perfect right to put the question that he did without interference criticism or political bias from any other noble lord in this house <e> <s> that is one of the traditional functions of this house and it is one of the privileges of being a member of this house <e> <s> does the noble baroness not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept from me that there is acute concern in wales about the future of the welsh plant breeding station which has made an outstanding contribution to agriculture in wales and indeed abroad in the third world as well <e> <s> if this plant breeding station is working so well and bearing in mind its contribution why are the government interfering with it at the present time <e> <s> why are they interfering with the two institutes to which my noble friend has referred if they are as successful as we know them to be <e> <s> will the noble lord give the house an assurance that there will be no reduction in the status of the welsh plant breeding station and that the government will not make it an out-station but that it will enjoy the same status as hurley near reading <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is regarded as deplorable that ministers of the crown should react instantaneously to reports of this kind for example a report of the select committee of this house and the report from the church of england that has recently been published without reading them in the first place <e> <s> is he aware that we welcome his assurance today that in future ministers will study reports before they come out with statements about them <e> <s> will he be good enough to respond rather more sympathetically to the appeal of the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham for a debate <e> <s> the church is not the usual channels <e> <s> it speaks with far more authority than the usual channels <e> <s> would the minister be good enough to be rather more helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble viscount lord buckmaster for initiating this debate and for his knowledgeable and important speech <e> <s> the noble lords interest in the subject of human rights is well known and his knowledge of uganda and other parts of the african continent enable him to speak with authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the noble lord a little further on the question put by the noble lord lord home of the hirsel who when he asked about the negotiability of the programme received what i thought was a very terse reply from his noble friend the minister <e> <s> is it the ministers view that the programme is not negotiable and cannot be put on the agenda for the geneva talks <e> <s> if the united states took the initiative would not that ensure that the programme was on the agenda <e> <s> why does the minister say that it is not a negotiable point on the agenda for the geneva talks <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it would be a mistake to underestimate the need for part-time firemen in the rural areas especially in summer time <e> <s> is he aware that fires occur throughout the rural areas of great britain in summer time and that the need for firemen at short notice is apparent to all who live in the rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the announcement made by the noble baroness about the visit to the middle east by her honourable friend <e> <s> can she say whether the middle east crisis was on the agenda of the talks between president reagan and mr gorbachev at geneva and if so whether any future arrangements were made for formal talks on this crucial subject <e> <s> can she say further whether her majestys government have been consulted on this matter by the united states government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made a very important point in reply to an earlier question i took a note of it when he said that british firms will be working <e> <s> is it clear therefore that work is going to be found for british firms in british factories <e> <s> have the government made a calculation of the job prospects and are they satisfied that smaller firms in this country will be able to compete with the large american firms <e> <s> does the agreement albeit secret at this point provide specifically that certain areas of the work will be carried out by british firms <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i think it is very important that the minister should make it abundantly clear that there is no positive commitment at this stage and that the phrase he used earlier that british firms will be working is not precise <e> <s> in fact what he said is that there are areas of interest and expertise but he must be clear when he is at the box that he makes a positive statement <e> <s> i should be glad if he would withdraw what he said earlier that british firms will be working because there is no certainty of that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is a considerable amount of concern in south wales about this matter because it is not the first time that the government have acted imprudently in connection with this bridge <e> <s> can he say what amount of money was involved <e> <s> how much money was mistakenly charged in view of the error of the secretary of state in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that representations from charitable organisations are currently being considered by his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and his colleagues at the treasury <e> <s> can he say to his noble friend in the house that this particular point is also being considered as part of that study and therefore something might conceivably emerge in the budget on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears to say that this is a private matter <e> <s> would be confirm however that the government have in fact been heavily involved in proceedings throughout and that it is a matter of public importance and of considerable interest <e> <s> while it is a private sector matter will he say to the house that the government and the cabinet have in fact argued the merits of both these proposals <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether the anglo-american agreement gives the united kingdom any direction <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble baroness that is not an answer to my question <e> <s> i was referring to the anglo-american agreement on sdi and i asked the noble baroness whether in fact we have any control over the direction of the matter or whether we are merely hoping to get a little work out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the answer given to the private notice question asked in another place <e> <s> we also appreciate the spirit of the noble baronesss brief reply <e> <s> we are conscious that landlocked within south africa as it is lesotho is in a sensitive and difficult position <e> <s> the noble baroness will recall the raid into lesotho by south africa on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for explaining this bill to the house in a clear and helpful speech <e> <s> it comes to us as she has said at the request of the australian government under the provisions of section of the statute of westminster and it has the support of the opposition in the australian parliament <e> <s> i have read the second reading debate in the commonwealth parliament upon their own legislation that is the australia request and consent bill and their australia bill which took place on th november last <e> <s> i studied the debate with great interest and the speeches on both sides of their house left us in no doubt that the desire for this bill in australia is unanimous <e> <s> that is quite understandable <e> <s> the residual constitutional and legal links are no longer meaningful save to the extent that her majesty the queen remains involved <e> <s> we must respect the wishes of the commonwealth and states parliaments <e> <s> by so <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the ghastly and hideous procedures referred to by the noble lord lord peyton will have to be overcome before a spade is put into the ground <e> <s> is it not possible

place in february <e> <s> this will be followed by the concession agreement between the governments and the channel tunnel group <e> <s> then legislation will be introduced into the house as soon as possible and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords if so much is known of development on both sides in this important field why are the facts not laid on the table in geneva following the apparently improved relations between mr gorbachev and president reagan during their last meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness lady young for repeating the statement <e> <s> the events that have been taking place in south yemen which have left up to people either dead or wounded are disgraceful and deplorable <e> <s> we join in the expressions of sympathy to those who have been through this ordeal and we pay our warmest tribute to those who have participated in the rescue missions especially the captains and crews of hms britannia hms newcastle hms jupiter and the royal fleet auxiliary brambleleaf <e> <s> their conduct has been exemplary throughout <e> <s> we also warmly endorse the tribute paid in the statement to the ambassador and his staff <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating that long and serious statement <e> <s> it is in fact very serious for it affects the way in which ministers and senior civil servants deal with the nations affairs <e> <s> i am bound to say that the critical points are clothed in a good deal of verbiage <e> <s> a number of important questions arise from the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime minister says according to the statement that she would have found a different way <e> <s> she had ample opportunity to consider the way she was dealing with it <e> <s> she is the prime minister of this country <e> <s> she has ample advice at her disposal <e> <s> why did she allow this squalid development to take place without adequate concern for her colleague in the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for the way he has answered the questions but he has not dealt with a major point which i raised in relation to the hole-and-corner way in which this matter was dealt with <e> <s> it was made clear by mr chris moncrieff on behalf of the press association that the information was passed to him confidentially <e> <s> why was it done in that way <e> <s> why was it leaked at all <e> <s> why was it not put forward in an open public fashion <e> <s> that is the question people are asking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all congratulate the noble and learned lord lord templeman and the other noble lords who sit on sub-committee e for this most impressive report <e> <s> the house is also grateful to the noble and learned lord for his admirable opening speech which gave us a clear exposition of the problems involved in this study <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness and so i am sure is the house for that additional explanation <e> <s> of course that makes it all the more necessary for the british parliament to be kept informed or an appropriate committee of the british parliament because the noble baroness lady elles referred to information being passed to a committee of the european parliament and not to the parliament itself <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness resumes her seat may i put one important matter <e> <s> the noble baroness has made a full and detailed speech for which we are extremely grateful <e> <s> but she has not moved an inch in the direction of the committee or any of the recommendations that it makes <e> <s> for example paragraph criticised the lack of adequate machinery <e> <s> the answer by the noble baroness to that was to say that nothing more can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord with regard to the statement and its reference in particular to reckless spending in wales we understand that the noble viscount was repeating a statement made by his right honourable friend in another place and therefore is not responsible for it <e> <s> however will he tell the house that the evidence that he has produced of reckless spending does not support the contention <e> <s> he named one county council out of eight county councils in wales <e> <s> is he aware that the known reputation of welsh county councils is one of very careful spending indeed <e> <s> will he now concede that to the house and assure the house that he will discuss this with his right honourable friend as soon as possible <e> <s> otherwise the people of wales will be less civil to the secretary of state than they have been over the last six years <e>", "<cs> my lords mr gorbachev made certain proposals just before the geneva summit and since then the moratorium on testing has been extended by a further three months <e> <s> will the noble baroness say whether these matters are on the agenda for the us- european talks and can she say whether those proposals could possibly be of assistance towards establishing a comprehensive test-ban treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will allow me to refer to a grave development namely the very sharp rise in unemployment announced by the department of employment today <e> <s> there are of course complicated figures but the short point is that the unadjusted figures show that there are more unemployed than there were a month ago <e> <s> the position now is that there are over million unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsible minister is the secretary of state for employment who is a member of this house and i think the house would wish to know whether he proposes to make a statement on this new and serious development <e>", "<cs> my lords the availability of opportunity to raise this matter in the house has been discussed by my noble friend lord stoddart <e> <s> but may i say that i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said about the possibility of discussion on this matter through the usual channels and possibly in the procedure committee as well <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what precisely is meant by research <e> <s> he is aware that there has been considerable concern over the past few years about the new coinage introduced by the government <e> <s> can he <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the criticisms from this house will the noble lord arrange for human performance tests to take place here <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not argue against the principle does the noble viscount not agree that it is absolutely essential before any action is taken on a matter such as this that there should be full and detailed consultation with every possible interested party <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have announced that this service presents a formidable funding and technical problem <e> <s> can the noble baroness give the house some idea of the magnitude of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords while warmly supporting the tribute paid in the statement to mr john elfed jones and the board would the noble viscount the minister confirm that they were in fact strongly opposed to this measure of privatisation <e> <s> secondly as to the new director general will he make quite plain that this statement proposes that authority should be moved out of wales where it now rests with the board and the secretary of state for wales to a director general stationed in england <e> <s> thirdly can the minister say what measures are being taken to privatise water undertakings in scotland along the same lines as they are being privatised in england and wales <e> <s> lastly is the noble viscount aware that this statement will be received in wales with profound disquiet because it has complex political implications <e> <s> for that reason will he please convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales and to the prime minister a strong appeal from me and my colleagues to think again about this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be forgiven for following immediately upon my noble friend <e> <s> the noble baroness may have a perfectly good explanation but does she agree that beds for wales is a low figure and one out of all proportion to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one aspect of the governments policy is quite clear namely that the revenue from oil of f billion should go to meet the cost of the dole which is billion <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on the official secrets act last march the noble lord lord elton said and i think i quote his words accurately that section is imperfect <e> <s> in view of that and of the general public concern about this section of the act can the noble and learned lord say what the government have done in the meantime to introduce an amendment or new legislation to deal with a matter which is of acute public concern <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to translate into terms of employment the statistics that he gave two answers ago <e> <s> how many jobs in fact will be created as a result of the actions of the government to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> we warmly support the good wishes extended to president aquino and the new government and wish them all success in their formidable task <e> <s> we have also noticed with admiration both her courage and that of the filipino people who stood between the conflicting armed forces and whose will prevailed thus avoiding significant loss of life or excessive violence <e> <s> we have also admired the role of the church as a calming influence throughout recent weeks <e> <s> we further recognise the quick appreciation of a dangerous situation by the united states government and the decisive way that they acted towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis during the past few days <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying to the house that he has forgotten lloyd george entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hooson has raised a subject that is both important and timely and one that to us as parliamentarians and politicians is intensely interesting as well <e> <s> the noble lords opening speech was a thoughtful introduction to our debate <e> <s> i probably agree with most of what he said excepting only the slight party political flavour he gave to his remarks at certain points <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord clarify this matter beyond peradventure <e> <s> is he saying clearly that there will be no purchaser except a british purchaser <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the considerable uncertainty which remains on this issue would the noble lord be good enough to ask his right honourable friend to make a statement in another place which can be repeated here so that we may clarify this matter beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that all the evidence shows that the housing problem in this country is now approaching a critical situation <e> <s> is he further aware that this house will be pleased that his right honourable friend is conducting a review <e> <s> will the minister tell the house what are the terms of reference of that review and when its findings are likely to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the secretary of states constant advocacy of government policy can he tell the house when government policy will result in a substantial reduction in unemployment <e> <s> will it be in months three years or five years <e> <s> it is time the government predicted when unemployment is to come down <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of time would have been saved had my noble friend been allowed to pursue his question <e> <s> i think we are acting contrary to the interests of the house by intervening too much <e> <s> i am sure that if my noble friend would conclude his question that will settle the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness explain to the house what precisely is the policy of her majestys government on this issue <e> <s> do the government approve of the sale of arms to countries whose economic affairs are in a complete shambles <e> <s> is a countrys economic situation taken into account before the government approve the sale of armaments to that country <e> <s> secondly will the minister say what

details of this memorandum are to be published by her majestys government <e> <s> can she also say how many contracts have resulted from this memorandum and what are the value of the contracts <e>",

ferranti <e> <s> what is the nature of the contracts and what employment will flow from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will welcome the fact that the government are taking this grim disease seriously and are proposing to take action and spend money on this campaign <e> <s> can the minister tell the house at this stage what are the statistics <e> <s> she said there were a number of permutations <e> <s> does she feel that at the moment the disease is under control or is it out of control <e> <s> what are the percentage figures over the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords

motion of my noble friend deals with the central problem and challenge facing the world and we must be grateful to him for moving it and also for his speech <e> <s> he has described the horrors of nuclear war and no one would dissent from his conclusions certainly not after reading the british medical association report to which he referred <e> <s> my noble friend also mentioned the proposal for an international standing commission <e> <s> we await the comments of the noble baroness on that with interest <e> <s> my noble friend also mentioned mr olof palme <e> <s> i know that we all share the sense of acute loss of a man who worked unremittingly for peace <e> <s> we particularly remember his chairmanship of the independent commission on disarmament and security to which my noble friend referred his support for the brandt report and his efforts to resolve the iran-iraq conflict <e> <s> he was the independent leader of a relatively small country who played a significant and admirable role on the worlds stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that the difficulty arises in the main because we are not in diplomatic relations with iran <e> <s> will the noble baroness say what is the reciprocal position in relation to our embassy in tehran <e>", "<cs> my lords while we appear to live in an age of declaratory gestures which are not always helpful is it not the case that the deputy soviet foreign minister mr komplektov recently said that the soviet union was prepared to negotiate on site verification and the possibility of a full test ban treaty <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us what steps her majestys government are taking towards the possibility of talks on those two subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect does the minister not agree that the moratorium is not a declaratory gesture but a fact which has been taking place for some months <e> <s> will the minister therefore say what steps her majestys government are now taking to clarify whether or not the moratorium is the condition that he describes it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness deal with the point that my noble friend has made about the additional political qualification which is not on the list that she read out to the house <e> <s> to what extent is it true that nominations of this kind are vetted by the conservative party central office as was

clear <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us whether evidence has been submitted to the commission and whether any steps are being taken in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the commission is proposing to prosecute and if the evidence is clear why it is not doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the help that her majestys government are now giving to poland and to a lesser degree hungary <e>", "<cs> my lords on a first hearing of the statement i am bound to say and regret to say that there is a dangerous element of recklessness about it <e> <s> will the minister be good enough to define the meaning of contractorisation a word that i have never heard before <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house for the

human rights record <e> <s> is the minister now certain that the record in vietnam is good enough to merit forcible repatriation <e> <s> if that is the case are the government now prepared to renew bilateral aid <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of understanding the reply will the noble lord confirm that he and the government are saying that the vietnamese human rights record is now better

and monetary union the endorsement of the social charter and the approval of the creation of a bank of europe <e> <s> if these objectives are implemented they will match in historic significance the developments in eastern europe and banish the cold war once and for all <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> however while we recognise the grave

it not the case that her majestys government have been selling arms to indonesia and against the background of what the noble lord said in his initial reply is that not inconsistent <e> <s> can he say whether it is the policy of her majestys government to sell arms in those circumstances <e> <s> will the government use the offices of the united nations to see whether or not this war can be brought to a just end and self-determination given to the people of east timor <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for rising again but can the noble lord say how the government are able to ensure that the arms sold to the government of indonesia are not used in the war against the people of east timor <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that iraq has an appalling record on human rights and that it is responsible for killing torturing and imprisoning thousands of kurds and members of opposition parties <e> <s> it has imprisoned two british citizens and has not responded to representations made by

that is to the government by the soviet union and to those who are waging the civil war against them by israel and the gulf states <e> <s> these are all countries with which her majestys government have good relations <e> <s> therefore can he say what representations the government are making to those who are supplying arms to a country which is on the verge of an appalling famine and which is in the middle of a wicked civil war <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord therefore confirm that this important public service is being carried out efficiently and well at present in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house for his generous tribute to our late noble friend lord gardiner <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the milestones of the distinguished career of lord gardiner which culminated in his elevation to the woolsack in <e> <s> he will be remembered as one of the great lawyers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether the government still believe that the re-establishment of the trade union in gchq as the federation has requested would present a risk to national security <e> <s> secondly will he confirm to the house that the failure by the government to establish the trade union is in contravention of a number of international conventions <e> <s> for example the international labour organisation conventions and make it quite clear that the government are taking action which is contrary to the conventions <e> <s> will he also comment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be good enough to reply to the first of my supplementary questions namely whether his right honourable friend and the government generally believe that the conversion of the federation back into a trade union would present a threat to national security <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that with the knowledge of high authority in this country blunt occupied far more significant positions than gchq <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to my noble friend lord callaghan for initiating this important debate on german reunification and for his thoughtful and stimulating speech <e> <s> we have had a balanced and informed debate with important contributions from all sides and a full appreciation that the problems that arise from our discussions are difficult and

with the case put forward by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> however is it not also the case that communications between london the channel tunnel and north wales must be improved dramatically and quickly if that large and important region is to benefit from the single market in <e> <s> will he therefore convey to his right honourable friend the need for example to electrify the line from euston to holyhead and ask him that it be done as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that his noble friend made some sensible points in his supplementary question <e> <s> does he not further agree that it would be possible to hold the state opening of parliament on or near the traditional date that is during the first week in november if the government planned their legislative programme more efficiently and more thoughtfully in the interests of this house <e> <s> does he recall that when we went into recess last summer only out of bills had received royal assent <e> <s> is that not a case of inefficiency and thoughtlessness <e> <s> will he look again at the position with his right honourable friends to see whether a programme could be launched which would be less taxing and frustrating for noble lords on all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for explaining both of the orders to us <e> <s> the european school established at culham years ago has i understand been a success <e> <s> i am advised that it has a good reputation and that the children who have attended it have done well <e>", "<cs>

lords i have complete confidence in the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that whatever arguments may have been advanced about the nhs that service is in many ways suffering grievously at the moment as a result of the ambulance strike <e> <s> will she tell the house what initiatives she and her right honourable friend have to bring that dispute to an end <e>", "<cs> my

would it not be sensible for her right honourable friend the secretary of state to ask nupe representatives mr poole and his <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for getting up again but it is not good enough for the minister to say that her right honourable friend cannot be involved when he is involved every day in statements on that very issue in another place on television and on radio <e> <s> will she convey to him the desire of the house i believe on all sides that he should as a member of the cabinet and a representative of her majestys government take an initiative now which would help to bring the dispute to an end without waiting for an unstarred question in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that her reply will allay the concern which exists in wales as a result of the announcement <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said ministers rules of conduct are kept in confidence in the cabinet office <e> <s> however there is no secret about them <e> <s>

accepts the general proposition that we should follow the procedure committees advice on these matters <e> <s> however in this case i believe that when the foreign affairs spokesman of the liberal democrat party rises to his feet to ask a question the house would be prepared to listen to him <e> <s> it does not help proceedings when the government chief whip mumbles in his seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble earls difficulties but would he not agree on reflection that it is somewhat premature to say that a further or wider inquiry may not be necessary <e> <s> is it not the case that what parliament and the country will hear in due course when the distinguished lawyer mr calcutt has completed his work is a statement by his right honourable friend and as the noble lord lord harris has said that the substance of that statement and the evidence which mr calcutt hears will not be made available to parliament or to the country <e>", "<cs> my lords are the obvious advantages of cardiff airport being taken into account by the authorities <e> <s> the airport in cardiff is now as modern as any in the country outside heathrow and gatwick <e> <s> also cardiff is in close proximity to the midlands and london <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side fully agree with and support everything the minister said in his original reply to the question <e> <s> in view of the

peace plan now takes on an even greater urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be a difficult question to answer but i should like to ask whether there is any danger that the khmer rouge might occupy most of cambodia before the security council is able to act and before the australian plan is put into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords while we appreciate the unilateral assistance which her majestys

european countries including the soviet union <e> <s> should not the policies of this country and our allies be to ensure that at this critical point in history we should be doing everything we can to

that if the recommendations are to be implemented substantial additional resources will be essential <e> <s> she mentioned the initiatives of the polytechnics she did not mention the universities <e> <s> can she say what discussions have been held between her department and the cvcp on the implications of wooding for the universities <e> <s> she also mentioned the universities funding council <e> <s> can she be more specific and say what is being done by the council in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness answer my question concerning discussions with the cvcp <e>", "<cs> my lords we warmly welcome the noble earl to his new office and wish him every success in it <e> <s> we are also grateful to him for his comprehensive speech in which he set the scene for this most important debate <e>", "<cs> even if they do not agree in every detail to have the two great powers on the same wavelength at this critical time must be of profound importance <e> <s> over the past month i have often thought about what might have happened if this crisis had broken seven to years ago when the soviet union had a very different leadership <e> <s> this understanding must be preserved and increased <e> <s> we therefore warmly welcome the meeting between president bush and president gorbachev in helsinki this coming weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will take the house a stage further and say what policies the government intend to introduce to take advantage of the new situation created by our membership of the erm <e> <s> further following on what was said by the noble lords lord obrien and lord ezra is the minister aware that the country will take the view that the government committed a grave error of judgment in not taking this step seven or even five years ago <e> <s> does the minister agree with the view expressed today and in the past few days by his right honourable friend the former chancellor of the exchequer mr nigel lawson that this country could have been saved a great deal of suffering had the prime minister and the government accepted his advice five years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl resumes his seat this may be an appropriate moment to ask him why on this first day of the sitting of parliament after the long recess television is not present <e> <s> a number of noble lords have drawn my attention to this matter <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl can help us <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not agree that there has been a great deal of public disquiet regarding what people believe to be an unreasonable increase in price <e> <s> does he further agree that many authorities including president bush say that the increase in prices is not justifiable <e> <s> can he say what representations were made by his right honourable friend or some representative of the government to the oil companies about this matter <e> <s> finally can he say what extra revenue has come to the government since nd august as a result of this increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble viscount <e> <s> it has come to my notice that the increased revenue amounts to more than million <e> <s> is that near the mark <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble earl for that information <e> <s> of course we fully support all the actions which the government are taking in this particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he said <e> <s> may we all assume that if there is a further development a statement will be made in this house immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of the house as a whole perhaps i may turn to the constitutional point referred to by the noble lord lord tordoff and indeed by the noble lord in his reply <e> <s> is it not the case that when the minister replied to his noble friend on monday ministers knew perfectly well that a statement was to be made by the secretary of state at the conservative party conference on tuesday <e> <s> further is it not the constitutional position that when this house is sitting parliament is sitting <e> <s> therefore the way that this matter has been handled is in my view unquestionably in contempt of this house <e> <s> the least that the noble lord can do on behalf of the government is to apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords during the recess a number of welsh farmers made representations to me about the disgraceful conduct for which there is no possible excuse <e> <s> can the minister be more explicit about the compensation to which she referred in her answer <e> <s> who has applied for compensation <e> <s> is it from government to government or by some other way <e> <s> can she be precise about the amount of compensation expected how it is to be assessed and the procedures that are to be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to an extremely complex crime <e> <s> can the minister say what resources the government make available to the police authority to deal with it <e> <s> can he further tell the house how many qualified accountants such as chartered accountants are employed by the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that intelligence is necessary but cannot the noble lord tell the house whether any chartered accountants are employed to deal with such crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that exports of nuclear materials and technology to iraq have ceased <e> <s> will he also confirm that the visit by the international atomic energy agency to verify iraqs stockpile of nuclear materials which is scheduled for november will still take place <e> <s> there is a good deal of concern that that visit which would be of considerable importance should continue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that the situation is critical in the south east and in the south west <e> <s> what is the position in the north of england scotland and wales <e> <s> is it not the case that we have a surplus in those areas <e> <s> can she confirm that there has been a study into the possibility of constructing pipelines from those areas where water is abundant to the unfortunate areas of the south east and the south west <e> <s> in wales we would be extremely glad to arrange that provided the financial terms were appropriate <e> <s> does she not agree that this is something that should be looked at again <e>", "<cs> my lords there are currently signatories to the non-proliferation treaty <e> <s> is it not the case that south africa which has a formidable stockpile of nuclear materials and technology has not yet signed <e> <s> can he say whether the government have sought to influence that government to sign the treaty <e> <s> secondly is it not the case that the international atomic energy agency which is short of resources at the present time has a vital role to play <e> <s> do the government have any intention of helping it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that we on this side of the house also regret that the soviet union is unable to allow mrs gordievski and her two daughters to join her husband in this country <e> <s> can he say whether our embassy officials in moscow are able to see mrs gordievski frequently or whether that communication has been cut by the soviet authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the increasingly acute anxiety felt throughout the country about the increase in the number of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies which are after all the seedcorn of industry in the future <e> <s> what are the government doing about that <e> <s> furthermore what steps are the government taking to ameliorate the problem and prevent the closure of cammell laird in birkenhead which will result in the loss of jobs in an area where unemployment is high <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case nevertheless that the government will benefit substantially from the increase in petrol prices <e> <s> is the minister aware that i received a helpful letter from the noble viscount lord ullswater in which he stated that so far as the treasury can calculate the government will benefit to the sum of well over million this year and to well over million next year <e> <s> how will that money be spent <e> <s> is it to be spent in the current spending round <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate the acute difficulty of those negotiations and support the efforts of her majestys government to bring the matter to a conclusion <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government support the proposal that the proposed supreme national council for cambodia should contain representatives of the khmer rouge <e> <s> as regards the point raised by my noble friend lady ewart-biggs about the appalling suffering of the people of cambodia can the minister say when the un development programme money which i believe amounts to million dollars will be released to help the people of cambodia <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> in the statement the foreign secretary refers to the objectives of the united nations laid down in the security council resolutions and <e> <s> it speaks of the effective blockade now in operation <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an unfortunate and longstanding dispute and i am sure that the government are doing their best to resolve it <e> <s> when did british ministers last meet spanish ministers to discuss this matter <e> <s> as regards the point made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock will the minister say whether the attitude of the government of gibraltar towards the airport remains the same <e>", "<cs> my lords has the action taken by gibraltar against the ec council which was referred to by the noble lord lord merrivale been settled <e> <s> what is the attitude of her majestys government towards that action <e> <s> do they support it <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any truth in the report that the reason why the government have not yet ratified the convention is because they oppose articles and of the convention which lay down that children are not to be separated from their families <e> <s> the articles further state that if children are separated from their families they should be reunited humanely <e> <s> does the minister agree that that concept should not pose a difficulty <e> <s> it is a point of compassion which i should have thought the government would support at once <e> <s> will the minister confirm that about children are dying <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again but i respectfully suggest that the minister has not dealt with the point i made about articles and <e> <s> do these form an obstacle to the governments ratification of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again <e> <s> i pressed the point as did my noble friend because of a case which came to my attention of kurdish parents in this country who applied for their child who was seriously ill in turkey to join them here <e> <s> because of delays inherent in the system of which the noble lord is aware the child was not allowed to come to this country and died <e> <s> does he agree that that is not in the tradition of governments in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into the substance of this important statement i should like to ask the noble and learned lord for clarification <e> <s> it has come to our notice that the statement made by the noble and learned lord is different from the statement the secretary of state is now making in the other place <e> <s> i may be mistaken but in the years or so that i have been in these buildings i have never known that to happen before <e> <s> i wonder whether the statement the secretary of state is making <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord i do not criticise him <e> <s> his admission that it is an innovation will be helpful to the whole house <e> <s> i see the reasons perfectly well <e> <s> i am obliged for his explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house has not answered part of my noble friends question <e> <s> how does he justify depriving this house of a good minister of state merely for the purpose of seeking to resolve the dire political problems of the conservative party in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for repeating that wide-ranging statement <e> <s> it leads us to certain conclusions one of which is that at this moment community affairs are to say the least unsatisfactory certainly from a british viewpoint <e> <s> the rome summit has left us isolated once again <e> <s> that must be a cause for acute concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this debate be adjourned until tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question asked by the noble lord lord thomson is the minister aware that the entire matter has grave implications <e> <s> can he say whether the meeting at downing street took place at the request of mr murdoch in order to discuss matters about which the prime minister had been given proper prior notice <e> <s> in view of the substance of the conversation will the minister say whether anyone from his department was present to advise the prime minister especially in view of the fact that the broadcasting bill was then going through this house <e> <s> i realise that the minister may be in a difficult position but it may help the government if he can clarify the situation so that there is no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords while noting what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said is the minister aware that we welcome the signing of the cfe treaty on th november <e> <s> taking account of the great changes in europe notably the collapse of the warsaw pact is there not a case for proceeding with urgency towards a second cfe treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord caithness for his wide-ranging introduction to the debate <e> <s> as he said one of the difficulties about debates on foreign affairs and defence is the impossibility of doing justice to every facet of so very large a subject <e> <s> i shall try to concentrate on two or three of the immediate problems facing us at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i also join the noble earl in condemning and deploring the conduct of iraqi forces in kuwait <e> <s> one of the pretexts for the invasion was that kuwait was part of iraq and that its people were moslem brothers and sisters desiring to return to the family <e> <s> but all the evidence shows that kuwaitis and others resident there have been treated with extreme brutality <e> <s> one report from amnesty international after interviews with scores of people who have fled kuwait reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord to look for a moment beyond offas dyke <e> <s> is he aware that the number of welsh companies going into receivership has increased fourfold during the first nine months of this year while at the same time the government have cut aid to industry by per cent <e> <s> can the minister explain that <e>", "<cs> my lords when mr rupert murdoch met the prime minister recently to discuss these matters did she say that she was in favour of the merger or did she then consult the home secretary about the possibility of a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the unemployment position in wales is especially serious and is worsening from month to month <e> <s> for example in laura ashley p b electronics brymbo steelworks inmos and other industries a large number of redundancies has been created <e> <s> in those circumstances how does the minister justify the government cutting the training budget by million over the next two years <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the commission has made a number of specific proposals which were published on th november <e> <s> it would not be proper for me to go into them in detail which i could do <e> <s> i am quite prepared to pass them to the minister <e> <s> will he answer the question put by my noble friend <e> <s> do the government subscribe to these proposals and are they cooperating within the commission to make sure that they are implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that political violence in south africa is damaging the prospects of a settlement between the anc and the south african government and that the evidence shows that it is wrong to seek to lay the blame on the anc <e> <s> were those matters discussed in the talks between the prime minister and chief buthelezi a few days ago <e> <s> if so what recommendations or advice did the right honourable lady proffer to the chief <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the ministers reply to his noble friend does he agree that the chief objective is to have free and fair elections in south africa in which anc members can have an opportunity to stand <e>", "<cs> my lords before i proceed to the debate i feel i must refer to the events which are very much in our minds at this time namely the impending resignation of the prime minister which is not unrelated to the subject of this debate <e> <s> the right honourable lady has occupied her high office for years <e> <s> while we were often dismayed and occasionally distressed by her policies nevertheless we always recognised her clarity confidence and courage <e>", "<cs> my lords without speculating can the noble baroness help the house by saying which of the three policies now being discussed by mr heseltine mr hurd and mr major is favoured by the right honourable lady the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> as the house knows we have broadly supported the governments handling of the crisis throughout <e> <s> we appreciate this further clarification of policy <e> <s> we note with great interest that a new resolution is to be considered shortly in the security council with a view to ensuring iraqi compliance with resolution and the other resolutions <e> <s> we also note the important new element in it namely that a date by which iraq is required to comply with the resolutions will be set <e> <s> we further observe that it is still hoped that existing pressures will suffice to persuade saddam hussein to withdraw and that military action need not necessarily take place on the appointed date <e> <s> can the minister say whether any further diplomatic action is proposed in order to underline the determination of the united nations to secure the withdrawal <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords before we proceed to the days business i hope that i may on behalf of my noble friends and noble lords in all parts of the house pay a warm tribute to the noble lord lord belstead for the way he has conducted the affairs of this house as its leader over the past three years <e> <s> the noble lord brought great experience to that office because he had served in a number of departments <e> <s> that became clear during his tenure especially when he took part in our debates <e> <s> in my view he has proved himself a splendid parliamentarian with the ability to open and wind up debates on a variety of subjects and to think on his feet <e> <s> however his greatest gift was his readiness to see every point of view and to help us all to the greatest extent <e> <s> i believe he is the only leader in the history of the house who was kind enough to smile even when he lost a division <e> <s> i greatly hope that mr david waddington will follow his example <e> <s> we wish the noble lord lord belstead every success in his new office <e> <s> we also wish mr david waddington every success when he takes up his new office in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the legislative council of hong kong has the power to abolish the death penalty in hong kong by way of order in council <e> <s> would her majestys government not advise the legislative council that they would support such action <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl says that there does not seem to be a majority <e> <s> on what grounds does he say that <e> <s> is it quite clear to the government that there is no majority <e> <s> my understanding is that a large number of people would be very glad to see the death penalty abolished in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is as the noble earl said a strong feeling in favour of the death penalty in hong kong why has there been no protest against commutation over the past years <e>"]
