["<cs> my lords i wish to make only one brief observation regarding the legal position of the budget which as is explained in the report before your lordships was very unsatisfactory <e> <s> on th <e>", "<cs> i too had not intended to intervene at this stage but stung by what the noble lord lord wigoder said a moment ago about lack of support for the clause i ought briefly to indicate my support <e> <s> i agree very much with my noble and learned friend lord wheatley and with the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> one of the great difficulties about this region of the law seems to me to be that if the police powers are inadequate it is inevitably a temptation for them to exceed their powers and to act illegally <e> <s> that is a serious <e>", "<cs> i am not at all accepting the construction put upon this by the noble earl <e> <s> if we struck out subsection i doubt very much whether the police would be entitled to re-detain <e> <s> it is open to very grave doubt <e> <s> however that is not worth arguing about now and with the leave of the committee i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not move my amendment on the basis that the undertaking given also applies to that <e>", "<cs> would the noble and learned lord the lord advocate say whether or not there is confusion in this subsection <e> <s> the first provision paragraph i is refuses to give information within his knowledge <e> <s> as i understood it the lord advocate said that that would be a matter of prosecution and if necessary the sheriff who was presiding at the precognition would i suppose give evidence about what happened <e> <s> anyway it would require to be proved by other evidence that he must have had this knowledge when he refused to give it <e> <s> that seems to me to be a matter for separate trial afterwards <e>", "<cs> i do not regard the matter as quite satisfactory <e> <s> i do not know how the sheriff could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt except very rarely if there is a document <e> <s> if it depended on the evidence of other witnesses it would require to be dealt with later <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord foot i do not think that he is right in his contruction here because what he is to be free from is all question or process for the crime <e> <s> i do not think that that means questioning about the crime <e> <s> no doubt the lord advocate will consider this matter <e> <s> with the leave of the committee shall withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i wish to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the explanation given by the lord advocate was interesting and i appreciate it but it seems to raise a new horror are the judges themselves otherwise supposed to take in the food for the jury <e>", "<cs> i should like to correct any impression i may have given if i did give the impression that i think the crime of murder is to be treated lightly <e> <s> i am far from wishing to suggest any such thing <e> <s> i do not believe that and i hope i did not give that impression <e> <s> if i may refer to one or two of the points the noble earl lord mansfield put forward which appeared to me to be less than satisfactory answers to what i was saying he said that at present the power of the judges to make recommendations for a minimum period is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say briefly that in my view the clause is right as it stands <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble lord lord foot said about this <e> <s> whoever is going to ask the questions will have to prepare himself read up the case and know what questions to ask <e> <s> that is not the business of the sheriff in the ordinary case <e> <s> if he had to do that we should be going a long way down the road towards an inquisitorial system <e> <s> it is much better that these questions should be asked by the procurator fiscal who will know what the appropriate questions are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add one comment to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has just said <e> <s> one of the matters on which denial or explanation is relevant is in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mishcon i should like to welcome this clause which meets one of the points which i raised at the last stage <e> <s> i want to ask one question about the use of the ards <e> <s> should or should not <e> <s> the new subsection says that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment proposed by my noble and learned friend lord keith <e> <s> may i just remind your lordships in one word that the present law of scotland is that when a person is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder the judge may make a recommendation as to the minimum period of his detention <e> <s> the judge is not obliged to do that <e> <s> exactly the same applies in england the judge may make a recommendation but is not obliged to <e> <s> my information is that both in scotland and in england very few recommendations have actually been made by judges presumably because they do not think it appropriate to do so <e> <s> i certainly do not recall having made a recommendation myself as a judge in those circumstances <e> <s> i have made inquiries in scotland and i am informed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very likely reasonable <e> <s> i did not actually know that but i fully accept it <e> <s> i am simply saying that that particular difficulty does not now arise so there is no reason to change the law to deal with that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords commons amendment no <e> <s> introduced a new clause to the bill having the effect that a homosexual act committed in private shall not be an offence in scotland provided both parties consent and are over <e> <s> i am not disputing the principle of this new clause at all <e> <s> my amendment is to introduce a clarifying provision to help clear up what is meant by in private <e> <s> your lordships will see that subsection provides that a homosexual act in private shall not be an offence but subsection a provides that it shall continue to be an offence if committed in public <e> <s> the purpose of my amendment is to make clear just what is meant by in private in two respects <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reply very briefly <e> <s> i understand that nearly everybody who has spoken seems to approve of my amendment as being an improvement of the clause if the clause is approved at all <e> <s> a good deal of discussion has ranged rather more widely than i had originally expected <e> <s> the only criticism as i understood it of my amendment came from the noble lord lord boothby who said that it was not necessary in scotland <e> <s> i really cannot understand that argument because it seems to me that it is easy to imagine circumstances in which it might be doubtful whether a particular act was in private or not <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the position amendment no <e> <s> a was disposed of a few minutes ago and i was about to move amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already explained that amendment no <e> <s> b is consequential upon no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a as an amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this clause as it stands at present contains a very clear example of retrospective legislation and i put down my amendment to try to remove the retrospective element in the legislation <e> <s> i do not suppose that the casual reader if there is one here would have spotted the fact that it is retrospective because the clause is somewhat obscure <e> <s> it is not surprising because it forms part of a group of legislation an earlier example of which on exactly the same subject was described by the late lord reid as being <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am wholly convinced by the arguments on either side the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey seemed to say that it was a rich insurance company against a poor man and the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said that there were very few cases <e> <s> with great respect i do not consider either of those arguments to be very good for breaking the rule that there should not be retrospective legislation <e> <s> however having ventilated that with the leave of the house i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the very full reply he has given to the points raised <e> <s> i am glad to notice that the governments view seems to be in exact coincidence with that of the committee that all the points mentioned in the report do require consideration at any rate by the government in the course of negotiation <e> <s> as i expected the debate has ranged a good deal beyond the boundaries of this particular report and i am not going to make any attempt to deal with the points raised except one and that is the question of whether this draft directive is within the <e>", "<cs> this is one more occasion when the committee will have the edifying spectacle <e>", "<cs> i should like also to support this amendment in principle <e> <s> i think that the words of the present clause are taken from the recent decision in this house of the <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point raised by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london about church courts i considered that matter more from the angle of the church of scotland with which i am more familiar than from the angle of the church of england <e> <s> it seemed to me to raise great difficulties for the courts of the church of scotland go right down to kirksession <e> <s> i do not believe anybody would think that it was right to protect kirksession against contempt of court <e> <s> i certainly would not do so <e> <s> the same may be true of some of the lower courts of the church of england <e> <s> however i am not very familiar with them <e> <s> to let in many church courts would probably be a mistake <e>", "<cs> notaries public are common bodies to be found in scotland <e> <s> about half the solicitors in scotland are notaries public <e>", "<cs> while i do not wish to oppose the amendment i suggest that the subsection as a whole should be looked at <e> <s> it begins by saying the court shall grant an application <e> <s> i should have thought we were here in a discretionary kind of region and that more appropriate words might be the court may grant an application which would seem to go better with the substitution of words being proposed <e> <s> i am not sure whether i should be making this point now or on the clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i think that the minster is plainly right on this matter <e> <s> it should be intolerable if there could be pronounced an order excluding a man from what had hitherto been his home without his knowing anything about it <e> <s> he might return home and find himself in contempt of court by entering what he thought was his own house <e> <s> there could well be a malicious wife who made entirely unfounded assertions against an absent husband and he might return to find that position prevailing <e> <s> in my submission it would be absolutely intolerable to allow that to arise <e>", "<cs> i should like to support <e>", "<cs> may i venture to encourage the minister in his attitude <e> <s> if there is a fear of the wife being accosted or molested at her work or at the school she can get an interdict against that conduct by her husband <e> <s> but this proposal is to exclude the husband from entering or remaining in an area <e> <s> to say he is not to go to the area where the school is or where the wife works which may be in a street down which he has to pass to his own work or for some perfectly legitimate reason is quite a strong thing to do <e> <s> she can get an interdict against him misbehaving there <e> <s> if it is unnecessary as i should have thought it was to have this order excluding him from going to the area at all i should have thought it was desirable not to extend the power beyond what it is at the moment <e> <s> what the scottish law commission recommended was excluding him from an area which included the house which is i think exactly what is in the bill <e> <s> i should have thought there was great objection to extending it to other areas unless it is absolutely necessary and as far as i can see it is not necessary <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome this amendment in principle <e> <s> i suggest that the drafting is not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> it provides that <e>", "<cs> exactly the same point about ensuring arises here <e> <s> it is not so easy to provide the sanction here but it ought to be possible in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add only a footnote to what has been said by the noble baroness lady white and my noble and learned friend lord scarman in commending the report to your lordships attention <e> <s> i was the chairman of the legal sub-committee which gave first consideration to the report and i was very glad when the subcommittee was replaced in the later stages by a more comprehensive sub-committee appointed for the purpose and not limited to lawyers because this is not by any means only a lawyers problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl lord selkirk that non-applicant is not a happy word <e> <s> i should have ventured to suggest that the word other would be much more appropriate here <e> <s> if you look at paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view the noble lord lord ross is right because habit and repute suggests they are reputed to be husband and wife whereas i should have thought the clause was intended to deal with the case of people who nobody supposed were married but whom the general public knew were living together <e> <s> if that is the case then the amendment would not seem appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say i think that the noble earl is quite right not to press the wording of this amendment <e> <s> in my view it is obviously unhappily worded because if this amendment were made the definition would then read <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make what might be thought by some not to be a second reading point but to a scots lawyer it is a second reading point <e> <s> the question is is the bill meant to apply to scotland or is it not <e> <s> the matter is very far from clear because we find in clause a provision which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to indicate any view on the bill <e> <s> it came to my notice only today <e> <s> i am not qualified to speak for scottish public opinion without at least canvassing some friends <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one note in agreement with the last two speakers on the question of rights <e> <s> one of the classes of interest in property referred to in the new subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may give my support to the proposal which has been made by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and i gather agreed to by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i am probably the only person in the chamber who has been in the position of a judge wanting advice from a reporter or some such person in dealing with cases of children <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey said they are often quite urgent with the school holidays coming up and so on and it is very useful to know to whom you can go <e> <s> in my day you asked your clerk and if he happened to see a young member of the bar at the back of the court who was not employed he would call mister so-and-so or more likely miss so-and-so <e> <s> that is all right but it is not a very satisfactory system <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey is being a trifle cynical in his description of what went on in his young days <e> <s> it was true that the young advocates did a lot of the work but when there was an important case particularly in murder trials they always obtained the assistance of a senior and experienced counsel who was there to give his services free <e> <s> that was a well-known practice <e> <s> it is a little unrealistic to look back to those days <e> <s> i do not know the number of criminal prosecutions or civil litigation actions in those days compared to now but it was enormously less <e> <s> it is one thing to carry a free system of legal aid on the shoulders of the legal profession when there are few cases and quite another thing with the enormous number of cases that we now have <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to associate myself with my noble and learned friend lord scarman in his amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree with it <e> <s> it is only with diffidence that i venture into the <e>", "<cs> that case went into this matter fairly fully and some of the scottish authorities were referred to because of earlier cases <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning got it exactly right when he said that the effect of this amendment would be to reverse the onus <e> <s> at the moment unlawfully or improperly obtained evidence has to be admitted in england unless the judge holds that its evidential value is outweighed by its prejudicial value <e> <s> the onus is on the accused to show why the improper evidence should not be allowed <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be to reverse this and put it the other way round <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i am competent to answer so general a question as that <e> <s> but there are cases where a judge would have to decide that it was a very serious offence the evidence had been unlawfully obtained but it would be a scandal to exclude the evidence and allow a man who on that evidence was likely to be convicted to escape <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments on this matter in relation to the position of the faculty of advocates <e> <s> it was rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene but i should like to say on behalf of those who practise the law in scotland that to state that something which would be an offence in england should be an offence in scotland is an unsatisfactory way of proceeding <e> <s> it involves an inquiry by lawyers who are not accustomed to the law of england as to what the english offence is <e> <s> in borderline cases the issue is difficult to determine <e>"]
