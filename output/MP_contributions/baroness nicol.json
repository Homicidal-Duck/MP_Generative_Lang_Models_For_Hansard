["<cs> my lords you are all aware of the terrors that attend a maiden speech <e> <s> apart from the obvious difficulty of addressing such a distinguished audience there are the inhibitions which are laid down by our standing orders <e> <s> i must not be controversial <e> <s> it is difficult to think of any subject sufficiently important to be discussed in this house which would not be thought controversial by someone and especially following such a lively and fiery speech as that of my noble friend lady fisher who would incite anyone to controversy <e> <s> in addition the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure the house that if the government should go along the path of removing the right to strike it would be accompanied by protection for those workers involved in the wages field so that no worker as happens now in the health service can go home with less than the supplementary benefit rate <e>", "<cs> i accept that the noble lord lord bellwin speaks in good faith there is no question of that <e> <s> but i share the feeling which has been expressed so eloquently from all sides of this chamber that we really should make our feelings clear <e> <s> i am aware that there may be technicalities of drafting which need to be tidied up <e> <s> it is not my intention to place local authorities in the position of secretly nominating people to the water boards <e> <s> if a change in drafting is needed to avoid that such a change can be introduced at a later date <e> <s> but having come so far and having expressed its views so clearly i believe that the committee should now divide and give its view to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i speak in support of this amendment for this reason <e> <s> i have served on a very large number of committees of various sizes and kinds as chairman vice-chairman and practically everything else <e> <s> there is no doubt that when the chairman disappears for whatever reason but especially on a temporary basis it is necessary that the committee or body should have complete confidence in the person who is taking his place <e> <s> it seems to me that they are much more likely to have confidence in someone they have elected themselves than someone inflicted on them if the noble lord will forgive the phrase by the minister <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his remarks <e> <s> we will wait to hear from him <e>", "<cs> i have one small point to raise on clause to which the answer may be obvious to some <e> <s> it seems that under the new clause it will no longer be necessary for the secretary of state to make orders <e> <s> i am a little concerned that this may represent a diminution of control over the secretary of states powers <e> <s> i should like the noble lord the minister to comment on this if he will because i am not quite certain of the reason for this change <e>", "<cs> i am quoting from the explanatory and financial memorandum which draws attention to the fact that in clause whereas under the water act the minister had to make orders in order to appoint the authorities this is no longer required <e> <s> perhaps the minister would like more time to consider this point <e>", "<cs> it is not clear from the noble lords answer whether he had given thought to this point before today <e> <s> can i ask him again whether this actual point as put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon had been considered by him in those terms and whether he is making his answer in the full knowledge of what it implies <e> <s> this was not clear from the answer he gave <e>", "<cs> there is nothing unusual about the phrase that is suggested in the amendment <e> <s> it is used quite commonly as regards a large number of organisations and it is a protection for the organisation concerned <e> <s> there may be reasons for not accepting the lowest tender there may be reasons why it is considered unsatisfactory which they do not nececessarily want to discuss in public <e> <s> it is useful to have the inclusion of this protection to prevent argument that is unless there is to be selective tendering which would remove many of the dangers for them <e> <s> i cannot see why the government are resisting this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be a sensible business precaution to include it at the end as is done in so many places <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider part of my allotted time well spent in thanking the noble lord lord harvington because i think we have had a most useful discussion <e> <s> i hope that it will eventually have some effect although i was rather depressed to be told today that these debates are seldom taken up and used <e> <s> i hope that does not prove to be so in this case and that there will be some result from it <e>", "<cs> my lords coming to this scene i too was a little perturbed at the way in which a very <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please clarify something for me <e> <s> i find some of the answers a little confusing <e> <s> is it or is it not still the governments policy to restrict the number of students even at this time when and year-olds are at a peak <e> <s> if it is still their policy to restrict the number of students why are they claiming credit for the increased intake into polytechnics <e> <s> can we please have an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak out of turn by arrangement <e> <s> we have already heard so much about the evils of clause that i shall not attempt to rehearse them again since it has been done much more eloquently by other people <e> <s> however i should like to consider one aspect of it the one which the noble viscount has just been discussing and that is the particular danger to the provision made for disabled people <e> <s> your lordships may not be aware that many housing associations have formed integrated communities of disabled persons and able-bodied persons who are in some cases relatives of the disabled persons <e> <s> it is very important that these units should remain in the way in which they are so that the disabled persons can have support <e> <s> it follows that if only those houses which are adapted for wheelchair use cannot be sold sooner or later the others will go and little by little that community will be destroyed <e> <s> i find it very difficult to believe that the government intend this to happen <e> <s> i think it is probably another example of the effects of the bill not being properly thought through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for his reassurance but i should feel a lot happier if clause did not exist <e> <s> can we turn now to clause where i have one brief question to put to the minister <e> <s> this refers to the secretary of states power to obtain information <e> <s> i may be misreading this but when the minister replies will he please tell me whether the secretary of state will have the right to interfere between an employee and his employer and to get information <e> <s> it says in subsection in the last paragraph of section c <e>", "<cs> i too must apologise for missing the first part of this committee stage on tuesday <e> <s> i just want to make one point on the question of the building regulations <e> <s> i support the amendment which is being put forward for the reasons the noble lord lord swinfen gave <e> <s> i understand that consultations certainly with the association of district councils and no doubt with many other bodies began about a year ago <e> <s> in their very first reply the association of district councils drew attention to the fact that although they recognised that these regulations were overdue for revision they felt that any changes in respect of appointment of approved inspectors or any other major changes in the system should wait until the regulations had been finalised <e>", "<cs> subsection states that the secretary of state may approve just as subsection states that building regulations may prescribe <e> <s> if the may in each case became shall the clause would take on a completely different complexion <e> <s> it is the element of doubt left in subsections and which makes the amendment even more important <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the whole success of the bill from the governments point of <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment and to add one further point <e> <s> it is difficult to find words to put into this bill which would guarantee true independence <e> <s> how independent does someone become if he works continuously for the same developer or indeed for the same group of developers <e> <s> is it possible to spell this out in the bill <e> <s> is it the governments intention that this degree of independence should be obtained if possible and are they seeking words in which to spell it out <e>", "<cs> i raised this particular point at second reading and subsequently the minister very kindly wrote a letter to me and drew my attention to what he thought were the safeguards in this situation <e> <s> if i may i should like to quote from the letter <e>", "<cs> the minister kept referring to the trustworthiness of these bodies <e> <s> i am sure that they are trustworthy <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment was to ensure that they have the appropriate expertise <e> <s> i shall read with care the noble lords answer <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence to follow the economic industrial and political giants of this house among whom i number my noble friend lord gallacher who has made a most impressive maiden speech and i do congratulate him on it <e> <s> i think we may have had enough statistics for one day <e> <s> the situation has been described in great detail by a number of speakers and i do not propose to go over all that detail again <e> <s> we must admit that the million jobs lost since have not all gone under this government but this government must take the blame for accelerating the process by their blind pursuit of monetarist policies <e>", "<cs> my lords with your leave because my name does not appear on the list i should like to make a small intervention <e> <s> i will not detain your lordships long but as the noble earl lord ferrers has said under other circumstances there would have been considerable debate on this bill because it affects an important industry in this country <e> <s> it requires a mere per cent <e> <s> switch in trade from doorstep deliveries to supermarket deliveries of uht milk to bring about a cessation of doorstep deliveries in many places <e> <s> i am sure your lordships are well aware that quite apart from the financial consequences to the dairies in this country the social consequences of losing our doorstep deliveries are very great indeed because in many areas of the country and in many areas of population notably the old the doorstep delivery is their one daily link with the world outside <e>", "<cs> my lords the youth training scheme is welcome as i believe my noble friend lady david made clear at the beginning of her speech <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness opposite thought that we were being sour about it but it is our right and indeed our duty to criticise and to ask questions <e> <s> in that spirit i propose to offer some more questions to the noble earl which i think have so far not been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord byers for allowing us to have this debate today <e> <s> this subject has been debated here quite recently and no doubt it will be debated again in the near future <e> <s> but it is perhaps the greatest possible source of evil in this county and it is one to which we need to give all our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the noble lord lord alport for giving us the opportunity for this discussion although i regret it comes so late at night and that it will receive so little publicity because as previous speakers have said this was if your lordships will forgive the phrase a burning issue for a good deal of this summer <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answer we have been given may i ask the minister to say whether it is the governments intention to extend this principle to england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord teviot not only for raising this question so that we may discuss it tonight but also for his kind wishes to me as i am also grateful for the good wishes of my noble friend lord oram <e> <s> i am conscious of the honour that it is to stand and address your lordships from this place second only to the honour of being in your lordships house to begin with <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that in at least one area of the country the effect of the cuts on the magistrates court is that the police have been asked to reduce their input of cases to that court by per cent <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord further aware that the enforcement of arrears in that same area is almost at a standstill <e> <s> therefore the alternative to prison which is available to the magistrates has ceased to mean anything <e>", "<cs> my lords the global figures given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor are convincing but nevertheless the local interpretation is what matters in the application of law and order <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord therefore agree that if i write to him he will understand that i do not wish to name this area because it would be an invitation to crime in that area he will perhaps investigate this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is she aware that in cambridge city the figures given me by the city treasurer indicate that there will be a shortfall of about on the reimbursement which they expect to get from the government and that this will have to he met from the rates <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it this seemed to be a small uncontroversial and easy bill that would slide through the house this evening without too much being said about it <e> <s> however my noble friend lord graham and the noble lord lord kilmarnock have shown us very clearly the implications of the bill <e> <s> there are a few questions that i should still like to ask on which they have not touched <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood it eventually <e> <s> what i am saying is that to the ordinary man in the street it is quite incomprehensible <e>", "<cs> my lords since my name has been raised in connection with this matter i should like to put a question to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> the question which appears on the order paper is not entirely along the lines of that which i asked <e> <s> will the minister therefore reiterate that he is satisfied that expenditure on magistrates courts at the moment is achieving the purpose of the government in maintaining the quality of law and order to which we have become accustomed <e>", "<cs> my lords anxieties about the bill have now come from all sides of the house <e> <s> i shall try to avoid too much repetition but there are one or two points i should like to make <e> <s> first there is a provision in clause which gives the right to buy to tenants where the landlord does not own the freehold <e> <s> little has been said about this except by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> there are many occasions where housing associations have built on land leased from charities <e> <s> this happens most often in cathedral and university cities where much of the land belongs to the church to the university or to colleges all of which are charities <e> <s> these bodies need to preserve ownership of the land for their long-term use and so would not sell to developers or lease in circumstances where leasehold enfranchisement would jeopardise their future plans <e> <s> it has often been possible in the past for housing associations to obtain long leases from them on favourable terms because of the protection they could offer <e> <s> this has encouraged a supply of badly-needed rented accommodation in many city centres <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be an evening for credentials <e> <s> i cannot claim to be a farmer but i should say that i was brought up in a farming community and have had a good deal of first-hand experience of working on a farm <e> <s> secondly i live in cambridge which as many of your lordships will know was in a ring of fire for the whole of last summer or so it seemed <e> <s> it was probably only six or eight weeks but it seemed as if it was forever <e> <s> thirdly i am very concerned about the environmental aspects of this particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can tell you how to deal with unstable soils any more than i can give an answer to many of the other questions that have been asked about the alternative uses for straw <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord henderson unless we have the threat of a ban i do not think that research will be carried out as is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> on the question about licensing there seemed to be a feeling that as someone said and i <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly if you put planners in that would be so but i cannot imagine that a local authority would ask its planning authority to issue licences for agriculture <e> <s> i should think they would be perfectly capable of producing the right expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords i would expect it to be the county councils not district <e> <s> does the bill say otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this may be something which would have to be amended on committee <e> <s> i agree that many of the other points that have been brought up tonight are committee points and not suitable for debate at second reading <e> <s> with great respect i think that there will have to be some amendments and this might be one of them <e> <s> i am convinced that the expertise will be forthcoming <e> <s> it is most unlikely that a planner would be asked to issue licences for burning <e> <s> that covers licences i think which seemed to worry a great many people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to give way and to try to answer the noble lords question but may i point out that i am not the originator of this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord alport is the originator <e> <s> he will be summing up and i am quite sure that he can deal with any points that i have not covered <e> <s> i did not consult him before this debate so i do not know what was in his mind <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett raised a point about a residual power to burn straw in winter <e> <s> again that is something which could be raised in committee <e> <s> there will obviously have to be a sensible approach to used straw which is unfit for other purposes and i should be very surprised if this point could not be covered in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that two of the very clear recommendations in the report to which he referred are being taken seriously <e> <s> one is the need for more research and the other is the need for long-term funding in order to make more and better research available <e> <s> can he confirm that that has been discussed and that there is clear sympathy from the government towards this view <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the minister feels that he cannot meet this point <e> <s> we support this series of amendments and i should like to answer some of the points made by the minister <e> <s> the discussion on universities seems to be playing a leading part <e> <s> in terms of university development years is a fairly useless time and being able to safeguard a holding for that length of time is not a great deal of use <e> <s> as far as enfranchisement under the act is concerned i think we are talking about a very different kind of development nowadays <e> <s> that act came in as i am sure the minister will remember to deal with miners cottages where ex-miners or their widows were being turned out <e> <s> there were other things of that kind where the housing developments were fairly straightforward and clear to see <e>", "<cs> the minister now has a very good opportunity to undo what he feels was so wrongly done by the labour government <e>", "<cs> the minister has given us a great deal of information but he has not by any means <e>", "<cs> yes indeed that would he possible if there were enough of these dwellings <e> <s> but there are enormous waiting lists for them as the minister is well aware <e> <s> we are talking about a possible turnover of only a percentage of those dwellings <e> <s> the feeling of injustice that this provision will arouse is not to be lightly taken <e> <s> it may outstrip the size of what happens but it will create a feeling of injustice <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies may i deal with two points in one go <e> <s> first this is the first occasion on which the minister has even suggested that there was anything unsatisfactory in the application of building control up to this point <e> <s> in fact he is on record on two occasions at least as saying that building control has been carried out very satisfactorily by the local authority that was on the second reading of this bill and of the earlier one <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not bring the <e>", "<cs> the discussion has been fairly confusing for a number of noble lords <e> <s> the best course to adopt will be to read what has been said to look again at the bill and then to decide whether we wish to bring it back at a later stage <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know how to define a quango but since last may we seem to have become quite good at setting up quangos for other purposes <e> <s> perhaps the resistance to it is not quite as great as it was <e> <s> where will the money come from <e> <s> all the approved inspectors will be required to pay fees <e> <s> i do not know what level of fees will be set because they have yet to be prescribed in the famous word which occurs throughout the bill <e> <s> but that is one source of income <e> <s> one does not anticipate that the quango will be sitting permanently <e> <s> one assumes that it would be a body which met at irregular intervals whenever the need to approve or disapprove of new inspectors arose <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is quite right <e> <s> this seems to me to be a very ill thought-out scheme <e> <s> the minister raised one or two points <e> <s> first we welcome the fact that the government will look outside the professional institutions for other approved inspectors <e> <s> i apologise for pressing the point about arcuk but can the minister assure me that when they appoint representatives of the architectural profession they will not require members of arcuk necessarily to make their application through the riba <e> <s> will they be able to go straight to the secretary of state <e> <s> secondly the council of arcuk which made the decision that they would not wish to be one of the bodies to be consulted because they do not possess the machinery had a majority of members of the riba on the board and present at the meeting when the decision was made <e> <s> and it was not a unanimous decision <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take that into account when he makes his further investigations <e>", "<cs> i understand the ministers wish to bring the proceedings to a close but i really must protest <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention to pursue the matter much further <e> <s> however our view is that three matters of great importance are to be found in this part of the bill <e> <s> this happens to be one of them <e> <s> it is not our choosing that it is being considered at this time of night <e> <s> therefore we shall return to it at report stage <e> <s> i hope that the answers which the minister has promised will be received in good time before report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that very full xplanation and i am quite happy with it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes that is a reasonable answer up to a point but i still have a great deal of unease about the more complicated developments <e> <s> we keep talking about housing estates but these are not what we are worried about <e> <s> it is the much more complicated development the large mixed development of commercial and perhaps residential where large parts of the work can be covered up and certified before the local authority might have to step in <e> <s> i am not quite sure from anything that has been said whose liability it will be or how difficult it will be to prove liability in the event of a failure in these very complicated developments <e>", "<cs> i accept the explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble earl <e> <s> he has given some examples of older buildings where the standards leave a lot to be desired <e> <s> it is equally true that many modern buildings those built not only by local authorities but also for example by health authorities and many other statutory bodies fall short of the required standards <e> <s> i suspect that they do so not only in respect of building controls but in terms of planning as well <e> <s> i hope the day is not far distant when all public bodies will be subject to the same expectations as far as the public are concerned as are private builders <e> <s> in other words i hope they will be subject to building controls and also to planning controls <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will pursue this point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation and fascinated by the idea of having to consult the british bingo association <e> <s> i shall carefully study what the minister has said <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that we should be diverted by one particular example into belittling this whole issue <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to determine what is reasonable when the minister makes his decision <e> <s> at the moment it is left entirely to his <e>", "<cs> it is obvious that we have reached deadlock on this point <e> <s> i can only once more reflect that if the minister knows so well which authorities are involved if he is so sure of these authorities and if they are such streets and streets ahead of everybody else and in a class of their own it seems a little odd that we have to have this general legislation to deal with them <e> <s> i simply do not see why they could not have been dealt with either individually or in separate legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers reply <e> <s> it would meet many of the difficulties if when he is considering the situation he could be persuaded that it might be necessary for the secretary of state to give reasons for fixing a smaller determination as well as a larger one <e> <s> that to me was the sinister aspect of the matter the secretary of state is required to give reasons for determining a higher sum but not a lower one <e> <s> that course would overcome the difficulties <e> <s> however at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand the answer that i have been given but it does not really meet the point <e> <s> all three local authority associations have come to the same conclusion that the time suggested is too late <e> <s> however i should like to think that the minister would at least consider whether if st december is too early there might not be some time in between that would allow a little more flexibility <e> <s> at this stage i do not propose to press the amendment but i should like further time to think about it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the figures he has quoted include the figures for workers who have formed themselves into co-operatives <e> <s> if not are those figures available <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some disappointment that i view the considerable changes which have taken place in the bill during my absence <e> <s> let me first say on behalf of my noble friend lord john-mackie that he has to be elsewhere this evening and is extremely sorry not to be present <e>", "<cs> i still do not like the clause as it stands <e> <s> i should very much have preferred a better provision to be written into the bill to make sure that the secretary of state has to give better reasons for what he does and better guidance at the beginning <e> <s> however <e> <s> i can see that this amendment will not make any progress <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to concentrate particularly on the charitable aspect of the amendment of the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> there will always be to per cent <e> <s> of people in this country who will require rented accommodation <e> <s> this is not my view it is the view of one of our leading building societies which deals with private property and house sales all the time <e> <s> this is the level of rented accommo-dation which it feels will always be required <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to extend a very warm welcome to this bill and i congratulate the noble lord lord henley dare i say it <e> <s> in tandem with his honourable friend in another place on producing the bill <e> <s> i should like to explain quite briefly why it is a particularly welcome effort as far as i am concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that of the million hectares of our forest land in this country a mere hectares remain as broad-leaved <e> <s> does he recall that in the house of lords select committee on science and technology in a report on forestry stated that the decline should be halted and that no further reduction should be allowed <e> <s> can the noble lord say what action the government are taking other than making available grants for broad-leaved planting <e> <s> in particular what action are the government taking to improve the policy of the forestry commission in regard to planting broad-leaved areas that have been felled <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for that clear explanation of what is a complicated subject <e> <s> may i say that my noble friend lord john-mackie is extremely sorry not to be here <e> <s> he had an appointment which he had to keep and he has left me in his place <e> <s> we welcome warmly the changes in this scheme and i am particularly pleased on environmental grounds as i heard part of the discussion earlier this afternoon and it seems that there will be some possible environmental benefits from it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my intention to press the amendment but i must say that the minister puts a very plausible case <e> <s> however it does not accord with the wording of the bill <e> <s> the secretary of state will have the power once the redetermination is made to impose such requirements as he wishes and we are being asked to take on trust that he will not intervene to too great an extent in local authority affairs <e> <s> that is asking rather a lot in view of the history over the past two years or so in relation to local government <e> <s> however at this stage i shall not press the amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are talking about a different stage in the process <e> <s> i was talking about after the redetermination had been made <e> <s> the secretary of state should then publicise his reasons for the redetermination which is a different aspect of it <e> <s> does the noble minister wish to comment on that or was he aware of that aspect when i spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i have two queries on the compensation suggested in clause <e> <s> i appreciate that i have not given notice of this and i am quite prepared to wait for the answer but i feel that i must put the questions now <e>", "<cs> yes i thank the noble viscount <e> <s> it is not a complete answer but it goes some way and i will investigate a little more before the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour with so much said i shall try not to repeat any of the major points that have been made <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble earl lord onslow for bringing forward this debate <e> <s> it is particularly timely in view of the halvergate discussion that i too had come well briefed to cover <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for saving me the task of going through it all again <e> <s> i could perhaps say however that the reference by the minister in another place appears in column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon <e> <s> i failed to find this in spite of my search <e> <s> however my question still stands <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell us whether that too is working <e> <s> there is no need to say any more on the question of compensation so i should like to touch very briefly on part iii of the act which the noble lord lord winstanley mentioned <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down did i understand him to say that the acres at halvergate are in fact to be sacrificed on the grounds that they are peripheral and adjoin land which is already ploughed and that they are therefore not to be sold <e> <s> because does he not see that if that is so there will be a domino effect and they in turn will become the periphery of the next piece and that could be the end of the halvergate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for that reply and am very glad indeed to learn that the government have kept their promise in regard to local authorities <e> <s> is the minister aware that of those local authority members only five belong to district councils <e> <s> will the minister agree that the responsibilities of the district council are very much in line with the responsibilities of the water authorities and it is therefore very important that they should be represented <e> <s> when replacements are being made in future will he therefore ask that this imbalance should be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the total number of district councillors is greater than i thought <e> <s> but on the basis of my information from the adc does the minister not agree that there are five water authorities having no district council representa <e>", "<cs> my lords before coming to the few points which i feel i can make on this friday afternoon i should like to endorse what my noble friend lord bruce of donington has said <e> <s> it really is a great shame that a subject so important as this should be taken on a friday afternoon <e> <s> not only are we under pressure of time as has been shown by the arrival of the chief whip a short time ago who obviously is disturbed at the length of time we are taking over it but many people who are directly affected by the bill live in regions which make it impossible or very <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in the other place <e> <s> i have a number of questions which i must ask the minister <e> <s> first may i ask him whether he is referring to the acres which were under discussion in this house on th june <e> <s> if so it will come as a surprise to those of us who were present at that debate to find that the acres are still under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords reply so far as it went but he has still not answered my main question <e> <s> what action have the government taken to co-operate with the opposition in bringing forward an amendment to the act which will help to close the loopholes in it and which will prevent this kind of thing happening in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords before i begin i should like to make a small personal and probably unpopular observation <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of the speakers so far this afternoon have prefaced their contributions with the remark that they will not be here for the whole of this debate <e> <s> i feel free to say this since their number includes one of my noble friends this is very discourteous and it is a growing practice in your lordships house which i personally find most <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised to hear that response my lords <e> <s> i will now return to the subject of this debate and i will start by thanking my noble friend lord wells-pestell for introducing this subject which is one about which some of us feel very deeply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a direct link between the prison population and unemployment in the sense that the defendant in court is very often given a financial penalty rather than a custodial one if he has a job <e> <s> this is a qualification which is harder and harder to come by <e> <s> therefore the effect of unemployment on the prison population is very marked <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay the house but the minister has misunderstood my supplementary question <e> <s> is he aware that a custodial sentence is used for an unemployed defendant which would not necessarily be used for an employed defendant <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to dwell at length on the ministers reply <e> <s> he has my sympathy because he has a very difficult brief to execute on this particular bill but his answers were so full of contradictions and so unsatisfactory in total that i really must press the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i mention one other aspect of this sword which is hanging over the head of the cda <e> <s> the minister has said that the cda must throw off its shackles grow up go out into the great commercial world and get money from goodness knows where but wherever it goes to get money if the threat of instant disappearance is hanging over the head of the cda it will not get that money <e> <s> unless we can assure everybody who is likely either to give a grant to the cda or to go to it with a commercial undertaking that the cda will exist for at least six years they will not bother <e> <s> it is ridiculous to try to go forward with this <e>", "<cs> we are not talking about money going back to the taxpayer <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham was making the point that we are hoping against hope in view of the earlier discussions that we have had that there will be other money coming into the cda <e> <s> a lot of that money will come from cooperative sources or from grants from either here or abroad for co-operative purposes <e> <s> we have already said that we think that because of the shadow hanging over the future of the cda it may be difficult to get some of that money coming in <e> <s> it will perhaps be slightly less difficult if those sources can be assured that any of their money which is given for co-operative purposes and which is left over in the event of a dissolution will continue to be applied to co-operative purposes <e> <s> it seems a perfectly straightforward and honest thing to do <e> <s> if it is taxpayers money by all means put it in the consolidated fund but if there is a balance which can be identified as grants for cooperative purposes from co-operative sources there is no doubt about where it should go <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he realise that it conflicts with the reply given to the independent footwear retailers association in which his right honourable friend stated in response to a similar question <e>", "<cs> my lords when at present does come to an end will the minister make sure that childrens shoes above all else remain exempt from vat for as long as possible <e> <s> is the minister aware that not only would vat place a tremendous burden on parents who have to keep replacing shoes for young children as i am sure he is aware but also that the retailers association is very worried about the threat of cheap imports and the possible damage to young childrens feet caused both by passing shoes down the family and also by their being made to wear those shoes for too long <e> <s> will the minister promise that childrens shoes will be the very last to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for replying though scarcely for the reply <e> <s> is the minister aware of the difficulties being encountered by the nature conservancy council in its attempt to negotiate these reserves <e> <s> is he aware that its powers are really very inadequate for what it has to do and that it needs to have the assistance of the government particularly in its dealings with the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> will the minister undertake to attempt to strengthen the powers of the nature conservancy council or at least to give it some assistance in its negotiations with the maff <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the co-operation of all concerned is not forthcoming some further power will have to be taken <e> <s> i understand that certain of these negotiations have been held up by single individuals <e> <s> does the minister agree that that is not an acceptable situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong the debate but i should like to say for the benefit of those many noble lords present who were not present at the earlier stages of the bill that a lot of the amendments arose because the bill before us is an extension of the life of a body which has been in existence for some years has been doing a good job which the government have admitted on many occasions and indeed they have praised it for the job it has done and suddenly in this bill extending its life we find a whole range of new powers given to the minister <e> <s> they include although i do not want to dig it up again for too long the powers to dissolve the agency itself <e> <s> it seems to us on this side that there must be reasons for the new powers that are being taken <e> <s> we have failed to find satisfactory reasons for any of them though the minister has done his best to reassure us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong the debate <e> <s> the minister has done his best in a rather difficult situation <e> <s> i am reassured to hear that the agency is free to publish what it will in its annual report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord lord nugent for giving us the opportuniity once again to discuss this subject <e> <s> some of us remember the debate last november in which we all took part <e> <s> i sympathise very much with the noble lord in his local difficulty but i apologise i do not know the area and therefore cannot comment on the likely effects on it <e>", "<cs> my lords this must be one of the most important debates that we have had in this session touching as it does every aspect of human activity <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he please clarify whether he is suggesting that the abuses to which he referred took place in cities other than london <e> <s> frankly having regard to standing order no <e> <s> i shall try not to break it i am just a little tired of having discussions in this house on nothing but the glc <e> <s> i propose to talk about anything but the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful certainly i am very grateful to my noble friend for starting this debate <e> <s> at least i was very grateful until i realised that it was turning into a debate about abolition and yet again about the glc <e> <s> sometimes it is quite difficult to remember that this is the house of lords and not county hall <e> <s> since i first came here which i agree was not very long ago just a mere two years or so it seems that we have done nothing but talk about the glc <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear that my lords <e> <s> the fact remains that many of those people are puzzled by what they see as the vindictive attitude of central government <e> <s> the minister may claim that he has not been vindictive and that the government are not vindictive but that is how it is coming over in the town halls <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with almost everyone who has spoken so far in welcoming the bill but it must be a qualified welcome because as again almost everyone has said we have not seen the regulations and have no idea at all of what is going to be in them <e> <s> i shall return to that in a moment <e> <s> first i want to deal with one important omission from the bill <e> <s> that refers to the public right of access to information <e> <s> this was touched on briefly i think by my noble friend lord melchett but not in great detail by anyone else <e> <s> the royal commission on environmental protection in its seventh report in recommended a review of confidentiality arrangements and said <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister and in that case i shall withdraw the amendment in its present form <e>", "<cs> i confess still to a slight unease but i should like to read very carefully what has been said by all noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> may i take this opportunity to say that the document which i regret came too late today to be absorbed appears to be an excellent document <e> <s> at this point may also pay tribute to the notes on clauses which are extremely helpful clearly written and very full <e> <s> i thank the minister for them <e> <s> despite all that help i am still a little uneasy about this but at this stage i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure no one doubts the good intentions of the government but there will be extensive consultations and there will be pressures put on the government from some of those consulted <e> <s> it does seem to me that the word shall the imperative in the shall suggested by the noble earl refers to the making of the regulations as much as it does to the content of the regulations themselves and i see no reason why it should not go in as a clear declaration on the face of the bill of the governments intention that the regulations will go forward even if the date is unacceptable because by december the minister may feel that he is not in a position to make all the regulations that he will eventually wish to make <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies to that if it is the governments intention to take powers to deal with exports as soon as that becomes an international obligation what machinery will they use <e> <s> will it be done by regulation or by what means will they do it <e> <s> if in fact it is eventually to be done by regulation it would seem to me highly desirable from their point of view that this word export should be included now in the regulation so that when the time comes the machinery is to their hand <e> <s> i support very much what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that is a power the government should welcome if their intentions are really as good as they claim they are <e>", "<cs> the ministers remarks to my noble friend lord melchett are unworthy of him <e> <s> the question was put to him quite directly by several noble lords on his own side and he has not answered it <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow asked to be told in words of one syllable and so did the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i feel that the minister has really still not answered the question namely whether under the bill as it stands he can if necessary meet the particular international obligation which is likely to become necessary later this year which is prior informed consent <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers offering to think about it at this stage i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but i must say that it is something about <e>", "<cs> i understand the spirit in which the minister has made his offer and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will look i think she will see the amendment goes back to the very beginning of clause and it would in fact become paragraph <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment i wonder whether the minister would also clarify a point for me <e> <s> is he saying that in future volatility will be a consideration <e> <s> if so are the manufacturers aware of this <e> <s> from the information which i have it does not appear to have been a consideration in past tests <e> <s> it is very important that the situation should be made clear <e>", "<cs> if i were a manufacturer i would not be too happy about that particular reply <e> <s> we are getting back again to the yes or no situation <e> <s> is volatility to be taken into account or not <e> <s> is it a hazard which is to be measured or not <e>", "<cs> in order that the correspondence may take place and that i may read with some care in <e>", "<cs> can the minister give some idea of the priorities he will be observing not simply the total length of time involved but to which particular types of pesticide priority will be given <e> <s> what criteria will be used in that respect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> we must look again at the whole question of the involvement of the department of the environment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the reply and i note paragraph in the statement of intention with regard to the regulations which to a certain extent covers what the minister has said <e> <s> but i still feel we are being a little feeble in the sense that the government surely have a responsibility to see that the next stage on even if it is a bulk delivery is clearly labelled in the language of the country to which it is going <e> <s> the government need to discharge their responsibilities at least up to the receiving port wherever that may be <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister has said <e> <s> the wording of the amendment does not carry the intention which was that the packaging for more stringent conditions would be equally as good as the standards we apply in this country <e> <s> i shall have to find other wording <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> will the minister clarify this <e> <s> will he then have a statutory obligation to consult the acp on everything <e>", "<cs> in that case i should like to know why there is resistance to making it a statutory body <e> <s> what advantage is to be gained for the minister in making it a statutory body <e>", "<cs> this is about the third or fourth occasion on which i am left feeling puzzled by the reaction from the other side to what is apparently a reasonable amendment and appears to put into law what the government wish to do <e> <s> however i accept what the minister has said <e> <s> i suggest that public confidence would be greatly enhanced by having the acp as a statutory body <e> <s> that might perhaps weigh a little in the noble lords deliberations <e> <s> but at this point i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> relating to the species most at risk being golden eagle goshawk merlin and peregrine would the noble earl make a statement about the number of young that were captured during this year <e> <s> it is believed that the numbers were heavy <e> <s> is the minister aware that in the three years since that is and the total number of peregrines stolen was of goshawks and of merlins <e> <s> would he agree that this throws some doubt on the working of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the greatest threat is theft <e> <s> this is because the value of these birds on the market is extremely high <e> <s> in some cases it is many thousands of pounds <e> <s> can the minister make a statement on the level of fines imposed on those offenders who have so far been brought before the courts <e> <s> can he also tell us whether central records will be kept so that the secretary of state can measure whether the regulations need changing in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the financial guidelines to which the noble lord lord hunt referred are fundamental to the implementation of the bill and that there is widespread concern among local authorities conservation groups and the parks authorities about the operation of the present guidelines <e> <s> for example is the minister aware that suffolk county council have estimated that it would cost them between million and million to protect their vulnerable countryside under this act <e> <s> it is obviously beyond their means <e> <s> can the minister assure us that these guidelines will be looked at and that next time they will be put before parliament for scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the views of the industrial consumers as expressed by the cbi in november in which they quote the extra costs which will be falling on industry this year as a result of increased water charges for example for a paper-making company and for a pharmaceutical company <e> <s> this is based on a per cent <e> <s> rise which is modest <e> <s> is the minister able to explain to the house why we should not consider this to be a tax-gathering exercise one particularly without any democratic control <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the point about whether or not he considers this to be a tax-gathering exercise <e> <s> we have already seen tax gathering on electricity and on gas <e> <s> are we now seeing it on water <e> <s> he really has not answered this point <e> <s> will he comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in addition to the lead shot which may have been spattered round the grouse moors in the past year tons of lead in the form of lead shot have been left on the river banks <e> <s> is he aware that there is an appliance which will allow anglers to feed out one shot at a time from it <e> <s> does he not consider it worth while to encourage the use of this <e> <s> furthermore does the minister know that the figures for the deaths of swans from lead shot poisoning are ready available from the royal society for nature conservation <e> <s> the figures for the past three years are cygnets and older birds <e> <s> will he not agree that these are disgraceful figures <e> <s> will he therefore press the government to take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> b at the same time as remarking on the other two amendments <e> <s> first of all may i say how very pleased we on these benches are that the minister has come so far in meeting us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon i was quite carried away by the importance of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in essence the minister has reassured us that volatility is one of the applied tests and is a recognised hazard which they take into account <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what my noble friend says <e> <s> we do not mean to imply that we see anything sinister in the government amendment <e> <s> if we give what appears to be undue emphasis to this amendment it is because on the question of information to the public there is no more important part of this bill <e> <s> everything else that happens within it must take second place to the principle of freedom of information or as near to freedom of information as one can get <e> <s> that is why we have pushed this amendment rather hard <e> <s> however i see that nothing is to be gained by pushing it any further and i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be delighted not to move the amendment in our name which was put down before we had seen the government amendment which was in company with some others a bit late going in <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that the new committee is to be the acp <e> <s> that removes a long list of questions which i had been proposing to put to the minister on the composition and powers of the new committee <e> <s> one assumes and i hope it is right to assume that the powers of the acp will remain as they are <e> <s> although there may be just one or two residual questions which i should like to clear up i can but welcome very warmly indeed the proposal which the minister has made and the amendment which he has put forward <e> <s> i assume and i hope it is right to assume that the annual report which he promised will be published as we thought and that all the things which the committee did before will carry on as before <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will forgive another short intervention from this side of the house i ask whether if the minister finds the establishment of another committee unacceptable on grounds of expense or for any other reason he would consider establishing at either a university or a farming institute a research fund which might be able to do just what the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has suggested but perhaps in a cheaper way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the big exchange in committee took place on whether or not the bill gave power and one is now satisfied that that power exists be it under the act of by virtue of this amendment <e> <s> but the other remarks of the minister have to be disappointing for those of us who were concerned that we should wish to follow the policy of prior informed consent <e> <s> i know that there are difficulties <e> <s> i know that perhaps it is at this moment not a perfect way of doing things <e> <s> i know that there are many governments who might find difficulty in understanding the requirement and who therefore might not be capable of if you like getting full value from that particular agreement <e> <s> nevertheless i think it would have been greatly to our credit if we had taken an initiative on this line and not simply waited for international obligations to make us do it <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to rise once more and thank the minister not simply for this amendment but for his courtesy and helpfulness throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall an earlier question when he denied that the excessive charges being insisted upon this year were a tax gathering exercise <e> <s> does he not agree therefore that the point made by his noble friend lady gardner of parkes is relevant and that this charge should be called a tax <e> <s> also can the minister say whether he considers it good business practice that todays users should be paying for tomorrows consumers <e> <s> that is what is happening because capital schemes are being financed from the pockets of todays users <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl answers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure which the minister has given for waste to be dealt with include imported waste or was he speaking only of our home product <e> <s> if the figure includes imported waste what proportion represents such waste and what proportion represents as the noble earl called it a short-term hazard <e> <s> am i right in thinking that a short-term hazard in terms of radioactive waste really means a term of years <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up one point that the minister has made <e> <s> we support my noble friends bill and would like to see it go through <e> <s> the local authority time involved here surely is very small <e> <s> i do not agree that there is any doubt about who is to prepare the annual report <e> <s> it seems clear to me from the bill that it is the allotment societies themselves <e> <s> in most local authorities the kind of information that would be required is easily available <e> <s> it is simply a question of allowing access to the records which are clearly kept by most competent local authorities <e> <s> therefore i think that the objection raised by the noble lord the minister is not very useful <e>", "<cs> my lords there is just one question on these amendments that concerns amendment no <e> <s> refering to the schedule <e> <s> there is a change in that <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason that i did not rise earlier was that noble lords were doing such a splendid job that they did not seem to need help from me <e> <s> i support everything that has been said on the amendments but i take the point made on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that my co-signatories will be prepared not to move it <e> <s> it seems to me that the matter is well covered in the way that the noble lord lord renton said <e> <s> i support the feeling behind what has been said <e> <s> i am sure that the minister means what he says in his undertaking to have a suitable amendment put down in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the wording of the amendment does not find favour with the minister <e> <s> the intention of the amendment was certainly not that all pesticides should be subject to this control <e> <s> it is an enabling amendment in the terms of the bill <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very hard to follow that <e> <s> is the minister aware that in spite of the mirth which we have just all enjoyed this is a very serious question and that there are serious worries caused to members of the public by the problem <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that the discussions which are at present going on with local government about the means of dog control will be supported by the government and that when eventually the licence fees are increased the money that is available to local authorities will not count against the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> if i may mention the last point first i would say that the regulations are a long time a-coming and we have no clear idea of what will be in them <e> <s> if we could have a foretaste of what might be in the regulations it would be helpful <e> <s> however far from delaying the bill in order to take account of any consultations that are going on it has been suggested in the usual channels that in fact we hurry it through and that the interval between now and report stage should be reduced <e> <s> i mention that point for the information of my noble friend lord beswick who is concerned about the progress of the bill <e>", "<cs> the district valuer <e>", "<cs> before withdrawing the amendment which it is my intention so to do at this stage i should like to say that i do not consider that amendment no <e> <s> is entirely consequential on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i had meant to say that amendment no <e> <s> is not consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to press the minister beyond what i know he can say today <e> <s> i have however asked one or two questions to which i should <e>", "<cs> i look forward to receiving the letter from the minister on paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords you will not be surprised to learn that i support the intention behind lord alports bill as i have supported his earlier efforts <e> <s> it is questionable as to how much of the improvement which took place last year and there was an improvement was due to the weather becaue the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quoting from the report which undoubtedly expressed our need for paper pulp <e> <s> the government are looking for ways of creating what they call real jobs <e> <s> this seems an excellent way of doing so <e> <s> it seems to me that investment in this kind of industry would be good for the country in many ways in creating jobs and in service to the farming community which would help it to overcome this difficulty <e> <s> i believe that it is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the degree of dissatisfaction in port stanley with the state of repair of some of the civilian buildings both public and private <e> <s> will he accept that i have had a letter in the past week to that effect <e> <s> will he assure the house that at least part of the million will go to helping civilians to get back at least to their previous standard of living if not to a better standard <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the report to which the noble lord lord gridley referred in fact reached a different conclusion from that of the last speaker and that the findings of the report were that the grey seals do not cause significant damage to fishery interests <e> <s> is the minister aware of that <e> <s> is he further aware that man is taking care of the future of the grey seals because the habitat in which they breed is being so drastically reduced that in a very short time there will be no need to cull them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity briefly to thank the minister for the very helpful letter which he sent in response to a number of questions which i asked at committee stage and to say to the house and to those noble lords who have been taking an interest in the bill that the reason why we have not pursued our amendments at this stage is because i understand that a meeting is taking place in northampton on th march to try to overcome some of the problems which we raised at committee stage <e> <s> we are therefore holding our fire if i may use the phrase until we have the result of that meeting <e> <s> we shall then consider what steps we need to take at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might add in a very small voice at this point that i too got into some difficulty this morning and had to ring the ministers department which helped me out <e> <s> that is why i have not joined in the debate before now but it does seem to me that we are approaching a state where some consolidation of these acts would be a very good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not my intention to speak on the earlier amendments because i find that i cannot support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but perhaps he will answer one question when he rises at the end <e> <s> can he explain how if the officers in question are not to bring equipment onto the land they can fulfil subsection which gives them power to search and bore <e> <s> i do not think i know of any boring tool that could be carried in by hand and it seems to me that in the light of that power his suggestion of no equipment is not reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords although we have had some disagreements during the passage of the bill we welcome it <e> <s> in particular we welcome the enhanced powers of local authorities in relation to derelict land <e> <s> we on these benches are satisfied that the provision to protect landowners against excessive use of powers is adequate which is why with some regret i felt unable to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that the cuts inflicted by the des on the astronomy programme will not be of an order which would reduce the level of the research below what is reasonable <e> <s> can he assure the house that the substantial investment in telescopes both here and in <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my intention not to refer tonight to privatisation but in view of the bait that has been thrown out from so many previous speakers i will make some comment on it <e> <s> most speakers all but one i think have agreed that privatisation is not appropriate for this industry <e> <s> the noble lord lord craigton has made an interesting suggestion and i should like to study it a little more before making any comment on it <e> <s> but even the noble lord feels that straight privatisation is not a solution <e> <s> there has to be a fairly complicated superstructure in order to keep it in its right position <e> <s> we are very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord nugent for giving us the opportunity to discuss this at what i think is an appropriate moment because i hope that at the end of this there will be a very strong message back <e>", "<cs> i am relieved to hear that my noble friend does not intend to press this amendment because although i have the greatest sympathy with <e>", "<cs> that really was not an answer <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that the glc would not consult or that the borough on whose land the sssi is would not consult <e> <s> it would be helpful if we could have that cleared up <e>", "<cs> may i press this a little more <e> <s> if the answer to the question is that the whole of this site is in buckinghamshre with whom presumably the government are on reasonable terms is the noble lord saying that he has not attempted to discuss it with buckinghamshire or has he tried to and something has happened <e> <s> it really is not a terribly satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he confirm that the cages in which the clams are held will prevent the larvae escaping <e> <s> is he aware that if that happened it would be in contravention of section of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> can he assure the house that there is no chance that these clams can establish themselves in the wild <e>", "<cs> i will try not to cover any of the ground that has already been covered because i know that there is pressure on time today <e> <s> i am reminded of the justices clerks advice to his magistrates on the way into court be just if you can be merciful if you must but for heavens sake finish your list <e> <s> we did not finish our list on thursday and therefore we are under a little pressure today <e> <s> i will not be too specific about the issues which have been nobly covered by the noble lord lord chelwood and by my noble friend lord melchett in giving some excellent illustrations of the need for a county-wide planning body <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> we give it our full support <e> <s> i allow myself a little wry amusement at the intervention of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway who strains at the gnat of this tiny bit of intervention and has swallowed a hundred or so camels throughout the rest of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is a biblical reference which i am sure is familiar to your lordships <e> <s> we are concerned not with the powers of local authorities we are all satisfied that they have the powers it is the duty that we want to lay on them to take those powers <e> <s> the only way to do that and to persuade them that they can allocate some of their money many of them are hard pressed as we know they must be persuaded that some of that money must be allocated for this purpose is to have an undertaking from the minister that he means business <e> <s> to ask for this report is entirely reasonable <e> <s> it will be helpful not only to us and to those who care about conservation but also to the authorities themselves for it will give some idea of what is expected of them <e> <s> we fully support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to enter this very artistic argument but nevertheless i propose to bring noble lords all back to earth with a bump literally because i want to turn the committees attention to the parts of the two amendments which are concerned with parks national parks and the green belt <e> <s> recreation as enjoyed in the parks and in the open spaces of the metropolitan areas and the glc is as important as the arts to a very large number of people and i hope that it will be treated with the seriousness that it deserves <e> <s> i shall not keep your lordships long but i want to remind the minister of a discussion we had on clause which was i think on the third day of this seemingly endless committee stage <e> <s> concern was expressed from all sides of the committee about the fragmentation of responsibility in relation to parks and many of the arguments are not repeatable in the context of these particular amendments because they were concerned with the general expertise and the general upkeep of parks and open spaces <e>", "<cs> i do not know these boroughs i am not a londoner <e> <s> i am only pointing out the difficulties which could be encountered not only in relation to hampstead heath but elsewhere <e> <s> it may not be a matter of not speaking to each other <e> <s> there are different priorities in different boroughs <e> <s> some have more money for this kind of work than others some have more expertise <e> <s> to put this very important function into a situation of danger is really to create difficulties where none needs exist <e> <s> the amendment that we propose for the glc will do nothing to protect the body of expertise about which we were all so concerned when we dealt with the earlier amendment and we look to the minister to follow up the rather promising remarks that he made and to come forward with something that will meet that particular argument <e>", "<cs> i propose not to move this amendment in favour of amendment no <e> <s> kb <e>", "<cs> before turning to the other matters which i want to speak of may i say that the noble lord lord plummer and the noble lord lord kissin i think by a slip of the tongue both referred to a residuary body <e> <s> we are not discussing a residuary body we are discussing the establishment of a london parks authority which would be a permanent body for as long as it was needed to continue and not a temporary one <e>", "<cs> while the noble lords flow is interrupted may i make an intervention <e> <s> is he saying that when the grea is allocated the money will be earmarked for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with everyone else in welcoming this bill <e> <s> in fact i have seldom heard in this house such a chorus of approbation from all parts of the chamber <e> <s> i should like also to join with the house in congratulating my honourable friend and my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> if i have a quarrel with my noble friend it is that he has been so moderate today that i scarcely recognised him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to give the impression that i think that everything that the forestry commission has done lacks sensitivity or imagination <e> <s> indeed in many places it has applied both but there are too many where it has not <e> <s> if the noble lord can produce evidence that privatisation of forestry produces better conservation i shall be most interested to see it <e> <s> certainly i have had no evidence of that so far and i shall reserve my comments until such evidence is forthcoming <e> <s> i know that at the moment there is an instruction to the forestry commission to sell unproductive or uneconomic parcels of forestry <e> <s> i do not know what has happened to that whether such forestry is being sold or what effect that has had <e> <s> but i deplore the investment that is being encouraged in pockets of forestry by diverse people who have no interest in the effect of that forestry on its surroundings and are merely using it as an investment <e> <s> i cannot see that such a way of privatising forestry can lead to a better conservation approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> i did not refer to it as a field sport <e> <s> i meant sport in inverted commas which is how those who participate in it refer to it i regret to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his right honourable friend went further in november last year when he issued a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister on this and i do not wish to seem pedantic but there is a great difference between his original statement that the government attach great <e>", "<cs> my lords we too welcome and support the bill <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady carnegy for taking us through a rather difficult complicated few passages with great efficiency <e> <s> there is a hear hear from the noble baronesss front bench <e> <s> i too was glad to note that the bill had the support of the adc and of the ala <e> <s> the ala particularly were enthusiastic about it <e> <s> i wish that the adc had been a little warmer but i understand their position in that they will no doubt hope to persuade some of their members to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend and i join with him in hoping that mrs winter will completely recover from what must have been rather a dreadful ordeal <e> <s> it should not have happened particularly since we now understand that there may have been a similar previous occurrence <e> <s> it is very alarming that the previous incident was not followed up and its cause established <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> i have to confess that i do not dive <e>

firmly that it is essential to our wellbeing in perhaps more ways that we have thought that we should be putting much more enthusiasm and drive into bringing about marine reserves <e> <s> it is clear that if we are to make progress ministerial involvement is necessary <e> <s> that would be provided by the amendment <e> <s> the necessity as the noble earl lord peel has said has been illustrated by the events on lundy where maff was able to stimulate some action <e> <s> we should like to see that action repeated elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i have one more question i should like to put to the minister <e> <s> is he seriously suggesting that discussions have been going on for the last three or four years <e> <s> is he saying that negotiations started the moment the original bill became law <e> <s> is that a fact <e> <s> have they been discussing this matter or have we had only recent interest in marine reserves <e> <s> i think we need to know because if negotiations started four years ago i would respectfully suggest that we need not wait any longer <e> <s> if in fact the negotiations have only just begun perhaps he has a case <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just a few words in support of what the noble earl has said <e> <s> the wording of this amendment is based on the town and country planning act section and therefore should be acceptable <e> <s> i understand that the single clause bill which it is hoped will find its way here will be in much the same words <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether he will give an assurance that if the single clause bill is produced the government will speed its passage <e> <s> i understand that it had its first reading on monday <e> <s> if he will give us that assurance i am sure that we shall be prepared to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> we thought it necessary to put this duty on agriculture ministers in regard to sssis and areas of natural beauty national parks <e> <s> that would seem to me to indicate that we felt that the general duty which we would expect them to perform was not sufficient in those cases <e> <s> when we consider that those areas which are subject to special protection are such a very small part of the countryside however important they may be i think we realise that if we are to make any impact on maintaining the beauty of our countryside which we all wish to do we have to put the duty on ministers generally to protect the countryside in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> will he assure the house that the standards which are now to be applied hopefully in the norman shaw building will also be applied throughout the palace of westminster <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the noble baroness and perhaps a comfort to those who are yet to speak to know that we do not oppose any of these amendments <e> <s> we accept that they are necessary either as drafting amendments or to cover a point which was not properly covered in the bill and none of them will be opposed <e> <s> i should just like to say that i find it a little disconcerting that a bill which has been heavily amended at every stage a very small bill to begin with should still be being heavily amended when it reaches this house <e> <s> i understand that the government supported the bill from the beginning and i find it a little strange that better help was not given in the drafting at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the house will forgive me if i rise and keep your lordships for a very short time simply to say how very glad we are to see this bill finally on its way <e> <s> if i may be forgiven for introducing a slightly sour note i should like to say how much better it would have been if the clauses which were approved at second reading in the other place had been allowed to remain in the bill especially those on marine reserves forestry and the duties of agricultural ministers <e> <s> the last one in particular received wide support from all sides of the house and from outside bodies which are concerned with farming interests <e> <s> it is very difficult to understand why the government insisted on removing this particular clause <e> <s> public opinion demands it and sooner or later it must come <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome these amendments and can see the argument for having a consistency of approach as far as the data protection act is concerned <e> <s> however i have a slight worry about the application of the amendments which i should like to put in the form of a question to the noble baroness who may be able to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but i must say that i am a little sorry that he cannot be more forthcoming <e> <s> does he not consider that an extension of section of the wildlife and countryside act which allows for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister on this matter but to refer to overall legislation as a scattergun approach is not terribly appropriate <e> <s> we have general legislaton for the control of pollution <e> <s> it seems entirely reasonable that we should have general legislation for taking care of conservation in newly privatised industries <e> <s> will the minister not at least say that the government will have a concern for this and will do their best to ensure that the concerns of conservation are pursued in any privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the greatest polluter of the mersey is not manchester or liverpool but ellesmere port <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the link between research of this kind and the use of pesticides <e> <s> does he know that if there is a break in the necessarily continuous programme of research into diseases of crops and into the understanding of insects there will inevitably be an increase in the use of pesticides <e> <s> is he aware that this would have a most unfortunate environmental effect <e> <s> is he sure that the priorities board is fully aware of this and will take it into consideration during its discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the reason for the ministers assumption that there is no need for a licence is that he believes that the shellfish cannot breed in our waters <e> <s> i believe that that is the answer he gave to me on an earlier occasion <e> <s> is he aware that at least two species of clam have adapted to breed in the lower temperatures of our coastal waters <e> <s> this clearly shows that there should have been a licence under the act <e> <s> can he say whether the ncc has been consulted in any of the cases to which he refers and does he not agree that it should be consulted in the future if it has not been <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like particularly to welcome this group of amendments <e> <s> we had a considerable amount of discussion on the responsibilities of officers during the passage of the bill in this house <e> <s> it gave rise to anxiety and we are grateful for the clarification that has now come <e> <s> we welcome the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords we also welcome these amendments <e> <s> i think that i am probably right in saying that this would in the interim before the final signature to the convention cover any deposits in fissures in the sea-bed about which there might perhaps have been an argument as to whether they were on the sea-bed or under it <e> <s> but certainly we also welcome these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to welcome particularly this amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in it the minister is honouring a commitment which the noble lord made i think at the committee stage of the bill in this house originally to find a proper wording which would set out clearly the objectives of clause which was the clause about which we were all most concerned <e> <s> i think that the wording that has been chosen is admirable and i congratulate those who have devised it <e> <s> it covers i think all the objections that we had to the original clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain the house unnecessarily but i feel that again i must express our pleasure at the inclusion of this amendment which was as the minister said very warmly discussed here <e> <s> we feel very deeply about it and we are very grateful indeed that it has been included <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little worried about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> having welcomed the idea of continuous monitoring continuous research and continuous observation of everything that goes on in this field and having touched very briefly on the funding of it we now come to a point where it might be considered that those who are either manufacturing or using or both the substances in question might be asked to pay for the entire service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister or whoever was responsible for this amendment <e> <s> this was a matter of concern which we discussed at the very beginning of the bill and it is very helpful to have it cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that although as he said in answer to my noble friend last week the thorpe report may be a little out of date the need for allotments and pressure from the government to keep allotments going is more needed now than it ever has been <e> <s> does he not see that because of the high numbers of unemployed in this country and because houses are now being built without gardens for these two reasons if for no other the government really should be putting some pressure and some thought behind this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the report that all planning controls are to be abandoned in some areas <e> <s> will he remember that one mans expansion of industry is another mans nuisance and that to abandon planning controls completely might defeat the very objectives which the government are trying to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords the persistence of my noble friend is admirable in the circumstances <e> <s> having had a couple of days in which to cogitate on the last time he was asked a question on this subject will the minister now tell us how the government are proposing to break out of this deadlock <e> <s> the noble lord says on behalf of the government that without proof of pressure of need for allotments the government cannot take action and yet they will not take action to get the proof <e> <s> it seems to me that we are in a difficult and ridiculous situation because my noble friend has proved that there is a great need for something to be done <e> <s> has the minister decided what course of action the government can take <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> i am sure he will have a large postbag in the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend on presenting this second small amendment to the wildlife and countryside act and my honourable friend in the other place for having the good fortune to be able to bring it forward in time to get it through this session <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said i should like to concentrate a little on the environmental side of the regulations <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandford for covering a number of the points that i would have wished to make <e> <s> my welcome for that is what it is is a little more qualified than his <e> <s> i think that there are gaps which need to be filled <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will not take very seriously the questions which have been put to him but dismisses them as speculation then will he take seriously the report of the national chairman of the young conservatives who has in conjunction with the construction federation said that we have million houses which are substandard unfit for habitation or lacking basic amenities <e> <s> he has called on the government to do something about that situation <e> <s> will the government not take that request seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the blood presently in stock and taken from donors before these new regulations came into force is being screened before use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now a little confused about the answer to my supplementary question which the noble baroness first gave to me and i am sorry to press her on this matter on the occasion of her birthday <e> <s> it is not clear to me it may be my own lack of technical knowledge whether we can be absolutely certain that every blood transfusion of any kind now given is made with blood which is safe <e> <s> is this heat treatment applied at the time of the making of the plasma or before it is turned into whatever is used in the transfusion <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall the words of his noble predecessor on rd october last year when he said in relation to oil and gas exploration which we were discussing at the time that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too offer the minister sympathy in advance because i am about to introduce yet another facet although i have tried not to put my remarks in the form of questions so he may get away with not spending too long on my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i happily associate myself with the laymen on the committee <e> <s> the standard of debate tonight has been extremely high and i hope that the minister will be able to take a lot of new ideas back <e> <s> first of all may i join in the remarks about the noble lord lord ashby <e> <s> it is very sad indeed that he is not here with us this evening <e> <s> i am sure that we all send him our good wishes and hope that he will be back with us soon <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the figure he has given includes voluntary premature retirement which is a euphemism for further redundancies <e> <s> is the minister aware that such redundancies are particularly destructive because they mean that people who are very valuable to the industry are leaving while they can still get a job elsewhere and that the head of the department does not necessarily have any choice about stopping them <e> <s> are they included in the figure which the noble earl has given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the reply he gave to the noble earl lord halsbury could be amplified a little <e> <s> what matters is the destruction of a team <e> <s> the fact that the people involved are distributed among the private sector does not help matters <e> <s> does the minister not appreciate that it is the destruction of a particular team that is so devastating to the plant breeding institute in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is to be congratulated not only on giving us the opportunity to debate this subject today but also on his masterly speech in introducing it <e> <s> i agree with almost everything that he said <e> <s> i am only sorry that i cannot take his particular arguments a little further <e> <s> i want to cover an aspect of privatisation that he did not mention the effect on the environment of certain privatisation measures <e> <s> the effect of the privatisation of certain industries on the environment could be very dramatic <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that earlier this year the plant breeding institute was given the impression that he was awaiting a report from the priorities board due to be published at the end of the summer so that he could resolve some of the uncertainties <e> <s> can he say whether the board has reported and if so whether the report is available for outside scrutiny <e> <s> if not will he tell us what decisions he has made as a result of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords as each hour has passed i have crossed out more and more of what i planned to say <e> <s> however i think i must say the little which is left <e> <s> there is no doubt of the need for a bypass <e> <s> we have all agreed on that and i am surprised that noble lords have felt it necessary to go on saying so <e> <s> there is no argument okehampton must have its bypass <e> <s> i do not intend to go over again all the arguments between north and south <e> <s> i have just a few particular points that i want to make <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us a little more information about the european effort to which he has referred <e> <s> does he agree that an international effort is needed and that up to now britain has appeared not to co-operate to the extent that many of our friends feel that we are not be be relied upon in this particular area <e> <s> the latest example of this is the norwegian statement this morning that relations between our country and theirs are now at their worst since the viking invasion <e> <s> it would be a great relief to all of us to know that there is a truly international effort <e> <s> can the noble lord please spell it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister has misunderstood my question <e> <s> what international effort are we making <e> <s> the minister refers to our research efforts but what co-operation are we giving to other international research <e> <s> are we working with them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for explaining the order in such a clear way <e> <s> we welcome the provisions contained in it <e> <s> dare we hope that the other measures which are to follow are those which need to be taken if we are to move positively towards better control of oil pollution around our shores <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome this bill and i personally should like to thank the noble lord lord walston for his very clear explanation of it <e> <s> as he says it is a fairly short bill nevertheless i could wish that in it there was one other provision which i shall now propose to outline <e> <s> i am sorry that the opportunity has not been taken to look at the maximum fines which are imposed in the act <e> <s> your lordships will notice that there is a maximum fine of for a number of the offences which are mentioned in that act including section which is the one that we are

example the after-tax profits of esso in were million and in they were million <e> <s> i am not suggesting that esso would break any rules but your lordships can see the order of magnitude that the fine would need to be now in order to keep pace with that increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble earl does not feel that he can press the matter of a fine <e> <s> on a quick calculation comparing the level of the fine with what is was it should now be about million if was correct in <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e> <s> magistrates courts may not yet have seen fit to impose the maximum fine <e> <s> speaking as a magistrate i can say that that often happens in a magistrates court <e> <s> but if the maximum is higher the level of fines goes up <e> <s> we must keep up the pressure and i hope that the noble lord lord walston will consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that none of these new projects will go through a national park

that million represents an increase over previous years and in view of his own remarks in the introduction to his excellent report in july can he say whether there is any intention to step up research

outlet for surplus straw <e> <s> this is being done very successfully i understand in at least two places on the continent <e> <s> one is in italy and i think the other is in denmark <e> <s> this would be a very useful exercise not only in terms of using surplus straw but also as an answer to unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that not unexpected reply <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister give us some idea of what the hold-up is at the moment <e> <s> for nearly four years now

something more fundamental than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the minister a little further <e> <s> my understanding is that the suspicions of which he spoke have largely been laid to rest and that fishery interests have now come round to the idea of supporting the provisions in the legislation <e> <s> in fact as i understand it what is holding the matter up is a quibble over a by-law between the doe and the maff <e> <s> is the problem bureaucracy or can this matter be sorted out <e> <s> it seems quite wrong that we are being held up because of such a small matter <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will forgive me i am trying to understand his point of view <e> <s> the minister refers to millions of workers who already work on sunday <e> <s> i should like to know who are

of view <e> <s> we are talking about shopworkers who for a variety of traditional and historic reasons do not have strong union representation <e> <s> will the minister please tell me who these millions are <e> <s> will the noble lord also tell me if he can understand the difficulty which shopworkers are in because they are so fragmented <e> <s> i do not think that this point has been spelt out often enough <e> <s> they work in small units <e> <s> there is a difficulty in organising them <e> <s> who are these other millions who are comparable with the shopworkers <e>", "<cs> i have the best possible reason for saying that people do not want to work on sundays <e> <s> up to last year i spent eight years on the board of a large co-operative society and for the last four years i was its president <e> <s> we had the greatest difficulty in recruiting what i might call career staff people who want to make a career in retailing <e> <s> let us face it these are the people on whom we

experience to be enjoyed unless the quality of people running and working in the shops is up to standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the committee on its excellent informative report and the noble earl lord cranbrook on the way in which he presented it <e> <s> i want to confine my own remarks to the matter of waste disposal which is something that has not been discussed a great deal today and is something about which i am very concerned because of its environmental impact <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if metering becomes the norm families

society for the prevention of cruelty to animals are in principle both against the suggested by-law of the anglian water authority which is considerably less stringent than the maff by-law and that even the maff by-law does not come up to the standards which they require <e> <s> does the minister agree that this problem has gone on long enough and that action should now be taken to go ahead and bring in legislation especially since one has been told that very good non-toxic substitutes have been successfully used in competition <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the fact that discussions have taken place <e> <s> my understanding is that when maff produced its bylaw it did so with little or no discussion and indeed that one of the difficulties both for anglers and for the others concerned was that maff apparently produced its by-law out of the blue without any discussion <e> <s> can he comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister but i am disappointed in that reply <e> <s> is the minister aware that in the noble earl lord gowrie and as late as september the right honourable minister in another place reassured sadlers wells by saying that the glc allocation to it had been taken into account when giving the extra money to the arts council <e> <s> are we now to understand that those ministerial reassurances are meaningless because that is what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel that the minister dealt clearly with my remark about ministerial reassurances <e> <s> there is no doubt that the sadlers wells theatre company was clearly told that its needs were taken into account in the grant which had been made <e> <s> what

something like a week and that this can mean life or death to a man with a family <e> <s> have the government any plans in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord john-mackie for giving us the opportunity to discuss this subject if only to learn that it is possible to make the noble lord lord elton chase hares <e> <s> i have been trying to do it for months without any success at all <e>", "<cs> before i go on to my main remarks on a more serious note my lords i wonder whether i might make it clear that when i refer to planning considerations i agree with my noble friend lord john-mackie that unreasonable planning controls are not acceptable and that an unreasonable time taken for planning controls is not acceptable <e> <s> it is something which i think we have all been working to eliminate and indeed some progress has been made in the last few years <e> <s> we must see that that progress continues because as i hope to show later on i think we have a need for planning controls <e> <s> but they should not interfere with the livelihood of people particularly with that of the farmer and he should not be unduly held up by them <e>", "<cs> my lords if only to protect other farmers from the expense of having to knock down buildings they do not like i think we shall have to reach the stage where there is some planning control over farm buildings <e> <s> but that does not interfere with tonights debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i will make my own position clear as i go along <e> <s> may i first say that because i felt that i needed to know more about the up-to-date situation i consulted with the national farmers union with the countryside commission with serplan with the town and country planning association and to a lesser extent with the conservancy council <e> <s> it seemed to me that it was necessary to get a few outside views on what we were discussing tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> as is indicated by the wording of the statement it is recognised that the question of suitability of the site is only part of the problem and that the real difficulty is public confidence <e> <s> will the minister agree that public confidence has been considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not ask about compensation <e> <s> i asked whether the noble lord was aware that planning blight could be caused and if it became obvious that one or more of those sites was obviously impossible before the end of the investigation could the public be told so that any blight was lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to say how much his ministry has relied upon the results of the monitoring undertaken by this committee <e> <s> if the ministry has found it necessary to use the results will it not consider increasing the frequency of its own monitoring to try to fill the gap that will inevitably be left <e> <s> is the minister aware that we are not just talking about liverpool bay this particular committee covers the whole of the west coast of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and am glad to hear that there has been limited consultation <e> <s> does the noble lord not think that in view of the importance of this particular issue it would have been more appropriate to have a green paper on the subject <e> <s> is he aware that in the first paragraph of professor littlechilds report he draws attention to the fact that he specifically does not cover the matter <e> <s> does that not in itself mean that perhaps more importance should be given to it than the government are giving <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i fully understand the answer which i have been given <e> <s> my understanding was that self-employed people who are not in employment could not claim benefit <e> <s> if this is not so my whole question is based on an incorrect premise <e> <s> will the minister correct me before i go further <e>", "<cs> my lords i was simply clarifying the ministers reply to my original question <e> <s> the minister will recall no doubt that on th february when we last discussed these statistics he was very emphatic about the need to have accuracy in the figures and he said that self-employed people from now on were to be counted in the interests of accuracy <e> <s> therefore i am not quite clear how he redresses the balance on this particular calculation <e> <s> if self-employed people are now to be included in the numbers of those employed and are therefore to affect the percentage of employed is he satisfied that the present system properly reflects those who are out of work bearing in mind the fact that employers now expect so many tradesmen to become self-employed before they will take them on <e> <s> i think the figure is being distorted <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure the house that considerations other than commercial ones are being taken into account <e> <s> that did not seem very clear from his answer <e> <s> in particular will he give a categorical assurance that so far as the pbi is concerned the enhanced commercial value of its present site is not a factor in curtailing its operations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the possible enhanced value of the pbi site at the moment a factor in reducing its operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for replying though i find that answer rather disappointing <e> <s> does the minister recall that when the royal commission on environmental pollution in its eleventh report drew attention to the shortcomings of national health service kitchens it also drew attention to the shortcomings of national health service incinerators <e> <s> will she not agree that it seems unreasonable that their standards should be allowed to be any lower than those for other incinerators <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there is a new dimension now in the waste disposal problem from national health service establishments <e> <s> it is that under pressure from the government to commercialise operations i understand that some authorities are contemplating offering a service to local industries to dispose of their noxious waste in their incinerators <e> <s> as this would patently be unfair would not the noble baroness agree that this would at the very least cause unfair competition with other disposers in the neighbourhood as well as being an added risk to health if crown immunity is allowed to remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to look at the subject as your lordships will probably expect from the point of view of environmental conservation and to look particularly at the effect of afforestation on wildlife and the need to plan and manage forestry in an environmentally sympathetic way <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains for me to thank everyone who has spoken in the debate <e> <s> we have heard some well informed and thoughtful comments <e> <s> the minister has answered the debate with his usual charm and courtesy <e> <s> i must say however that there is little comfort in some of his remarks for those directors of institutes who are trying to see their way ahead <e> <s> in spite of some of the encouraging things the minister had to say about funding we are left in some doubt about the governments own attitude to their prime responsibility <e> <s> i hope that this can be answered on another day <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords can we take it from the ministers apparently sympathetic reply to my noble friends supplementary question that the treasury veto which is to be written on to the face of the bill will not be applied at least until the million or million has been spent <e>", "<cs> my lords let me set the ministers mind at rest immediately there will not be a third front bench speech <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord for his reply and to say simply that in the last few minutes he has made it obvious to me that there is a long way to go in this debate and that there will be another opportunity i should like to think that there will not be but i fear that there will in the autumn to consider this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that this is an organisation with a unique data base which is london-wide and that it is used by many established agencies voluntary and otherwise as well as ordinary londoners <e> <s> does he not feel that as the government were responsible for the uncertainty which the centre is now suffering they have some responsibility to ensure that this very valuable work continues <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government any plans to help beekeepers with the price of sugar for their winter feeding <e> <s> i understand that they are having to pay a ton which is the ec price whereas the world price for sugar is a ton <e> <s> is there any way in which they can be helped during the winter months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene <e> <s> i wanted simply to remind the noble lord and the house that we are at the report stage and i think it would be better if we confined ourselves to one speech <e>", "<cs> i find this quite confusing because it seems to me that the noble lord lord sandford and my noble friend lord melchett specifically asked about keeping a duty <e> <s> then we heard a long and very interesting speech about charges which presumably we shall have to hear again when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we still have not received an answer to the point about duty <e> <s> can the noble lord lord belstead give us that answer and then perhaps later we can deal with the charges point on which we are all hoping to comment <e>", "<cs> if it was possible to separate the functions in the way that the noble lord describes there would be an even greater danger that adas would not be on the farm in the first place <e> <s> if the farmer has to decide about advice and is offered free advice by commercial companies wanting to sell their products the adas man will not be there <e> <s> much of the conservation advice given in the past has been incidental advice to the more technical advice that adas was called in to give <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does not the minister recall that one of the great difficulties during the okehampton controversy was the worry about delay because the ministry had gone ahead with working up that road and had not worked up alternatives <e> <s> does not the minister consider that clearer instructions should be issued about roads in national parks to prevent the same thing happening again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister further but there is a very strong rumour circulating at the moment that the cbi is trying to revive the motorway through the peak district <e> <s> does the minister know whether that is so <e> <s> is he able to confirm whether the department is working on that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the motorway between manchester and sheffield i think it is called the longdendale road <e> <s> it is a road which has been rejected in the past but the rumour that it is to be revived is strong <e> <s> can the minister give an answer in that respect <e>", "<cs> i support both amendments but particularly no <e> <s> <e> <s> it will help the farmer <e> <s> the vast majority of people who go into the countryside to walk use public rights of way <e> <s> it is entirely in the interests of <e>", "<cs> the amendment does not say what the noble lord suggests <e> <s> it refers to established rights of way and the need to keep them unobstructed and clearly marked <e> <s> that is entirely sensible <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and to quote one small example which i came across only this afternoon when i was reading the governments deregulation proposals which have just been published <e> <s> in the planning chapter i regret i do not have the document with me to quote chapter and verse the government refer to the need to maintain planning controls in environmentally sensitive areas <e> <s> they obviously do not mean esas with capital letters <e> <s> to continue with this phrase unless it is required by the community legislation perhaps the minister will tell us that will only lead to utter confusion in the end <e> <s> i support very much the idea of conservation farming a suggestion which i think came from the cpre <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment and to make one point and only one which the noble lord lord buxton has not made <e> <s> we have just had a discussion on an earlier amendment about how very carefully these areas are to be chosen <e> <s> we had an argument about the fact that they have to be particularly desirable and this will be the combined opinion of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food the nature conservancy council and the countryside commissions <e> <s> after all these bodies with their great expertise have decided that such an area is worthy of designation it then seems quite wrong that the treasury should apparently just be able to say sorry you cant have it <e> <s> i am sure that that is not what is intended by the bill and i hope that the minister will spell out what is intended and tell us very clearly why this phrase cannot be left out <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord is about to withdraw his amendment but i should like to ask one more question before he does so <e> <s> i am not quite sure that i fully grasped the import of some of the things the noble lord said <e> <s> may we come at it another way <e> <s> what could the treasury not do that it can now do or what is there that it would want to do that it would be prevented from doing if we remove this clause from the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a final point <e> <s> i have said it all before but it seems to me that if we leave this in as it is it may be perfectly all right with the present minister or even with one or two subsequent ministers but the day may come when the clause could be abused <e> <s> as it stands at the moment it means that the treasury could exercise a veto <e> <s> it may not be the intention but certainly that is how it reads <e> <s> for that reason i hope that the minister will think again about taking it out <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary to say that this has been a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> i think that perhaps this evening the clich is actually true <e> <s> we have ranged from inner cities to cornish landscapes and back again <e> <s> i must thank my noble friend for giving us this opportunity because many of the things that we are discussing tonight loom very large in peoples minds and another opportunity to discuss them is very welcome indeed <e> <s> perhaps i may also add my compliments to the right reverend prelate on his maiden speech which was excellent <e> <s> i think that it is an interesting reflection on the state of mankinds minds that when he described as the height of privilege an absolutely empty landscape there was a murmur of approval all round the house <e> <s> i think that it is rather sad that we should have reached the stage where to get <e>", "<cs> i am almost reassured but i should like to clear up one or two points <e> <s> are there any circumstances in which a retrospective grant might be applied for <e> <s> there might then be a danger of work being done which would not normally have been approved <e> <s> also is it not so that there will be some esas that are outside national parks and areas with other protections <e> <s> would it not therefore be sensible to have this other layer of protection in those cases <e>", "<cs> i accept the answer which the minister has given <e> <s> i look forward to reading his reply with care and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps we may get amendment no <e> <s> out of the way first and then return briefly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am more than happy to accept the ministers assurance on amendment no <e> <s> and beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i think we must all do more thinking before we come to the report stage <e> <s> i am reassured to a large extent by what the minister said but i should like to consider more carefully the suggestions he made <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the late hour i should like to make two quick points <e> <s> the minister referred earlier to the damage that could not be controlled if a grant was not applied for <e> <s> there is no way of stopping this at the moment <e> <s> i understand that a landscape order such as we are discussing would control it and for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that there was collaboration on the question of acid rain <e> <s> does he mean collaboration with other european countries and can he tell us to what extent this collaboration has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to emphasise that we are talking about landscape conservation orders and not areas <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships for the difficulty that has been caused <e> <s> it was not the fault of the office <e> <s> there was a small upset on the way to the office and that is why the printing has come out as it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not moved by the fact that there is no labour administration precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the amendment which meets the monitoring point about which we were so concerned <e> <s> i look forward to the first published information <e> <s> we can then decide whether what the minister considers appropriate is what we also consider appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure the house that the level of support for the natural environment research council is sufficient to deal with what research can be done in this country <e> <s> for example is he aware that at the moment there is no director of atmospheric research <e> <s> has he any comments to make on that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and i am sure that someone will get him off the hook before the end of this question <e> <s> will he accept that we support him in his praise for the lead development association <e> <s> it is public-spirited and i am sure that it will be helpful <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the house whether the proposed by-laws have been used by water authorities to ban the use of lead shot <e> <s> can he also tell us whether a non-toxic alternative for dust shot has yet been developed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he mean that all anti-fouling paints which contain even small amounts of organotin will be included <e> <s> is he aware that this substance accumulates in the food chain and is causing a number of bird deaths and they are birds protected under the berne convention <e> <s> is in fact the whole range of anti-fouling paints included or just a specified few <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply is disappointing in one respect <e> <s> july is after the main boat-painting season and that means in effect that we shall possibly have a further year of the wrong kind of paints being used <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that squid and fin fish are being fished up to the limit of sustainable yield and that urgent action is necessary <e> <s> is she aware that it is not possible to go on waiting <e> <s> will the minister not consider that a straight-forward licensing system could be applied <e> <s> is she aware that the poles and the japanese would certainly find this acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl assure the house that in view of sir francis pembertons recent decision not to renew the lease on his acres of the pbi site because he wanted it for commercial development the new owners will be asked to give an undertaking that their part of the site will not be sold for commercial development <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to confine myself to part ii of the bill regarding the simplified planning zones <e> <s> at first sight the concept of the spzs seems a useful addition to the tools of a local planning authority <e> <s> clause sets out the framework for the creation of spzs and their subsequent management and termination in reasonably clear and unexceptional terms <e> <s> but we agree with the noble baroness lady stedman that the time allowed namely years for what is an untried scheme is too long <e> <s> we too will be returning to that in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps he will understand if i do not wish him complete success but i wish him well <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it is a little disappointing if the government are going to concentrate simply upon the esas and ignore the rest of the country <e> <s> is he satisfied that the information upon which the huntings report is based which goes up to was correct information in view of some of the remarks made about the lack of quality of aerial photographs etc <e> <s> also can he say whether the trends shown whether or not they were correct have been reversed in any way by a policy from the forestry commission during the last five years <e> <s> the information for this report goes up to i understand <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to add a new voice at this stage but it might be convenient for the minister to answer this point at the same time <e> <s> going back to page paragraph if we are so concerned about the tenants in that small paragraph it says that the disposal will not be invalidated if someone has failed to do all that he has to do in consulting tenants and so on <e> <s> what redress will the tenants have if a disposal takes place without their consent or without their knowledge which is perfectly possible if someone is not doing the job properly <e> <s> what redress will the tenants have and what compensation if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble baroness for her explanation of the order and we welcome it <e> <s> however there is just one small question which i should like to ask and also one small reservation that is that the value of permanent records of burial over the years is undoubted <e> <s> people require them for all kinds of reasons <e> <s> we would like to be reassured that where an authority decides to go over to computerised records there will still be a permanent record available <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i welcome the explanation but it does not quite meet my point <e> <s> i wonder whether permanent records will be made as a matter of course because it is not simply the point of the immediate relatives at that time requiring a permanent record but at some time in the future researchers or distant relatives perhaps from abroad may need to have access to the records <e> <s> will they exist in a permanent form <e> <s> computer records are not necessarily permanent unless they are printed out as a matter of course <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may intervene briefly <e> <s> probably uniquely in this chamber i have almost first-hand experience of shared ownership because a young member of my family embarked on the housing ladder by that means <e> <s> therefore i should like to say that i think it is an excellent scheme <e> <s> unfortunately it is not yet widespread <e>", "<cs> may i get this point clear <e> <s> i accept the noble lords remarks about picture selling <e> <s> after all getting a house so that you can sell it eventually is part of the exercise <e> <s> that is what shared ownership is all about <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with that <e> <s> my main concern is that the rent for the remainder of the property which is not being purchased is to be freed of control <e> <s> therefore the rent could go beyond what one would at the moment expect a rent to be <e> <s> otherwise why free it from control <e> <s> i do not understand the need for that exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that circular / is still the main guideline on green belts <e> <s> does he recall that in paragraph of that circular we were told that green belt boundaries which have been approved as part of a structure plan will be changed only in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> can he define exceptional circumstances if that is still the guideline <e>", "<cs> we wish to support the amendment explained in such detail by the noble lord lord diamond although i am a little surprised to hear him suggest in basically a clause stand part argument that the amendment could take the place of spzs <e> <s> i see the provision as a useful addition as well as an alternative if you like to spzs in that it could be used by authorities in an area where there is no question of declaring a simplified planning zone <e> <s> it could be a useful provision for quite small areas of land in almost any authority that wished to see development take place and wished to remove barriers to it <e> <s> whether or not we go ahead with spzs the amendment itself and standing by itself will be a provision worth having in the bill <e>", "<cs> it is not quite as the minister has said <e> <s> as i recall the words it is provided that a person any person not simply a developer not a person with an interest not a person living in the area but any person can require the secretary of state to investigate <e> <s> that puts a quite different complexion on it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister feels like that because i think that in the end with a little more reflection it will be seen that this would be a better process <e> <s> i think that the end product would be better because the impact of spzs on surrounding areas is something that we may have to consider very carefully and we shall come on to that in a later amendment <e> <s> at this point i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for reminding me of schedule <e> <s> can he enlighten me further <e> <s> that schedule also has a heading <e>", "<cs> this puts a new complexion on part of the provision <e> <s> i was not aware under the terms of the schedule as it stands that local authorities could alter a scheme at the request of residents when a scheme was in existence <e> <s> i understood that the local residents could ask for a scheme or any person could ask for a scheme but i did not understand that they could come to the local authority say that the scheme was a nuisance to them and ask that it be looked at again <e> <s> then what happens <e>", "<cs> with that explanation i should like to give further consideration to this and beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> in spite of the apparent effect of this amendment we are opposed to it <e> <s> the reason is that <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had already demolished the completion order escape route <e> <s> as has been represented to me in the beginning completion notices have to last for at least months and they are dependent upon the secretary of states confirmation and subject to appeal <e> <s> however as i went on to explain the secretary of state has recently shown that he is inclined to support completion notices where a development is concerned <e>", "<cs> i probably have a slight advantage over the minister and over the noble lord lord diamond because i think that they have already made their clause stand part speeches <e> <s> we have already had a considerable discussion on the provisions of these two clauses and we are about to discuss them even more as we come on to schedule <e> <s> so perhaps it will not surprise anyone if i now say that we do not like the proposal for simplified planning zones in their present form <e>", "<cs> i seem to be having some difficulty in getting my point across <e> <s> i hope i did not say that spzs strike at the heart of local democracy <e> <s> i hope that what i said certainly it is what i meant to say was <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister to clarify what he has just said <e> <s> is he saying that the political complexion of the authority would be a factor that the secretary of state would take into consideration <e> <s> what he said sounded like that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that clarification <e> <s> i am rather surprised that it would apply to something like this which until now i had thought was a fairly non-political exercise <e> <s> i note what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> there is some reassurance in the ministers words <e> <s> i moved the amendment without hope and i was quite right <e> <s> i beg to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a brief comment on this amendment <e> <s> the association of district councils are not entirely happy with this amendment <e> <s> although health and safety considerations obviously must come first in matters concerning hazardous substances the feeling of the association of district councils is that they are not the only consideration <e> <s> indeed they would wish to have a discretion <e> <s> if another condition were necessary some type of planning control or perhaps some visual means of disguising what is there they would wish to have the power to put that into action <e> <s> i wonder whether this matter has been considered whether the government have thought of it and whether the minister has any answer to give on the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that encouraging reply <e> <s> we shall look hopefully for a government amendment at the next stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps begin by welcoming the noble earl lord dundee on his first and very competent appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> i wish him well <e> <s> at this time of night there is very little that i want to add to what the noble lord lord foot has said <e> <s> we support the amendment fully regretting that it should be necessary at this time in our lives to have to come back to this sort of legislation <e> <s> the amendment is however necessary <e> <s> we support it and hope that the government will take the correct view <e>", "<cs> i think i have had the answers i expected more or less <e> <s> if i may mention the last one first i do not see why farm buildings and farmers should not have to conform to a general standard as everyone else does <e> <s> within other activities very small <e>", "<cs> i do not think we want to get into that argument but i can find some that are not <e> <s> we shall continue the discussion on another occasion <e>", "<cs> i think that the reply is unnecessarily defeatist <e> <s> as i said earlier i have spent a considerable amount of time on traffic committees <e>", "<cs> yes it does <e>", "<cs> obviously i shall need to read with care what i have just been told by the minister <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had just one or two comments to make on amendment no <e> <s> and perhaps the ministers details will answer them <e> <s> i have condensed my comments to a very small amount <e> <s> the association of district councils have expressed a worry about the propriety of slipping into a bill about housing and planning a clause which makes certain changes to the financial provisions affecting a wide range of public inquiries on other subjects <e> <s> they are also worried and ask questions about whether the representatives of the myriad interests affected by this change have been consulted or are even aware of it <e> <s> finally they are clearly still worried that the intention of the exercise is to transfer more costs to local authorities <e>", "<cs> i must raise the same objection that we made earlier this evening which is that the effect of this new clause will be that enterprise zones now will last for a minimum period of years and could possibly last indefinitely <e> <s> our objection is for the same reason as we gave earlier namely that completion notices on which the local authority will have to rely where a development has been begun take a long time to become effective <e> <s> they only come into effect at least months from the date the notice is issued <e> <s> they are subject to appeal and are dependent on the secretary of states confirmation <e> <s> the net effect is that if the <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that where it is not a simple matter there might be an approach to third parties <e> <s> i am not sure what his intention is <e>", "<cs> i accept the spirit of what the minister has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that very full reply <e> <s> i should like to welcome him on the occasion of his first appearance at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in cambridge although there may have been some reduction in the nuisance it has not appeared so <e> <s> we have had many complaints this year about it <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether among the alternative uses that he has mentioned there is one to convert straw into paper <e> <s> does he recall that in january of this year the noble lord lord belstead gave me a hopeful answer on that <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether any progress has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i must answer some of the points that the minister has made <e> <s> he said that local plans and structure plans are not up to date <e> <s> that can be true <e> <s> it is also true that many of them are up to date having been just completed and though local plans cover only a portion of the countryside structure plans cover all of it <e> <s> they are not detailed we are aware of that but they indicate quite clearly where development is expected to take place and where it will be encouraged which in itself should be enough to provide a basis for the investigation of an spz <e> <s> as for being out of date simplified planning zones themselves will be out of date as out of date as most of these other provisions after they have been in existence for two or three years <e> <s> is the minister saying that they should then cease to exist because they are out of date or that they should be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the full reply that the minister has given and i am encouraged particularly about may and shall which is new to me <e> <s> obviously i shall have to study very carefully what the minister has said but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am puzzled by his reference to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i did not speak to amendment no <e> <s> and was not intending to move it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> naturally i am disappointed although not at all surprised by the ministers reply <e> <s> we seem to spend a great deal of time trying to defend what we consider to be the vulnerability of local democracy in this legislation but the minister appears not to see it that way <e> <s> i shall have to read carefully what he said and think again about the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am relieved to hear that there is not a new power though the bill reads very much like that <e> <s> however i accept the ministers explanation <e> <s> i shall read what he said and check with my advisers <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister to come back a little on this <e> <s> although he says in the letter which i have seen that this difficulty is mostly grammatical the view of the association of district councils is that it is considerably more than that <e> <s> it comments that the amendment has been introduced at short notice and though the ministers remarks would seem to indicate that there had been consultation it feels that opposition to it is likely to be very strong <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord contemplate asking his right honourable friend to offer a tax incentive so that the period between the introduction of unleaded petrol on a wide scale and cars capable of using it and the time when old cars stop using leaded petrol is not too long <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that that period could be extended for say years and that a tax incentive either on the cost of the unleaded petrol or on the cars that are capable of using it would speed up matters considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take up the point made by the noble lord lord gainford and tell us what plans the government have to give information and advice to people who are buying cars within the next years as to what they should do <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord nugent but i should also like an answer to the question about car tax and whether there could not be a differential there <e>", "<cs> my lords is that list to be publicised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the discussions attention was drawn to the delay in reaching a decision on dangerous products especially dangerous toys <e> <s> are the government prepared to take action by themselves on toy safety especially in this season <e> <s> is the minister aware that we are almost daily hearing of imported dangerous toys being on sale in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady elliot said this is not a political bill and i hope that it will not be turned into one as we go through its various stages <e> <s> as the debate has shown all of us with the single notable exception of the noble lord lord airedale who wants none of it support the bill <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord has good reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but the noble earl did rather give me a pounding on sewage sludge so i felt i owed him that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister <e> <s> is he referring to regulations which will disappear with the act <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think it is the custom of the house that when intervening in an unscheduled manner the intervention should be kept short <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that there is widespread concern about abuses of the system particularly with regard to animals transported in british transport across the channel then transferred to french transport and thence taken to spain where serious abuses take place <e> <s> is he aware that the rspca and members of the public are concerned about this matter <e> <s> does his department feel any responsibility for it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that we warmly welcome the announcement about lundy and are pleased about the progress so far although we are sorry that it initially took five years for lundy to be declared a marine nature reserve <e> <s> does he <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can cap that <e> <s> i add my thanks to the noble lord lord nathan for his patient and courteous chairmanship of the committee as well as his expertise and indeed for the comprehensive way he has introduced the subject this afternoon which leaves very little for the rest of us to do <e> <s> it was a very interesting subject and the committee had to discuss matters outside the scope of the proposal <e> <s> indeed we all found it so fascinating that the difficulty was to restrain ourselves for most of the time to something approaching the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i missed the figures that the minister gave for the beaches which have already been designated under the directive but the directive is six years old and the last figure i had was <e> <s> can he explain why the government are having such difficulty in designating more than that number if that is still the number when france has designated something like beaches under the same directive <e> <s> is he aware that many of us particularly on this side of the house feel that our beaches are a <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that however excellent the various alternatives may be there is no substitute for a good conservation policy so far as energy is concerned <e> <s> can he reassure the house that the governments present policy of privatising energy sources will not mean that they let up on their conservation programme <e>", "<cs> naturally i am disappointed that the minister is not prepared to give this matter some more consideration <e> <s> i should have said at the beginning that this amendment was supported very strongly by the national consumer council the consumers association which i mentioned and also <e>", "<cs> before i mention the amendment i thank the minister for his kind words to me earlier which in the heat of the moment on the last amendment i forgot to acknowledge <e> <s> i am grateful <e> <s> his was a reassuring reply <e> <s> i am not convinced that the legislation will catch the trader who sets out to deceive because it will be too easy to mark something not sold as new and to get rid of it on the market <e>", "<cs> this is an enabling power <e> <s> we are not saying that the secretary of state shall but that he may <e> <s> he need not use all the power at any one time <e> <s> we are agreed i think that the need is probably not very great but there can be occasions when it will be necessary <e>", "<cs> a recall system works in the united states and i firmly believe that if they can do it so can we <e> <s> i do not see why the minister feels that it is impossible to do the same <e> <s> every item of note that is distributed has records which show how and where it is distributed <e> <s> there may not necessarily be a record of every customer who buys it but a recall notice could work to a large extent particularly with goods still unsold <e> <s> however i can see that i am not going to get anywhere with this tonight so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that all the survey methods used by the authorities during the year are open to question <e> <s> that is admitted in the report <e> <s> a certain number of adjustments has had to be made because of the unsatisfactory nature of some of the tests <e> <s> would it not be sensible in order to get results on which we can rely for the government to put the overall control of the exercise into the hands of either the nerc or the wrcs so that we can be satisfied that the results we obtain are results on which we can work <e> <s> can the noble lord also say whether any attempt is being made to meet the requirements of the ec directive on water for human consumption and whether our categories would be in line with that directive <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clarify a point <e> <s> it was not so much a question of monitoring the results as of making sure that the tests which were done were realistic tests and were generally agreed <e> <s> there seems to be a different kind of test applied in different parts of the country <e> <s> that means that the overall comparisons are not very valuable <e>", "<cs> we support the spirit behind this amendment <e> <s> i shall refer to the wording a little later <e> <s> the association of county councils is concerned about the wording of the bill as it stands and is anxious that it should be changed and this provision removed <e> <s> we agree with most of the arguments put by the noble baroness <e> <s> we feel that if the government mean the health and safety executive or any other bodies they should say so in the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish to reinforce what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i shall quote what the minister said on second reading <e>", "<cs> i have a question to put to the minister which has been suggested to us by the chief officer of the trading standards department of cambridgeshire <e> <s> it refers to the fact that this clause seems to preclude the giving of public warnings in relation to unsafe goods <e> <s> it is a very long and complicated clause <e> <s> this aspect of it has just been drawn to our attention otherwise we should have put forward a probing amendment earlier about this <e> <s> i give notice to the minister that we should like an answer to this question <e> <s> he may not be able to answer it tonight and of course we shall quite understand that <e> <s> however the trading standards officer for cambridgeshire says <e>", "<cs> we have the greatest sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble earl not only because we feel that it is right that people should be able to buy british when they wish to do so and not only because buying british usually means that one gets better quality <e> <s> people also often wish to avoid buying from other countries for a variety of reasons <e> <s> for example there are many who would not wish to buy toys from taiwan where the safety record is not good <e> <s> there are many who would not wish to buy goods from south africa for reasons of which the committee will be aware <e> <s> there are many countries which for a variety of reasons fall on to the black list of many people who do not wish to support them <e> <s> however above all many people wish to buy british where they can <e> <s> i think that opinion is widely held in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us some idea of what is happening to sites of special scientific interest which are awaiting renotification and are on government property belonging to the ministry of defence the forestry commission maff or daff <e> <s> can he say whether those sites are protected by the fact that they are on government property and whether the government will be taking a sensible view even though they have not yet been renotified <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to say how much we welcome the statement <e> <s> i should also like to reassure the farming lobby that there are some conservationists who welcome the measures to improve the health of the rural economy which is absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure which the minister has just given include the cost to those whose lives are disrupted by the burst water main a cost which must be considerable <e> <s> is he aware that government control on water authority borrowing is preventing them from making the needed investment in water main replacement <e> <s> research has shown that materials are now available which would not burst whatever the weather <e> <s> mains can now be laid in polyethylene <e> <s> can he say whether the government have any plans to allow the water authorities to replace mains as necessary with that material <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement of his right honourable friend <e> <s> we are aware that the document to which he has referred is going out for two months consultation but we assume that when it was launched there was some idea of the direction that future planning procedures might take <e> <s> arising from that there are one or two questions that i should like to put to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister rather an important question about diverting funds from inner city rehabilitation and whether there was to be some means of preventing this happening given the added attraction of greenfield sites in the south which are obviously more profitable <e> <s> has any thought been given to this <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that this years grant figure is to be less in real terms than it was last year <e> <s> if that is so how does it square with the dedication of the secretary of state for energy to the energy conservation programme which he keeps reiterating <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to those of other noble lords to my noble friend lord stallard for giving the house this opportunity to debate this subject again today <e> <s> i think it is necessary for it to be debated again because as the noble lord lord belhaven and stenton said we try to pretend that winter does not happen in this country but every year we are surprised by it and every year we suffer from it <e> <s> the only answer is to keep pressing particularly in regard to the needs of elderly people in cold weather and to press the matter throughout the summer so that it is to be hoped by next winter we will see some improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not talking so much about the price as the conservation element and attempts to sell more of the product <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady david has asked me to apologise for her absence this evening which is unavoidable and to say on her behalf that she welcomes the clarification in the amendment especially in paragraph a <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the statement from the noble lord that the government support the findings of the select committee <e> <s> however we should like to know whether there has been a british initiative on any of the recommendations put forward by that committee and on any of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is something more to the problem than the answer she has just given <e> <s> a number of seaside resorts are suffering from this problem <e> <s> there is also the difficulty that the seaweed carries a lot of stones and this is altering the fishing areas <e> <s> would the noble baroness agree that the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food ought perhaps to take an interest in this because not just the seaweed but the alteration of the coastline can have a detrimental effect on fishing as well as on the tourist trade <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether any effort is being made to persuade contractors not to use high-grade limestone as roadstone <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not quite the question <e> <s> the question is whether contractors should be dissuaded from using high-grade limestone as roadstone because that would have beneficial effects on those quarries which produce high-grade limestone <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords who have spoken so far have agreed that there is a need to relieve the traffic congestion in lyndhurst <e> <s> i speak as a consumer in that i have been the victim of traffic jams in the area on many occasions although i confess that i have lived only in burley which is some distance away <e> <s> we are agreed on that matter and i believe that we should make that quite clear from the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in complimenting the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford on his competent and articulate maiden speech <e> <s> if his speech was uncontroversial i look forward to the day when he decides to be controversial <e> <s> i think that we shall have a lively time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many members of staff from the institute are leaving with the professor and going to the us <e> <s> is he aware that such scientists are even more important to us now than they were when the question was first asked <e> <s> have the government no anxieties about this <e> <s> are they doing anything to stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the ministers explanation but along with the noble lord lord mottistone i feel that there is still an area of unease here <e> <s> i hope that as the bill makes its way through the other place a slightly better solution may be found <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his support <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his long and detailed reply although i am not sure that i would have chosen drinking glasses as the best example for a discussion of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am intrigued by the rather bizarre picture of someone taking a chippendale chair to pieces to see whether it is up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister did not mean that he wanted dangerous goods in the market-place <e> <s> i was of course being facetious about chippendale <e> <s> i have been impressed by the fact that this amendment is supported by the consumers association <e> <s> i feel that its knowledge is certainly greater than mine <e> <s> it felt that it was a possibility that there should be greater protection on second-hand goods and i bow to its superior knowledge <e> <s> however i take the point that the minister has made on a number of matters and i should like to think again about this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> but the cases he cites are not those of manufacturers against whom we seek to apply this power <e> <s> reputable manufacturers care for their reputations and they co-operate with the government and do all that is necessary to see that unsafe products which have been sold in their name are not allowed to circulate <e> <s> those people are not a problem <e> <s> it is the next layer of less scrupulous manufacturers who exist <e> <s> the minister looks grieved but i assure him that they exist <e> <s> their products turn up on the market with great regularity <e> <s> consumer bodies can point to cases where unsafe goods which should have been recalled and destroyed have circulated <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to thank the minister for moving the amendment which largely meets the points my noble friend made in committee <e> <s> we are interested in the point that the noble lord lord renton has made and we look forward with interest to the ministers reply <e> <s> we are grateful for the amendment which is a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> however it seems to indicate that the department is not taking this matter as seriously as it might <e> <s> for example has the department of energy been consulted on the proposed deregulation of industrial buildings <e> <s> is the minister aware that the secretary of state has given a commitment to an ongoing energy conservation programme <e> <s> i am sure that he would not welcome any relaxation in regulations which would allow industrial buildings not to be insulated which is what the new regulations would do <e> <s> has the department been consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords what reassurance can we be given that the status of conservation designations will not be affected by the decision <e> <s> we should remember that the area involved is one of natural beauty with capital letters a sight of special scientific interest and a national nature reserve <e> <s> this must surely weaken the status of those designations in the future <e> <s> is the minister prepared to give any undertaking on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i should have preferred a little more detail but i am glad that some efforts are being made <e> <s> does he agree that it would be very fitting if the government were to mark the european year of the environment by upholding their obligations under the vienna convention to protect the ozone layer <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not really answer my question <e> <s> have the government taken a view on this <e> <s> are we to understand that they are going to honour their obligations or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that not unexpected reply <e> <s> is he aware that the disappointment which has been expressed arises from the lack of protection being offered flora and fauna <e> <s> if when the bill concludes its passage it does not have the comprehensive powers for which conservation societies are hoping will the government consider using their powers under the control of pollution act to establish water protection zones <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to my noble friend for raising this matter tonight so that we can once again ask questions about this subject which as he said has been going on for so long <e> <s> in addition to the questions which my noble friend listed we had a full debate on agricultural research and development in may last year <e> <s> at that time the noble lord lord belstead was not left in any doubt about the anxieties in this house over the whole state of agricultural research and development <e> <s> in particular the problems of the pbi and the nsdo were specially mentioned by a number of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that we are agreed on the importance of maintaining an early warning system <e> <s> but can he say whether it is true that alternatives are available which would be just as good as fylingdales and which would not cost a great deal to bring into use <e> <s> can he say how much weight was given to the fact that this was in a national park and how much effort was made to get the site out of the national park <e> <s> in other words how many other sites were seriously considered before this new proposition went ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister consider that aonach mhor could provide quite a good case for development as fort william needs more economic development <e> <s> however so far as lurchers crag is concerned i support the words of the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that so far as i can discover dafs has not done any research on the sand eel <e> <s> there is a chance that we may do irreversible damage unless we can find out what its place is in the food chain <e> <s> does the minister not feel that such research should be undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister also aware that sand eels are harvested taken to denmark and norway turned into pig food and sold back to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i know that the watch trust too will be very grateful for what he has just said <e> <s> does he agree i think he does from his answer that it is important in terms of environmental care for the future that we should involve young people and do everything we can to draw in as many as possible <e> <s> can he say whether further grants will be forthcoming for watch because the sum which he has just mentioned generous though it is is something like per cent <e> <s> of the amount it has asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the anglian water authority is already having to import pure water in order to dilute the water it extracts because of the presence of an excessive amount of nitrates <e> <s> does he not think that he has given a rather complacent answer about the quality of the water being produced for us to drink <e> <s> can he say what further action he proposes to take to ensure that the presence of excessive nitrates is guarded against in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords although i speak from this dispatch box this is a private bill and i therefore speak as an individual though i suspect that i should have support from many of my colleagues in the questions that i propose to ask <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> it would seem from the debate so far today and from the views expressed by the petitioners that a number of questions can legitimately be put to the committee <e> <s> i shall give them not necessarily in order of priority but in the order in which they occured to me as i went through the papers <e> <s> first should further progress on the project await the results of a hydrographic survey <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy tells us that a report has now been submitted <e> <s> but we hear from the noble lord lord raglan that this is probably a desk job and not one that is based on all the evidence which one would need to carry out a development of this importance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that reinforces my point very well <e> <s> that is somethng which must be cleared up by the committee in its investigations <e>", "<cs> my lords seven minutes is not enough time to deal with what has been an excellent debate but i happily devote seconds or so to the noble baroness lady stedman in order to thank her for the opportunity to have the debate <e> <s> perhaps i may be forgiven if i single out just one or two things for which i have a particular feeling particularly lord buxtons passionate plea for the flow country which i think we should all heed <e> <s> i should like to add too to lord morans statistics on the rspb which were quite telling <e> <s> i understand that this year they are attracting new members at the rate of every week <e> <s> that should make the political parties think if nothing else does <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a limited debate <e> <s> if i can finish within seven minutes perhaps we can return to that point <e> <s> in addition there must be a requirement that environmental considerations should be part of every activity <e> <s> every significant action of government or local government because we must not forget the impact that local government has on the environment must be automatically examined for possible environmental consequences to the best of the knowledge which prevails at the time <e> <s> all major development applications whether publicly or privately funded should be required to be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment <e> <s> i believe that this requirement should be introduced now <e> <s> it is being introduced in as a result of european community requirement <e> <s> but i hope that whichever government are in power after the election will realise that this matter is most important and will introduce it now <e> <s> some big developments where this has not been done are going ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to deal briefly with two subjects which have not had a great deal of attention so far <e> <s> one is water privatisation about which we heard from the noble viscount lord simon and the other is environmental protection <e> <s> it is interesting to compare the two sentences of the gracious speech which refer to these items <e> <s> one states <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord accept that though i regret the way in which this question has been discussed nevertheless i think that there is a question to be answered <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord aware that a number of politically uncommitted people were worried by that interview and by the tone in which the questions were answered <e> <s> i think we would do well not to dismiss it too lightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disturbed by the rather complacent reply which the minister has given <e> <s> is he not aware that the department of the environment produced a report called <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the water authorities association said last year that it would like to introduce such zones but needed co-operation and help from the government in order to do so <e>", "<cs> in paragraph of its report the select committee attaches great importance to the environmental quality of the landscape and to the need to secure the highest standards of design and management in executing the entirety of the a improvements <e> <s> that paragraph ends <e>", "<cs> if i could clear the point as a percentage of the total expenditure the figure is relevant <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his as usual courteous reply <e> <s> i still feel that there is an argument to be made for a regional approach on this and i should still like to see general guidelines for the protection of the country side which were outside any local plan because quite often there is a conflict when the boundary is crossed <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the minister has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister seems to base his case on the need to trust the undertaking given by british rail <e> <s> i am sorry to say that the damage that has been done to the site as a preliminary to survey work has been done within the last two weeks which is after the undertaking was given <e> <s> noble lords can scarcely be surprised therefore if the london wildlife trust and the other local groups feel a little diffident about accepting the rest of british rails undertakings <e> <s> i am sorry to have to undermine the ministers argument but this is a fact and somewhere i have photographs of the damage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that we are as bored with having to ask the same question as i am sure he is with having to answer it <e> <s> may i ask two constructive questions <e> <s> when the legislation is being discussed with the nature conservancy council would it be possible to discuss removing the right of veto <e> <s> is the minister aware that at the moment any one party to the negotiations can veto the whole exercise <e> <s> would it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider putting a time limit on discussions if everything else is unacceptable to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i also begin by thanking the noble lord lord nathan for the way in which he has presented this report <e> <s> as always he leaves very little for other members of the committee to say <e> <s> i therefore crave your lordships indulgence if i repeat some of the remarks that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the three areas highlighted by the uk committee for the year include pollution control and waste <e> <s> can the minister say in that context whether the government have any plans to control the importation of waste which is worrying a great number of people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as progress is now being made towards a completed internal market does the minister agree that it is absolutely essential to get at the earliest possible date a general product safety directive that is in line with our own legislation <e> <s> what action will the united kingdom government take to make this a reality <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may follow up that point my understanding is that at the present rate of progress it would be at least two years before there was a real discussion on a directive <e> <s> i am asking whether her majestys government can do anything to hurry it up other than just agreeing in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is encouraging to hear that the british waterways board is going to clean up is the minister aware that no single authority is responsible for clearing the rubbish out of this or any other river unless the water flow is impeded or unless there is pollution <e> <s> does he not think that in urban situations such as this it would be a good idea for the department of the environment to take on some responsibility <e> <s> i stress this particularly for urban rivers because the riparian owners can scarcely be expected to look after their bit in these situations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the way in which he introduced the bill and the reassuring things he said about its objectives <e> <s> we welcome the establishment of the new broads authority <e> <s> at this point let me say that we applaud the work of the voluntary authority which has battled on since its beginnings against great odds and has done some very valuable work although obviously without the necessary powers to do as much as it would have liked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that perhaps rather predictable answer <e> <s> but is he aware that the solvents marketing branch of ici advises small users there are now many thousands of them in the electronics <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to this but i think that my question has been misunderstood <e> <s> is the minister aware that market forces do not enter into my question because it concerns solvents which are being disposed of because they have been contaminated are no longer useful but still contain cfcs <e> <s> will he undertake to look again at the question if i table it again and come hack with a more satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> can he be a little more helpful about the possible timetable <e> <s> in view of the fact that this proposal appeared in the governments election manifesto one would expect that a little more attention could be given to introducing it <e> <s> after all we have waited years for such legislation <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether there is opposition from any quarter if so how real that opposition is and what steps the government are taking to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on this matter but is the noble lord aware that the views of the moorland association or at least the views of moorland grouse shooting interests were made clear to the forum and that the final result was brought forward in the light of those views <e> <s> i understand that the moorland association has members <e> <s> in view of the very large number of members represented by the other bodies could not more weight be given to their views <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that this is a nationwide problem and not confined to london <e> <s> it is aggravated by the fact that plastics are now being used in packaging which is already very excessive <e> <s> do the government have any long-term plans for the overall management of packaging and indeed of waste disposal generally which includes the litter being collected <e> <s> we are now running out of places to put it so the government must have some overall plans for this <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government say that local authorities are responsible can the minister tell us whether or not as part of this campaign mr branson liaised with local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords first i make clear that although i speak from the opposition front bench i speak in a personal capacity since this is a private bill and not on behalf of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i am sorry lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> when both campbells are coming it is a hit hard to distinguish <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea of the amendments i tabled is not to exclude all marginal land <e> <s> if a piece of marginal land had notable habitat interests we would wish it to be excluded <e> <s> we wanted an assurance that it would be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> her words are very comforting and i shall read them with great care <e> <s> perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i do not think the needs of curlews lapwings and humans are mutually exclusive <e> <s> i hope we can all live in harmony with them <e> <s> certainly it would not be my wish to exclude humans so that the curlews and lapwings could flourish <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should like to compliment the minister on his first appearance dealing with environmental matters on the agility with which he answered all the questions and on the comprehensive way he dealt with them <e> <s> i know that he will be writing perhaps concerning the voluntary organisations about which people are very concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble earl for this very timely question <e> <s> the value of it is obvious from the speeches that we have heard tonight and some of them were very moving speeches <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that quite soon we are to have a definition of waste which will be acceptable to everyone <e> <s> with the greatest respect i do not believe that the ministers reply will be very useful in that local authorities can define waste in their contracts for the purposes of recycling <e> <s> i do not believe it to be a good idea to have different definitions of waste operating up and down the country <e> <s> however i am very pleased with the reply on the later amendments <e> <s> so far as concerns amendment no <e> <s> i wish to think a little more about what has been said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased indeed with the ministers reply <e> <s> i note what he says about woodland <e> <s> but there are areas of ancient woodland and woods which are also sssis where perhaps there would need to be an exclusion <e> <s> i am sure that if the minister is approaching the amendment in the spirit in which he has suggested the answer that will come will be acceptable <e> <s> therefore i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i should have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> with these two amendments because one cannot divide them <e> <s> if i may i will say just a little more <e>", "<cs> before i decide what to do with the amendment can the minister answer two questions <e> <s> his noble friend sitting behind him indicated that there was a danger of hybridisation of the bill if the amendment were to be accepted <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord answer my question on alternates as regards the one member of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i specifically asked that question earlier <e>", "<cs> i need to know about hybridisation in relation to this amendment <e>", "<cs> we are taking rather longer over this amendment than i expected <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady blatch that yes i am sure that many people who come from local authorities will be interested in conservation <e> <s> i do not doubt that <e> <s> however that is not the point at issue <e> <s> the point concerns what is actually written into the bill now and for the possible future changes in local authorities <e> <s> that is a danger we should guard against <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may put one more question to him <e> <s> if i were not to press the amendment and i am conscious of the need to preserve the bill can the minister say whether the government are likely to issue guidelines which would not be on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am a little taken aback at the fierceness of the ministers reply <e> <s> after all this is the <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the committee wishes to get on but we have to deal with these amendments <e> <s> on second reading the noble baroness lady blatch raised the question of a chief officer <e> <s> i am glad to see that some facility is made for a definition of how he should be appointed <e> <s> however there is no mention in this amendment about a decision on a chief officer <e> <s> is that not a matter for the bill <e>", "<cs> i was not aware that the minister was referring to lateness in that respect <e> <s> i understood him to criticise the fact that we are discussing the matter at all <e> <s> in support of my noble friends comments perhaps i may say that to tell us that something was fully discussed in another place is not an answer <e> <s> the committee is not a rubber stamp <e> <s> we are entitled to discuss matters at length if we wish to do so <e> <s> however i can see that i shall get no further <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister can answer two brief questions <e> <s> the amendment represents a considerable reduction in numbers from to <e> <s> i am anxious that the authority should not go on too long with such a reduced membership <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give me an idea of a timescale over which the appointments will be made <e> <s> he will appreciate in view of the arguments which we had earlier this evening that the balance could be tipped one way or the other by a delay in some appointments <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will forgive me but the number is not <e>", "<cs> i must make just one point <e> <s> we have spent -odd minutes at the beginning of this evening arguing about the importance of one extra body for the nature conservancy council <e> <s> the minister is now telling us that it does not really matter too much if two or three of them are missing when the authority starts <e> <s> either one person is important or he is not <e> <s> i hope that a date will be set for the appointment of the full authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that very comprehensive answer to my rather long question <e> <s> is he aware of the extra costs involved in clearing ancient woodlands <e> <s> for example a pollarded beech can cost four times as much as a normal tree to remove <e> <s> therefore can he say whether his inter-departmental committee on storm damage which is at the moment sitting will be able to make recommendations specifically about ancient woodlands <e> <s> is the committee considering them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one final brief question <e> <s> can the minister say when the report is expected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the house that it was never our intention to insist that local authorities should do this work themselves <e> <s> we merely wish to give them flexibility so that where it would cost more to go out to tender than to maintain the collection or whatever it be they would be given the option <e> <s> that is all we sought and i am grateful to the minister for his acceptance of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the european year of the environment has just days to run so this debate will probably be the last on conservation that we shall have during the year <e> <s> it is therefore very timely and we are grateful to the noble earl for giving us this opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a misunderstanding between me and the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that he was to speak at this point but if he is not i should like to say a few words on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place <e> <s> however i am afraid that there are a <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord beloff for this afternoons debate which he has opened in an unusually thoughtful and wide-ranging way that allows all of us to take up our particular interests on the subject of energy <e> <s> he has reminded us at an appropriate time that there is more to the discussion on energy than discussion about who owns it <e> <s> i therefore do not propose to talk about privatisation this afternoon although obviously it exists as a factor in our discussions <e> <s> i should like to say at this stage how much i too look forward to the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord weir <e> <s> i do not know his expertise on this matter and i look forward to hearing what he has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the greatest single worry of the public above nuclear energy the problem of radioactive waste disposal <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government have made any progress on the recommendation of the layfield report with regard to radioactive waste management <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in addition to the number of jobs created it is extremely important that the right kind of jobs should be created <e> <s> is the minister aware that in the past some of the jobs which have been provided are more suitable for the wives of miners than for the miners themselves <e> <s> can he say whether that fact is taken on <e>", "<cs> my lords at this point i should like to respond and say how warmly we on these benches endorse those remarks particularly as regards the staff <e> <s> we are very conscious of the efficient and willing support that we receive from staff in all quarters of the house <e> <s> we hope that they will have a relaxed and cheerful easter and will enjoy their rest <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what will happen to this project after privatisation should privatisation take place <e> <s> is it the governments intention to continue with funding or are they putting this project on the market too <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the noble viscount reconcile the first answer he gave to his noble friend with the fact that yesterday afternoon organisations met upstairs at an all-party gathering to express their anxieties about the privatisation of electricity and this included a representative of the national consumer council <e> <s> is his information up to date or have things moved on since he first obtained it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that within the industry there exists a strong body of opinion that little profit is to be made from the actual supply of water <e> <s> therefore is it not safe to assume that interest in shares in the water company may be based on the fact that we have notoriously under-valued our assets in previous privatisations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer my first question which was is he aware of the opinon within the industry that there is little or no profit in selling water <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on th may he promised that we should have the new regulations on the transportation of hazardous waste before the summer recess <e> <s> can he say whether they are available and will the house have them before the recess <e> <s> has the minister read the fourth chapter of the third report of the hazardous waste inspectorate in which it expresses grave disquiet about imported waste and not least about the labelling of canisters which leaves much to he desired <e> <s> do the government intend to take further steps to improve the labelling of imported canisters <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first welcome the noble baroness on her first appearance at the dispatch box in her new position <e> <s> from these benches we congratulate her on her new appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that even if we were to go over per cent <e> <s> to nuclear energy the lead time required to bring in the power stations that we need is so long that we need a most positive energy conservation programme now if we are to help to avoid the greenhouse effect which is already causing some damage throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords would this not be a good moment for the government to implement section of the conservation of seals act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister but my understanding of section is that it is not a case of a general licence being issued but rather specific licences where it is considered that there is a particular problem with regard to seals attacking fish <e> <s> the licences i believe are issued specifically to landowners <e> <s> i also understand that in quite a large number of licences were issued even though a very small number of deaths was reported <e> <s> is the minister satisfied that where licences are issued every seal death that occurs under those licences is being reported <e>", "<cs> my lords can the house be given a few specific facts in relation to the new affirmation that we are asked to accept <e> <s> for example the natural environment research council is to lose jobs this year all concerned with environmental research <e> <s> are those losses not now to take place <e> <s> will the million of agricultural research which has been cut this year be reinstated <e> <s> will the privatisation of water be looked at again <e> <s> can we expect that the proposed reduction in sewage treatment regulations which was to accompany privatisation will not now take place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say when the government intend to publish the halcrow report <e> <s> will he confirm that that report indicates that the present monitoring programme for ground water is seriously inadequate <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that there is an urgent need to introduce water protection zones we have asked about this on many occasions especially in high-risk areas and while any proposed trial treatments are being contemplated <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister answer my question about the halcrow report which is already in his hands <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the government support of the polluter pays principle holds good for water <e> <s> it is unfair that those who are polluted against should have to foot the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords for all its brevity this is probably one of the most important reports before the house certainly in my time as a member <e> <s> we are grateful to the committee for its work and to the noble earl lord cranbrook for the way in which he presented the report <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the governments concern tie in with the code of practice issued by the department of transport to local authorities <e> <s> that code says that litter bins shall be removed from all-purpose trunk roads that all-purpose kerbed rural roads shall not be swept more than once a year and that all-purpose kerbed urban roads shall not be swept more than twice a year <e> <s> does this not seem very much out of line with what people in this country are thinking and what the government are saying <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that some different government departments and agencies are concerned in activities that affect our whole maritime environment including the north sea <e> <s> will the minister explain what machinery exists for coordination with all the different departments and agencies <e> <s> if there is no such machinery do the government have any plans to set up an independent unit to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister on the co-ordination aspect <e> <s> although i am relieved to hear that his department is the lead department can conflicts within that department be resolved <e> <s> for example there is a likelihood of conflict between the pollution inspectorate and the new river authorities <e> <s> strains already exist as can be seen from the separate reports which are issued <e> <s> can the minister reassure us on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for replying but does he appreciate that that is a very disappointing answer <e> <s> is he aware that during the long discussions which there have been on this report deregistration of commons has proceeded apace <e> <s> can he explain why discussions are taking so long <e> <s> i understand that a large measure of agreement has been reached by most of the parties concerned <e> <s> is the noble earl now saying that there is a new government criterion for legislation that we must have per cent <e> <s> agreement before we can proceed <e> <s> if that is so we shall look for a very different attitude on forthcoming legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the minister a little on his answer <e> <s> can he tell us why this legislation is now held up <e> <s> in response to questions last year we were given to understand that as soon as agreement had been reached with the moorlands association there would be no further bar to bringing legislation forward <e> <s> is he saying that agreement has not yet been reached or is he saying that it has been reached and legislation is still not forthcoming <e> <s> we need a little more information <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> can he tell the house who will be consulted about the findings of that report <e> <s> for example will the conservation bodies be consulted and who else is likely to be consulted <e> <s> can he also tell us what we are to deduce from the fact that even in advance of the publication of the report the nature conservancy council is to experience a cut in its funding for next year <e> <s> i am aware that there is a million increase in the amount of money paid but of that is earmarked for abernethy and allowing for inflation the remaining money represents a cut in real terms of per cent <e> <s> in the budget <e> <s> is there any connection between what may happen as a result of the report and that cut in the councils money <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the minister can continue to hide behind year-old statistics <e> <s> i asked a question about next years funding <e> <s> can he answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but this is a fact and the minister is avoiding it <e> <s> there is to be a cut in real terms for next year of per cent <e> <s> one cannot escape that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on occasions her majestys inspectorate of pollution gives authorisations without any consultation with local environmental health officers <e> <s> does not the noble earl agree that there should be a statutory requirement for local consultation to take place before authorisation is given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the pelicans are probably becoming very depressed first by being harangued by new mps practising their speeches and secondly by noble lords wandering around in the dead of night spying on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he recall that it is over seven years since discussions began on this designation <e> <s> can the minister say whether he considers that there is likely to be any further delay <e> <s> i understand that there is still one outstanding disagreement as regards this project it concerns the sub-aqua club <e> <s> can the minister say whether very much weight is likely to be given to this and whether it is the governments policy to seek per cent <e> <s> agreement before they will proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the ministers reply to an earlier question that he is seeking per cent <e> <s> agreement <e> <s> can the minister also say whether this represents a new policy on the part of the government because they have pushed through many measures with nothing like per cent <e> <s> agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the survey carried out last year for industry into packaging and the environment <e> <s> half the to year-olds interviewed were not aware that it was a criminal offence to drop litter <e> <s> does he agree that we should pursue the education of children in schools about care for the environment generally and about litter in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the fitting of compact fluorescent lamps in the palace of westminster would reduce the energy consumption of lighting to one tenth of its present level <e> <s> does he realise that such a course would not only save energy but because those lamps last five times as long as normal bulbs the saving in maintenance would be very great also <e> <s> it does not need a consultancy firm to tell the noble lord that <e>", "<cs> my lords in october regulations were brought forward to extend the closed season on seals for two years but they did nothing about special licences issued for shooting purposes <e> <s> have any such licences been issued since october and if so how many <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that encouraging reply <e> <s> however is he aware of the anxiety arising from the fact that dr stebbings of the institute of terrestrial ecology who is a leading bat expert and who has been leading the research on bat populations is to be made redundant <e> <s> that does not seem to be in keeping with the general approach of the government on such matters <e> <s> can the noble earl assure the house that work done so far at great expense and over many years will not be wasted <e>", "<cs> my lords what discussions are taking place with producers of cfcs here and in other countries particularly those that have subsidiaries in under-developed countries <e> <s> is there full co-operation with the industry so far as he is aware <e> <s> i do not refer simply to our own producers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness say what the governments attitude is to the use of tenderising enzymes which are injected into animals in abattoirs before death <e> <s> is she aware that unless death follows fairly quickly the animals involved suffer <e> <s> is she happy that the regulations are sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confine my few remarks this evening to environmental matters some of which have already been touched upon <e> <s> in company with almost every other speaker i think that the formation of the nra which is what we must call it at present despite the remarks made by the noble earl lord cranbrook is a useful development in pollution control <e> <s> but despite all the arguments which have been made this afternoon i still believe that it could have been created without privatisation of the whole water industry <e> <s> its function could have been part of a much needed environmental protection agency to strengthen and co-ordinate all aspects of environmental protection <e> <s> as it is we are offered a body with strategic responsibilities for water polluton control but with no strategic responsibilities for ensuring that the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he not aware that there is one outstanding matter at skomer <e> <s> i refer to the dispute between divers and fishermen <e> <s> can the noble earl tell the house whether the government are to give a clear lead on that matter or whether we are to go on for ever with the present situation <e> <s> is not the noble earl aware that for the third year in succession a temporary liaison officer has been appointed <e> <s> does that mean that for at least another year nothing will happen in relation to skomer <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that the nature conservancy council is reducing its commitment to marine conservation when one takes into account the fact that it has transferred certain headings <e> <s> for example marine birds used to be dealt with under the birds heading but it has now been transferred to marine conservation <e> <s> in effect that is a cut in the marine conservation budget <e> <s> can the noble earl comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am glad to hear that the report has at last been received <e> <s> however can he say what consultations are likely to take place other than those with the nature conservancy council <e> <s> for example will any of the voluntary bodies be concerned in the matter <e> <s> further if it is decided to sell off any of the national nature reserves will it be possible for such bodies to be helped to take them over <e>", "<cs> i rise primarily to assure my noble friend that he is not quite alone as regards those members of the committee who sit immediately behind him on these benches <e> <s> i should also like to say that i expect the minister to make the point that we must rely on the code of practice in this matter <e> <s> as regards that code of practice i shall make just two points <e> <s> first it represents a weakening of the criteria laid down in the land drainage proposals which were given i think about months ago <e> <s> secondly if members of the committee will turn to page of the bill and look at clause they will see that it says <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a slightly different question although i support my noble friend in his desire to see that angling remains within the reach of all those who currently enjoy it <e> <s> i am rather concerned that in the pursuit of maximising profits from angling societies insufficient regard will be paid to the needs of conservation which after all is in the long-term interests of the anglers <e>", "<cs> can the minister answer my question about which conservation bodies are meant in the code of practice <e> <s> is it the nature conservancy council the countryside commission or whom <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i shall try not to repeat so much that has been said which i endorse <e> <s> however i should like to say that i believe that an important part of the amendment is subsection b <e> <s> that subsection gives an opportunity for the secretary of state in consultation with the appropriate agencies to give protection to land which falls outside the popular designations <e> <s> that provision is badly needed in the bill <e> <s> it would allow proper consideration to be given to continuing sympathetic management once the <e>", "<cs> i reinforce what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i hope that the minister has been provided with a somewhat longer brief than the one he used to introduce the amendments because i believe he will need it <e> <s> i should like to reinforce the remarks of my noble friend in relation to the dangers of creating three-tier landscapes <e> <s> i cannot see what relationship the amendment as a technical amendment bears to the bill as it stands <e> <s> we need a great deal more explanation of how national parks and the broads authority are fitted in almost as an afterthought <e> <s> there is the question of what happens to land within the national parks which is divided into two grades and to land outside the national parks which is presumably degraded completely and can therefore be up for grabs as and when required <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to question the position of the broads <e> <s> i am sorry if i was misunderstood <e> <s> i am well aware of the relationship of the broads authority to the national parks and i would not have questioned that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we agree when he says that we are but a small part of the world scene of users of cfcs <e> <s> is he further aware however that we are one of the major producers of cfcs not only through our own companies but also through their subsidiaries <e> <s> can the minister tell us what is the programme for phasing out the production of cfcs as against their use in this country <e> <s> is a date fixed for ending their production <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i may ask the noble baroness whether we are to understand from her reply that the energy efficiency office is expected to continue <e> <s> and can we be sure that it is going to continue with realistic funding <e> <s> we have no grounds for optimism from what has happened to it this year <e> <s> can she say whether that has been considered and can she give us some proper report on what she is expecting to happen <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am a little disappointed at having the consumer protection act invoked in this case <e> <s> however i should like to read carefully what the noble lord has said especially in relation to the second part of my amendment <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me if the answer to my question is included in the amendment and i have not spotted it <e> <s> can the noble earl say what will happen to a single rural consumer living in a cottage who wishes to be connected to the mains supply <e> <s> does the amendment mean that he must pay the entire cost of having water piped to him in the cottage <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord stanley in this amendment <e> <s> rural communities are already disadvantaged in many ways regarding urban dwellers <e> <s> they have seen the collapse of the public transport system in many rural areas <e> <s> they have seen house prices soaring as car-borne workers from the cities come to buy houses and put them beyond the price affordable by residents in rural communities <e> <s> the government are constantly arguing that water is no different from any other commodity <e> <s> we have tried to prove otherwise but the government have refused to accept it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment can the minister enlarge a little upon what he considers to be a justifiable expense in this case <e> <s> i am not at all clear as to what he means <e> <s> if one looks at the matter coldly it would be justifiable to say that because the water has to be pumped a few miles without anyone taking anything off and paying for it the undertakers are justified in charging very much more per gallon per litre or however the cost will be assessed <e> <s> what is a justifiable increase therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand from the noble lords first reply to his noble friend that the free recovery scheme which is operated by ici among others does not apply to domestic refrigerators <e> <s> that was not quite clear <e> <s> if it does apply are not the government able to stretch their apparently limitless budget for advertising to include advertising on this subject so that the public may be better informed about how to dispose of their own refrigerators <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord crickhowell will be aware that whatever the reason for that draft it caused anxiety among conservation bodies <e> <s> the rspb in particular was concerned by the exclusion <e> <s> it feels that such exclusions if carried through all the rracs would lead to a wide gap in the expertise available to them <e> <s> the conservation bodies also feel that statutory provision for conservation experts should be made or the rracs may not obtain the level of expertise which they have so far enjoyed under their present title <e>", "<cs> my lords do the figures which the minister has given include anything to do with the new community forests <e> <s> can he tell us when he expects the first applications to be made in relation to the new community forests and whether they will start in the next planting season <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i should like to introduce the amendments which appear in my name and those of the noble lords lord moran lord norrie and lord addington <e> <s> if the debate is to continue we shall value the comments of noble lords on those amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain to the house the reason for the governments apparent reluctance to contribute to an international fund for the purposes of examining the greenhouse effect <e> <s> i understand that the idea of such a fund is supported by the united nations environment programme to which he has referred and also by the european community <e> <s> however it appears that the government are not prepared to support it <e> <s> can the noble earl explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i should like to reiterate that we appreciate the attempt in the new clause to cover our conservation worries <e> <s> it has gone a long way as we said in the earlier debate and we are happy with <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said his amendments nos <e> <s> an d have the effect which all of us who wished to protect the sssis desired that is all those of us who wished to see sssis included in the specific protections provided by clause but without the penalty which is now being imposed by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall try not to go over too many of the arguments which have already been put forward <e> <s> however the noble earl who has just spoken seemed concerned about the voting figures in the committee <e> <s> therefore perhaps we might go back to the voting figures in the synod <e> <s> after all those are the votes which really matter <e> <s> the measure gained support by a very comfortable majority <e> <s> the house of bishops cast per cent <e> <s> of its votes in favour the house of clergy cast per cent <e> <s> of its votes in favour and the house of laity per cent <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford said any government returned on the basis of such figures would consider that they had a landslide majority and a mandate for whatever they cared to do <e> <s> i think that we must be convinced by the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that throughout the report the two themes to which the ncc continually draws attention are the shortage of funds for looking after those reserves in its ownership and the shortage of expertise for looking after reserves nationally <e> <s> can the government give an assurance that whatever happens in the far distant future there will immediately be enough funds available to the ncc to carry out its duties satisfactorily during this coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that answer is slightly misleading <e> <s> although there has been an increase since in a -year period one would expect an increase during the present year there has been a per cent <e> <s> cut in grant to the ncc <e> <s> that is not very progressive given the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords since we are told that rationalisation is complete are we therefore to understand that the increased sales of forestry and forestry land are a result of the governments dissatisfaction with the work of the forestry commission <e> <s> if they are not dissatisfied with its work would it not be easier to leave that forestry in its hands and avoid all the legal complications which seem to cause such difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that some of us are very worried about the proposed widening of many motorways in order to accommodate congestion <e> <s> is not congestion often caused by the very practice that has been mentioned <e> <s> my noble friends question is very much to the point <e> <s> if we can reduce the need to widen motorways by proper use of existing lanes it would be a very valuable exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand the minister to say that the survey on which he bases his comments is six years old <e> <s> he said that a lot has changed since then <e> <s> what does he mean by that <e> <s> if a lot has changed why is there not another survey to bring the information up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the disquiet which has already been expressed by a number of noble lords <e> <s> i wish to return particularly to the regulation which covers the conservation access and recreation code of practice <e> <s> perhaps i may remind your lordships that we were given a draft code of practice in january this year <e> <s> many of us based our contributions to the water bill on the provisions of that draft code of practice <e> <s> we had every expectation that the majority of the promises at any rate would be fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i asked whether there would be <e>", "<cs> my lords given the increasingly international approach in wildlife conservation can the minister explain how there will be an international voice for the united kingdom in the future or whether indeed such a thought has been explored <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that whatever the weight of evidence received by the government legislation will be required before any change can be made and therefore the house will have every opportunity to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord enlarge on the question of research <e> <s> is it not a fact that there is some difficulty because the responsi <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the letter issued in from the office of the leader of the opposition then mrs margaret thatcher <e> <s> she said that the three emergency services should be taken outside the arena of public squabbling over pay and should have firm and automatic links to national pay rises <e> <s> are we to understand that the prime minister has now changed her mind or is this another example of disagreement within the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that rather predictable reply <e> <s> will the government take on board the importance of keeping political independence in scientific research <e> <s> can he say that the government will be quite sure to consider that centring any such political research in a government department would make it vulnerable to political pressure <e> <s> is that one of the considerations about which the government are thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is a misunderstanding of my supplementary question <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the government were directly putting on political pressure <e> <s> i was asking the government to consider that in the future it would be better not to have any research body centred in a government department because it would be vulnerable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has done his usual comprehensive job in presenting our report <e> <s> indeed he leaves very little for other members of the committee to say on it <e> <s> i thank him for the way in which in his capacity as chairman of the committee he conducted the inquiry <e> <s> he is a constant inspiration to the members of his committee <e> <s> his tact and patience with those of us who may not see the point quite so quickly as he does is commendable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however is he not aware that the proposals have been agreed by all parties and have gone to the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> will he therefore give us some idea of how long he expects it to take for the secretary of state for wales to make up his mind bearing in mind that this site was first identified in in the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> is this not far too long a time for such a valuable reserve to remain unprotected <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the work of friends of the earth which is based on government figures and which shows that expenditure of billion would produce savings in energy consumption of billion <e> <s> has the minister absorbed these figures <e> <s> is there any response to them <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as the th speaker in this debate i count myself very lucky that there is one point left of all the arguments with which i set out this morning which has not been touched on <e> <s> i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> perhaps i can just emphasise one or two points which have already been covered <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for introducing this topic and for doing so in such a comprehensive way <e> <s> it seems that almost every week some new disaster looms and we are obliged to think in terms of even greater environmental protection <e> <s> that should be a common goal for all of us regardless of race creed or political outlook <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister but is he aware that i have had a similar reply about twice a year for the last four years <e> <s> is he aware that over three-quarters of our commons which are very precious to most of us are at risk under the present legislation <e> <s> i understand that agreement with the moorlands association on the last outstanding argument was reached at the end of last summer <e> <s> will the minister say why more priority cannot now be given to this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords has there been a change of policy on the return of waste <e> <s> my understanding is that although the option to return it has been in existence on contracts for reprocessing carried out until now that option has not been exercised <e> <s> will the noble viscount please confirm that there is a change of policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to clear up a small misunderstanding <e> <s> i am perfectly well aware that thorp is not yet in operation <e> <s> however my earlier question referred to bnfl which has been reprocessing spent fuel for years <e> <s> am i correct in my understanding that when it had foreign contracts it did not return the waste <e> <s> i asked about a change of policy for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends on this side and others have made our feelings very clear regarding the dissolution of the cda <e> <s> i do not propose to go over the matter again except to say that i share their dismay and disappointment at the situation in which we find ourselves this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the intention of the bill <e> <s> when in september the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer was signed by participating countries it was accepted as a considerable step forward <e> <s> however new scientific evidence soon made us realise that the protocol was not strong enough and that much more urgent action was needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the bill and therefore i listened with a certain dismay as the noble earl threw some doubt on its future <e> <s> i hope that his worst fears will not be realised and that the bills provisions can somehow be incorporated if not in this bill into some other bill <e> <s> i am advised although like the noble lord lord hampton i have not yet digested the bill which is in another place that this bill complements and improves the provisions of the governments environmental protection bill <e> <s> the bills broad principles which are set out in clause include the maintenance of essential ecological processes the preservation of genetic diversity and the sustainable utilisation of species and ecosystems <e> <s> they form a sound basis for conserving our natural environment and are a recognition of the need for environmental management which i believe the noble lord lord northbourne felt was essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> i am not quite sure what he hopes will result from keeping in touch with the waste paper merchants <e> <s> the city of cambridge set up a collection in response to government exhortations <e> <s> it now finds itself told by its merchants that the value has fallen from to then to and now to nothing <e> <s> is the minister aware of the damage that is caused by setting up the mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> however it is depressing that these sites were identified in but we are still apparently not in sight of a conclusion <e> <s> the minister has only mentioned skomer and menai but there are three other sites which have also been identified about which he said nothing <e> <s> will it take more years in each case or years consecutively to reach a conclusion on those sites <e> <s> how can we take the governments commitment to marine conservation seriously if they appear to put so little effort into the creation of marine nature reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that lundy has been designated a statutory reserve and is not a voluntary reserve <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one small point to what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that if the noble lord lord hatch is to bring the amendment back at a later stage he would do well to remove the word environment and specify the damage which he is trying to eliminate <e> <s> that might be helpful because there is something in what the minister said that almost everything we do damages the environment in one way or another <e>", "<cs> i welcome the amendment proposed by the noble baroness <e> <s> i understand that the use of cfcs in aerosols is very small <e> <s> as she said it would be a great pity to deprive those who need it of the facility <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is she familiar with the survey that has recently been published by the consumers association which shows very clearly that in the past year there has been a decrease in people paying dental visits <e> <s> the people themselves say that that is because of higher charges and check-up fees <e> <s> in view of the governments commitment to preventive medicine will they not reconsider the question of charges for checkups <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of juggling the figures can we not accept the word of per cent <e> <s> of dentists interviewed who said that the number of patients attending their surgeries has decreased dramatically <e> <s> can we not also accept that the patients themselves say that that is because of higher charges and check-up fees <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay tribute to the way in which the promoters approached the environmental problems which came to be recognised after the first sitting of the committee <e> <s> they seemed to me to approach them with imagination and great willingness <e> <s> i think that the scheme which was eventually produced for the environmentally sensitive part of the route should be a model to any others who are considering this sort of development <e> <s> i thank them for the work which they put into that and i hope that they will be able to carry out the whole scheme which they put to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on the timing of his debate and on the way in which he has introduced it <e> <s> i wish to make two comments about his opening remarks <e> <s> there is a different interpretation of the absence of government back-benchers in this debate <e> <s> it seems to me quite likely that there are not enough of them willing to support the governments policies who are prepared to stand up in the chamber and say so <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the pardon of the house <e> <s> among the points made by the conservative member who introduced that bill was the fact that while the bill that she was sponsoring was a useful addition to the law relating to dangerous dogs she still firmly held the view that a dog registration scheme was essential in order to enforce not only the existing laws but also the bill to which she was speaking <e> <s> i hope that that presentation is acceptable to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has chosen a very good time to introduce this debate <e> <s> when agricultural pressures are changing it is quite likely that more land will be available if necessary for forestry and other purposes <e> <s> i am sure that the debate this afternoon will be helpful to those who make the decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great difference between the figure that i have which came from the nature conservancy council and that which the noble lord has just given <e> <s> my understanding is that sites have been notified <e>", "<cs> the question is coming my lords <e> <s> if the figure of is correct with which we agreed have been designated why is there such a delay on the remainder <e> <s> i should like to ask in particular why there is a delay on the exe estuary <e> <s> there are no objections to the designation from anyone <e> <s> vet that site still remains to be designated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer which will be welcomed widely both here and in scotland <e> <s> however can he tell me whether yesterdays reply from his noble friend in the department of the environment which stated that planning authorities should ensure that special protection areas are treated as though they were already designated applies to scotland as well as to england <e> <s> if so can he say what is happening in the case of lurchers gully <e> <s> is that being given special treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that ornithologists recommend that supplies of <e>", "<cs> my lords is uk making any contribution to the week or is there not enough of the body left <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the thanks to my noble friend lady david for introducing the debate and for the comprehensive way in which she did so <e> <s> i have read the department of education and science document <e>", "<cs> my lords as the locality is likely to lose some of the benefits of toursim as a result of this development what investigations have been made about the effect on employment during and after the building of the installation <e> <s> will there be any permanent jobs to comfort the local residents <e> <s> will the installation be built by local labour or will people be brought in from outside <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us what mechanism will be available to ensure that grants are still available to landowners on either side of the estuary <e> <s> will he also tell us whether there will be co-ordination to ensure that the same level of grant is available on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the criticisms which have been levelled at this bill very much of it is to be welcomed <e> <s> waste products created by the human race are threatening to destroy the planet <e> <s> every country must learn to accept that fact and must accept its responsibility to deal with the problem to the best of its ability <e> <s> we may not be among the worst but we have still a long way to go before we can equal the best <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> does he not agree that there is increasing pressure for development on the coastline of england and wales and of ten in areas of natural beauty and of wildlife importance <e> <s> in view of the fact that the last review of coastal development was carried out in and that further sites have been identified by the welsh tourist board as being suitable for development do the government not agree that there is a need for a major review of the coastal conservation policy throughout england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the question of my noble friend lord graham of edmonton on whether the environmental impact assessment will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister said that the local community will be consulted what did she mean <e> <s> what method of consultation will be used <e> <s> it was not clear from her answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to persist but when the minister says patients does she mean patients in the hospital at that time or prospective patients <e> <s> how are they to be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord kimball for sponsoring this bill in our house and particularly for the way in which he has introduced it <e> <s> as he has said the bill involved a working party of the rights of way review committee <e> <s> taking part in the discussions were the national farmers union the country landowners association the british horse society and the ramblers association together with others <e> <s> they reached agreement in an astonishingly low total of four meetings <e> <s> it shows what can be done in a spirit of co-operation even on such touchy subjects as rights of way <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in december the countryside commission said in its pamphlet <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of the common land forum report which is outside the present dispute with the moorlands association <e> <s> i am asking whether any progress has been made on drafting legislation for that <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill deserves the support that it has received throughout the evening <e> <s> i shall refer to the amendment of the noble lord lord monson shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble viscount said that the government are keeping a close eye on the development of lean burn engines what exactly did he mean <e> <s> are they offering inducements for the development of such engines or is there some other way of keeping a close eye on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as this problem was first identified in is it not rather disappointing that the minister is still talking in terms of the future as regards chartering the research vessel <e> <s> i understood him to say that the department would charter a vessel for research <e> <s> however just over a <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> can he say whether among the answers from the local authorities there was any indication of their need for extra resources to meet the governments requirements published last year <e> <s> are the government aware of the need and do they intend to make any special arrangements for resourcing <e>", "<cs> i have but one small point to make <e> <s> i apologise if i am wrong in this but there appears to be a double negative in subsection of the amendment <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord norrie has said virtually all there is to say but i wish to support his amendments <e> <s> there is a need to overcome what appears to be the inadequate integration of ipc with environmental assessment <e> <s> he has given the reasons for that clearly <e> <s> there is also a need to ensure that national plans for the purposes of environmental protection should be subject to environmental assessment <e> <s> as the noble lord said at the end of the day if the quality of that environmental assessment is not good enough the whole exercise is worthless <e> <s> to that end we need an environmental assessment monitoring unit <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister a question about what he has just said <e> <s> at the beginning he said that we were prepared to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide provided that others did their share <e> <s> does that mean that if we are not satisfied with the share contributed by the others we shall not make any plans to reduce our output of carbon dioxide <e> <s> is the reduction suggested by the minister based on the present figure or on the figure in the year <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that point <e> <s> the minister will appreciate that if we have to wait to see whether others have done their share it means that we shall continue in our polluting ways until the year which is hardly desirable <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> in doing so i can do no better than quote from the nature conservancy councils document on the bill which has been sent to a number of noble lords <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> although i appreciate the limited areas in which the ncc is to be consulted i am rather disappointed at the governments attitude as indicated in the first part of the ministers reply that the ncc is just another body <e> <s> surely as the governments statutory adviser on conservation matters it requires special status <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the number of self-employed who have become bankrupt has risen steadily since the early s <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether those people go back onto the unemployment register or are they a helpful statistic for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make it clear that i speak for myself since this is a private members bill but i know that many of my colleagues support what i shall say <e> <s> i oppose the amendment and hope that the noble baroness will not accept it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord addington and others have made clear a small child can be injured by falling from a pony <e> <s> shetland ponies are notoriously unreliable <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will not accept the amendment because it would weaken the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not quite know how to confess this but as a child i rode an ass and an animal called a jennet which does not seem to be mentioned <e> <s> that is a cross between an ass and a pony but the other way round to a mule <e> <s> such animals can be very unpredictable <e> <s> they are accessible to children growing up in the sort of family with which i was brought up which owned miscellaneous animals <e> <s> i should like to feel that the provisions of this bill extend also to those animals <e> <s> i cannot agree with my noble friend and i hope that this amendment will be rejected <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend before he puts the amendment to the committee why he must press the amendment if he feels that foals are never likely to be ridden <e>", "<cs> the term make good has been used in legislation since so it is familiar to farmers and to local authorities <e> <s> it is understood to imply a reasonable restoration of the walking surface with an understanding on all sides that there is a degree of flexibility in that standard <e> <s> sometimes the path may be improved by making good and sometimes it may have deteriorated but that flexibility has been accepted <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gisborough is very persuasive <e> <s> nevertheless i am advised that this amendment would introduce a degree of ambiguity to the bill which would undermine the agreement which has been reached by the rights of way committee working party <e> <s> as we have just heard growing crops has been the main source of complaint and difficulty over the years <e> <s> the bill as presented gives a fair and acceptable way out of the difficulty <e>", "<cs> i should have said at the beginning of this exercise that as this is a private members bill i speak from this dispatch box on my own behalf and not on behalf of my colleagues <e>", "<cs> i must respond to the noble lord <e> <s> for once in my life i was not defending forests because i support the idea of a dynamic forestry industry and have done so for some time <e> <s> there are many reasons for supporting such an industry not least the fact that a young tree absorbs about per cent <e> <s> more carbon dioxide than a mature tree <e> <s> therefore there is a need to continue planting forests <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that full reply <e> <s> he raised some interesting arguments which i must confess i had not thought of <e> <s> i wish to consider carefully what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness will not accept this amendment <e> <s> it would seriously weaken the bill <e> <s> one of the enormous attractions of the bill as it stands is its simplicity and clarity <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson admires that in other legislation <e> <s> the introduction of the phrase without reasonable excuse would lead to endless arguments in the courts about what is reasonable and what is unreasonable <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale illustrated that <e> <s> we have to remember that we are legislating to save children from accidents <e> <s> the question of the owner of the horse is well covered in clause c which states <e>", "<cs> my lords possibly they both could be prosecuted but it is unlikely that prosecutions would be brought against an owner who was miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on report and i must press on and finish <e> <s> i believe i have covered all the points i wanted to make <e> <s> there is the question of opening the bill to abuse <e> <s> there are unscrupulous people who will use the phrase without reasonable excuse to avoid their responsibilities <e> <s> i ask your lordships once again to remember that we are legislating to protect children <e> <s> in that case we must do everything to keep the bill as straight simple and clear as we possibly can <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will not succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i speak for myself and not for my noble friends <e> <s> i was not present during the passage of the legislation on seat <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments expectation that the new councils will be ready to start work on st april <e> <s> if the answer is yes what steps are being taken to acquire and to finance the extra staff that will be needed <e> <s> is the minister aware that the worldwide fund for nature has calculated that in scotland alone a further million will be required this year to make the extra provision for staffing in april <e>", "<cs> my lords all the arguments against the amendment have been very clearly made on both sides of the house <e> <s> i wish to add one small point <e> <s> if we were to make this amendment the next one or the one after that to the bill its chances of surviving in the commons would be nil <e> <s> i understand that the time allowed for the bill is very limited and that if we put forward arguable amendments of this kind it will be talked out in the other place <e> <s> therefore we need to know that the amendment we are passing is absolutely essential <e> <s> i do not believe that this amendment falls into that category <e>", "<cs> i have added my name to four amendments in the group three were spoken to by the noble lord lord chorley and one was spoken to by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> i shall be brief because all the points have already been made <e> <s> however i wish to emphasise two of them <e> <s> first the governments response to the carver recommendations on countryside issues and the joint committee was that the recommendations imply a potentially huge extension of the role of the joint committee <e> <s> as was pointed out by the noble lord lord chorley that is not so because few countryside issues would have a uk dimension <e> <s> it is to tally illogical to leave that responsibility outside the role of the joint committee <e>", "<cs> i wish to address most of my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> zma <e> <s> it is an attempt to put into effect the recommendation of the carver committee set out at paragraph <e> <s> the paragraph states <e>", "<cs> although the guarantee of ring-fencing is introduced in the ministers amendment the level of resourcing is not fixed <e> <s> it is that about which i am anxious <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies does he recall that i asked on monday whether the government expected the new country councils to be ready to operate on st april <e> <s> i pointed out that it was estimated that considerably more staff would be needed in advance of that date <e> <s> can the minister say whether staff are being recruited and whether the government are making extra money available to take on these new members of staff <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ross withdraws his amendment if that is his intention i remind the minister that it is a year next wednesday since the announcement was made <e> <s> when were the investigations put in train <e> <s> when were the consultants employed <e> <s> how long has the investigation been going on <e> <s> it seems to me that weeks after the announcement by the secretary of state we should have more information <e> <s> it is unthinkable that we are still in such a vague state <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> if these amendments are not accepted the work of the countryside commission and the new countryside councils will be confined simply to preserving the natural beauty of landscape <e> <s> these bodies would be precluded from a wide variety of activities to enhance the landscape such as amenity tree planting and the creation of community parks improving the community forests around cities and towns and grant aiding country parks <e> <s> i am sure that this omission must have been an oversight <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept these two amendments <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment for all the reasons that the noble lord has given <e> <s> it seems to me that the matters for discussion are similar to those raised during the passage of the water bill <e> <s> at that time the government were sympathetic to the principle <e> <s> i hope that they will extend that sympathy to the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> the use of private bills as development measures has increased dramatically in the past few years <e> <s> it has been remarked on many occasions that by such a measure proper investigation of possible environmental damage is often avoided <e> <s> i believe <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord could speak more slowly <e> <s> i cannot understand the gist of what he is saying <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply to amendment no <e> <s> c was even more complicated than my introduction of it <e> <s> i shall need to read very carefully what he has said <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> b we should have used may instead of shall <e> <s> however i wish to look at that matter again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the reply of the minister appears to meet the requirements of amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble and gallant lords amendment perhaps i may add that the future of the marine nature conservation review is not clear <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister can give an answer on that point to night <e> <s> the position is not helped by uncertainty over future funding <e> <s> since so many marine conservation matters cross country borders it is essential that there should be a great britain overview <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendment gives the alternative <e> <s> it says or the joint committee <e> <s> presumably the joint committee would only exercise its authority or function when it appeared to be necessary to do so <e> <s> one would hope that the country councils would act properly in respect of marine nature matters as i am sure they will in everything else <e> <s> but i think that as a reserve power this is a very useful measure to include in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers answer on the marine nature conservation programme <e> <s> however as he would expect i was disappointed by his reply to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> however at this late hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support <e>", "<cs> i support amendment no <e> <s> a together with the amendment to it proposed by the noble lord lord mancroft <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has told us of the governments latest consultation paper <e> <s> i welcome much of what has been proposed in that paper particularly with regard to the tightening of legislation already on the statute books <e> <s> however there is still no satisfactory way of enforcing measures to deal with the serious problems associated with dogs <e> <s> the amendment proposes a scheme that will help to solve the problem <e> <s> it will not solve it completely but it will help <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord will feel differently when we have reached the end of the debate because there are many more points to make <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley told us that registration would be a self-financing scheme <e> <s> that is a great attraction <e> <s> it would not call on government funds the local authorities would administer the scheme and they believe that it is practicable <e> <s> many have written to us to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords does the departure of mr nicholas ridley remove one of the obstacles to our joining the erm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer which is similar to the one which i was given by the noble lord lord reay in april <e> <s> since the designation of the exe estuary has not been objected to can the noble lord tell us what conflicts or problems in the inter-departmental consultations have made it impossible to declare designation three months after april <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although these sites are protected as sssis the value of an international designation is that it allows formal consultation between other countries and an exchange of experience and expertise <e> <s> that is important not only in terms of learning from other countries but in offering our expertise to them <e> <s> is it not therefore a matter of some urgency that we get on with this designation and indeed with all the others <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the playing of war games in the lake district in particular is causing a great deal of distress to local residents <e> <s> does the minister not consider that it is an unsuitable activity for national parks <e> <s> while one sympathises with farmers who wish to diversify should such games not be kept as far away as possible from areas of beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords before i acknowledge that answer perhaps i may welcome the noble lord on his first appearance with his new brief <e> <s> i look forward to a long and harmonious relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether her figure of million for includes the provision of a headquarters building for the jncc <e> <s> if not can she say where the jncc will be situated <e> <s> will the staff all be in one place or spread around <e> <s> may we have some idea of what element of the figure given reflects the cost of establishing the jncc <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that not unexpected answer <e> <s> will she accept that on a visit to skomer earlier this year i learnt of the damage that had been done during the long consultations about the second marine nature reserve <e> <s> will the government consider simplifying the consultation procedures in order that the whole process may be speeded up <e> <s> will they also consider having a single by-law-making authority because difficulties arise in that regard once an area is designated <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee f i should like to take this opportunity to thank the noble earl for his inspiring chairmanship of the committee during the preparation of the report <e> <s> i can assure the house that noble lords who have already expressed humility in the face of his expertise are not alone indeed a few members of the committee felt just the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put my name to the amendment and also to the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord norrie because i believe that either of those options would be better than the provision in the bill <e> <s> the arguments for widening the remit of the council seem overwhelming <e> <s> they have been debated so often that i do not propose to do so again <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph b of the governments amendment states <e>", "<cs> my lords against all the odds i still support the concept behind these amendments <e> <s> i appreciate that the arguments have been debated on a number of occasions and the subtleties of this group of <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am disappointed in that reply <e> <s> moreover the noble lord did not indicate to me exactly where i was wrong in what i said <e> <s> i believe that the report of the common land forum was published in or thereabouts and consultations have been taking place since that time <e> <s> the latest information i received indicated that the only sticking point was the moorlands association <e> <s> i really do not see that the statement which was made in a written answer on th july added anything to the matter indeed i could not find anything new in it <e> <s> however i leave the point for now <e> <s> since there is possibly just one further year left of the present government i hope that we shall have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his intervention <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the letter of intent which the noble lord lord walpole was kind enough to let me see <e> <s> it meets all the problems which are likely to arise but it would be helpful if the minister could reassure us that it will not be weakened by any further discussions <e> <s> there are a number of areas in which it could do with being strengthened rather than the opposite <e> <s> however i am sure that it is not meant in that way and i welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i suggested that the minister might abuse his powers <e> <s> the suggestion behind the amendment is simply that consultation should take place in order to ensure that standardisation that is an unpleasant word to use in conservation terms <e> <s> we are concerned that standards should be applied equally across the three countries <e> <s> much of our debate has been concerned with this and the amendment would have helped to ensure that there was adequate consultation where possible <e> <s> i do not see that in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most encouraging mini debate <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords who have made contributions and also to the minister for her reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up one point made by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> i have learnt from a number of unconnected sources that a majority of staff within the ncc at the moment would welcome a delay so that they might see the finished proposals for staffing and be aware of the picture as a whole before they had to implement them <e> <s> it is the feeling of a very large number of staff including some senior members that it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to be up and running by st april <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which i support would be welcome to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to go over the bill again <e> <s> however i wish to pay a personal tribute to the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> she was thrown in at the deep end and she swam very ably <e> <s> ministers in this house are always courteous but the noble baroness has mastered the supreme courtesy in that she appears to take ones arguments seriously <e> <s> even better than that she always produces what seems to be a sensible answer which shows that she has listened to the points that have been made <e> <s> i commend her for that <e> <s> i hope that she remains in her position for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer but naturally i am disappointed by it <e> <s> i had hoped that in view of the changing world circumstances the ministry might have thought again <e> <s> does the minister realise that that installation will be visible from the whole of the coastal path around st davids head that that is a national park that the entire population of st davids is up in arms against it and that apart from the health risk there is a great fear that it will have a destructive effect on tourism which is one of the great industries of that part of the country <e> <s> is it too late to ask the ministry to think again <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that if a review of the present lists were accompanied by improved monitoring the result would be very acceptable to the rspb <e> <s> that has long stressed the need for continued monitoring of the species on the list of pests <e> <s> the rspb take a sensible view about the need to control certain bird species <e> <s> however the necessity to re-examine the list is illustrated by the fact that golden plovers for example can be shot by someone without a licence and those birds are now becoming very rare <e> <s> whatever happens about the list generally can she assure the house that there will be continuous monitoring of birds which are either included or excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble lord lord stanley of alderley in his motion to send the matter back to the house of commons once more for the reasons which he gave <e> <s> there are two main reasons why the governments alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he mentioned my earlier contribution <e> <s> is he aware that the northern ireland scheme is not a registration scheme <e> <s> it is a different scheme <e> <s> is he aware that even in the troubled conditions of northern ireland the scheme is deemed to have been a success <e> <s> there has been a great reduction in the number of road accidents caused by stray dogs and other improvements <e> <s> in northern ireland it is felt that the scheme is successful <e>", "<cs> my lords before i turn to the environmental matter which most concerns me i should like to pick up a point made by the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> he was kind enough to refer to the traffic scheme proposed for cambridge <e> <s> i hate to disappoint the noble lord but that particular traffic scheme caused a public outcry <e> <s> i believe a lot of it is about to be dropped <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name is not on the list of speakers i shall be very brief <e> <s> it is obvious from the quality of discussion this afternoon and from the number of questions and arguments that have arisen that the bill is very important for scotland <e> <s> i look forward to developing some of the arguments and answering i hope some of the questions at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords planning legislation is the ultimate expression of any governments attitude towards the environment <e> <s> if the provisions in legislation are sensible clear comprehensive and are supported by strong sanctions against abuse then it can be assumed that the intentions of the legislators are firm clear and determined <e> <s> general statements of intent are all very well but it is the planning system which has to guide development settle conflicts and ultimately ensure that we live in a sympathetic environment whether that be in the town or in the country <e> <s> in our over-crowded country it is planning control or lack of it which will determine our landscape our supporting infrastructure and even the survival of our wildlife <e>", "<cs> my lords do we have a programme for monitoring co <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer my question about monitoring arrangements <e>"]
