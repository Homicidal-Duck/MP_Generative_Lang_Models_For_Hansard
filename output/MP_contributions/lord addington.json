["<cs> my lords i am honoured to be addressing this august and noble assembly and only hope that what i shall say will be of the high standard which your lordships have come to expect <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> before i go any further i feel that i should declare an interest because i am currently attending aberdeen university <e> <s> as a student in scotland i am aware that the bill will reduce my fellow scottish students income <e> <s> the sums which will have to be paid according to government estimates vary considerably depending upon where one happens to be <e> <s> fortunately in my case in aberdeen the charge will only be but in edinburgh it could be <e> <s> although those sums may not seem large they represent a considerable chunk of the average students income especially if he is dependent upon a full grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already given to the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> our education system is unusual in the amount of freedom that is allowed in individual schools no matter what they teach or the manner in which they teach it <e> <s> this system is about to undergo a radical change <e> <s> we are to have a national curriculum which will in effect lose some of the flexibility which has been a major strength in the present system <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches believe that this bill is disappointing <e> <s> it is one of the most disappointing bills brought forward by this government <e> <s> it is disappointing because they could so easily have produced a bill which could have gained widespread all-party all-section support based upon a desire to give parents a wider involvement in the education of their children <e> <s> such a bill would have created a partnership in schools between teachers parents and the community <e> <s> it would have benefited children and would have been welcome throughout scotland by all parties and all those involved in education <e>", "<cs> my lords instead a school board should be created which is a true partnership between the headmaster staff and parents as well as involving students to an extent and the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the essence of this amendment is to try to create a situation of partnership between the parents and those others involved in school boards that is the co-opted members and the teachers <e> <s> the idea of the partnership is based on balance <e> <s> having one group or other dominating the board by having an overall majority would really go against the idea of balance <e> <s> it has already been noted that there is a danger of a parental majority which has certain strong views gaining control of a school board and thus being in a position to put forward its own fads and fancies on various topics within education <e> <s> that would be a danger even if it were not a group dominated by some sort of ideology whether it be religious or political <e> <s> in addition teachers are trained in education theory knowledge and practice <e> <s> parents are not and they may not know the up-to-date thinking on various educational matters <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a teacher who is also the parent of a child at the school at which he teaches will have the option of standing for election to the school board <e> <s> the amendment is tabled on the grounds of fairness <e>", "<cs> i regret that the minister cannot accept the arguments put forward <e> <s> although i accept that people would join boards on a voluntary basis there may be cases even if they are few and far between in which someone will have to forgo attendance on financial grounds <e> <s> the point has been made about the amount of time spent in travelling especially in rural areas and the time taken in order to attend meetings <e> <s> that point should be borne in mind <e> <s> however as the government are not prepared to accept this amendment i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself agreeing with much of what has already been said <e> <s> the idea of partnership is what fundamentally lies behind both amendments <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael seems to encapsulate it rather better than that under my name on the grounds that it does not state an absolutely fixed position and that the flexibility therefore will enable us to adapt to any future change <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the privatisation of water in relation to the huge problems of the environment the government should surely be taking more positive action to combat the harmful effects of industrial waste for instance in all its guises and the raw sewage that is being pumped into our coastal waters which makes many of them well below ec standards while also setting in motion a comprehensive energy <e>", "<cs> my lords the general heightening of awareness of environmental issues especially in the political sphere is perhaps best illustrated by the prime ministers recent statements about the finite period of time that we have on this planet and our duty to all future generations to leave this world as a fit place to live in <e>", "<cs> my lords why is there a problem in recruiting teachers <e> <s> to find the answer we must surely look at the job itself and the rewards that are offered for it <e> <s> we all know from personal experience some of us rather more recently than others how children behave or misbehave in the classroom <e> <s> there is an obvious correlation between the behaviour of a class and the effectiveness of a teacher in doing his job <e> <s> that is teaching in order to impart knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords if our water is so safe why do we have an unpleasantly high increase in bottled water sales <e> <s> further are not people not in my native area of norfolk quite right to be worried about the levels of nitrates in their water which have been on numerous occasions well above the milligram limit <e>", "<cs> my lords if the level of financing is not to be increased dramatically will the government give us some assurance that there will be consideration of the regional elements which will mean that people in some parts of the country usually the less prosperous parts will be considerably better off than those in others <e> <s> will regional help be available for those in areas other than london <e>", "<cs> my lords when considering the problem of higher education one should perhaps first try to consider its objectives <e> <s> they should include some combination for the imparting of practical skills in such areas as science and medicine encouraging research and while trying not to sound too pretentious expanding the mind to give a degree of control and discipline that will be useful in later life <e> <s> i remember the old saying that what is important in education is that which remains when what has been taught is forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the privatisation of water we are surely considering a more fundamental privatisation than any that has gone before for the simple reason that drinkable water is as important to life as breathable oxygen <e> <s> possibly it should be thought of in something like the same light <e> <s> the first consideration of any government when dealing with water is the fact that we should have a clean and ready supply of it because it is so important to the health of the nation <e> <s> many noble lords have reminded us of joseph chamberlain and his work in cleaning up the water supply of birmingham <e> <s> we can look at other historical figures such as chadwick in london <e> <s> those two men probably made a greater contribution to the health of the nation than any doctor or combination of doctors <e> <s> if one stops such a major source of infection as dirty water one effectively takes on the nations health at first hand and prevents a deterioration through further major infection <e>", "<cs> if we are considering such a fundamental environmental point as the polluter pays we should try to get this into perspective <e> <s> this is a great way of saying that if someone damages the environment that is the environment as a whole not just individuals and not just the pollution of water and something as valuable to our country as a river ecological system where the whole system may be damaged there should be some way of ensuring that at the very least those responsible do not profit from the damage <e> <s> if we can safely say that people who do the damage must at least meet the cost of making the damage good that would be a sound thing to have in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am in favour of the list or plan which the noble lord lord mcintosh referred to for the simple reason that it reduces the amount of confusion over what the national rivers authority is supposed to do <e> <s> i do not believe that we have yet defined the purpose of this body other than with a general heading <e> <s> i believe that something that gives more direction and purpose would be extremely useful <e> <s> as regards the items themselves there is no reason why these should be the finite version <e> <s> there is certainly room for altering them over a period of time <e> <s> i believe that some kind of plan along these lines would be beneficial <e>", "<cs> i should merely like to say that it is reasonable that those on low incomes should have special representation <e> <s> as has already been said by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton a much greater proportion of these peoples income is being taken up by essentials <e> <s> thus if they have to meet the costs of such a basic commodity as water consideration should be given to them in some way <e>", "<cs> this amendment effectively works on two levels <e> <s> first it allows the public to know what is going on within the bodies <e> <s> secondly it makes sure that the environmental consequences are never completely squashed by those that are connected with the more directly financial parts of the companys activities <e> <s> thus i wish to support the amendment because if the bill is to be truly environmentally sound we must never lose sight of the fact that there must always be environmental considerations in it <e>", "<cs> the object of this amendment is to make sure that general water quality in all its facets is put down as a totem as early as possible and for that to be included in clause <e> <s> however as the hour is late and i am fatigued i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a message from the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that he regrets that he is not able to be here at this late hour but that in view of the debate he has decided not to move amendment no <e> <s> a at this stage <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i should prefer stronger wording about protection of the environment throughout the bill so i cannot pretend to be completely happy with the ministers response but i am prepared to accept it at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when considering such a wide sphere as archaeology it is right that we should take special account of it as regards the amount of damage which can be done to an archaeological site through for example the lowering of a water table or excavation work <e> <s> i should like to endorse without exception everything that the noble lord lord mcintosh said <e> <s> moreover i should like to reinforce what he said by making this point <e> <s> in a nation such as ours where so much of our history is of the non-written type that is we have cultures which dominated our history for example the ancient celts and the early saxons who did not have a written culture it is basically taught to us through archaeological finds <e> <s> thus i think it is most appropriate that we should take every step we can to ensure that most of these archaeological finds are kept in as good a condition as possible <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting and beneficial debate <e> <s> i hope the committee agrees with me on that <e> <s> the minister has met me some of the way and has given what i think i can describe as a broad undertaking to make sure the problem will not get out of hand and that it will be dealt with <e> <s> i wish to draw attention to the fact that there is more than just the acidification of water in question here <e> <s> the environment around water areas should also be considered <e> <s> i hope that that will be dealt with in the code of practice <e> <s> however with the assurances i have been given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having heard what the minister has said i think he is rather ignoring the fact that this is a permissive duty <e> <s> it would merely help the national rivers authority and other groups working for the authority in their duty <e>", "<cs> my lords polytechnics are undoubtedly a vital part of our higher education system <e> <s> however they suffer from one fairly unique problem <e> <s> they lack status in the current system <e> <s> why do they lack status <e> <s> i gave this considerable thought and came to the conclusion that possibly people think that their degrees and diplomas are not of quite such a high standard as those of universities <e> <s> i then turned to the handbook of the council of national academic awards and found in section ai this statement <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> za as well as amendment no <e> <s> a standing in the name of my noble friend lord ezra <e> <s> the first amendment has been very well covered by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i wish to reiterate his remarks to the extent that local authorities still have a considerable number of professional people who are qualified to deal with environmental health and other environmental matters through the environmental health officers <e> <s> they will also probably have ready access to such facilities as laboratories for testing <e> <s> so it would seem to be rather silly for them to be excluded to any great extent from the actual enforcing of environmental conditions <e> <s> also cases of unwholesome water affecting the areas they represent are certainly their concern <e>", "<cs> this amendment will effectively make sure that the local authorities register what goes on with water especially when something goes wrong <e> <s> also public access will be available to that information <e> <s> i cannot see any real harm being done in having this new clause as part of the bill <e> <s> surely the people who drink the water have a right to know if there is something going wrong with it <e> <s> also a local authority is a tier of local government that is very close to the people and is probably the best organisation to make sure that the appropriate information is available <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i believe that we have here the nub of the argument with regard to this group of amendments <e> <s> we are talking about how effective the consumer committees can be <e> <s> if there is any limitation regarding whom they can go to with any complaints we place a serious restriction on them <e> <s> if they are to be truly effective they must have the ability to go to whomsoever is considered appropriate with whatever complaint or question they have <e>", "<cs> i wish to add my support to the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> in doing so i should like to reiterate much of the sentiment contained in her speech <e> <s> the customer service committees are the effective redress between a monopolistic supplier and the consumer <e> <s> water is a natural monopoly <e> <s> there must be some redress for the consumer <e> <s> the voice of the consumer should be as independent as possible and should have as much access to the public as possible <e> <s> i wholeheartedly agree with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall refer to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i cannot see any objection to having the timetable <e> <s> we are trying to bring ourselves up to a standard <e> <s> we are setting ourselves a timescale within which to reach a standard <e> <s> it is a generous timescale as the noble lord lord mcintosh said <e> <s> the point that strikes me is that if we are part of the ec we should surely take every opportunity to bring ourselves up to ec standards <e> <s> in order to ensure that we must have a timescale in which to do it <e> <s> we from these benches are keen about the ec and thus we believe that this measure is wholly commendable and we give it our full support <e>", "<cs> we on these benches wholeheartedly support the sentiments encapsulated within this group of amendments <e> <s> it seems absolutely ridiculous to be enabled to cut off such a basic natural resource as water which is essential to all forms of life <e> <s> as has already been stated it is virtually impossible to live in anything like a vaguely civilised manner without water <e> <s> i can only say that we shall give our full support to the amendments if they are put to a vote <e>", "<cs> having heard what the minister has said i am happy to withdraw the amendment as he appears to have accepted the point that any breach of consents should be punished <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having heard what the noble lord said i see that the only course of action on this occasion is to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lords answer was full and listed many regulations and bodies which are dealing with the problem <e> <s> but the great number of them probably points to one of the problems here <e> <s> there are many bodies and much permissive legislation <e> <s> there are a great many people trying to deal with the problem <e> <s> the aim of the amendment was to try to give some cohesion and base to it to bring all the relevant people together and to give some kind of plan and structure to it <e>", "<cs> having listened to what has been said by the minister i am not entirely happy with the situation <e> <s> i still feel that there should be a right to have a full breakdown <e> <s> however as there is an error in the drafting of the amendment i should like to read what has been said and reserve the right to return to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we on these benches whole heartedly support the amendment and the sentiment behind it <e> <s> effectively as a cabinet minister the secretary of state should have great responsibilities for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of our rivers in order to bring them back to the highest standard possible <e> <s> it is altogether appropriate that the power is constituted at the very centre of government <e>", "<cs> although i appreciate that there would be considerable difficulties with this provision i wish to point out that by a pond i mean something which contains a considerable ecosystem <e> <s> i do not mean the glorified puddle with two carps sitting in it that occurs in many suburban back gardens <e> <s> although i accept that it is quite possible that this amendment may be drawn far too widely i wish to press the minister a little further <e> <s> i hope that he can give me a more specific and possibly more direct assurance that these vital parts of the rural environment will be given more protection in future <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> za which stands in my name and which is grouped with that of the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that all those who have an interest in or knowledge of a particular waterway will be consulted <e> <s> that would not be limited to those who have an interest in wildlife and the environment although that is of prime importance but would include sportsmen those interested in yachting boating or angling <e> <s> they should also be consulted <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support for this amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> aba says virtually the same thing as the amendment that we are now discussing and i should like to follow the lead of the noble lord lord norrie by entering the discussion at this point <e> <s> briefly i too regard the present classification as being the acceptable minimum at the moment <e> <s> any change in the water standard should be a positive one <e> <s> we should not allow any degradation in the levels of water quality <e>", "<cs> as the minister has given such a favourable response and his assurance that he will take action along these lines i can do nothing other than to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> i live in norfolk and one can occasionally see on the broads some unpleasant messes appearing in the wake of cabin cruisers <e> <s> that cannot be helping the environment <e> <s> there is not only the effluent but the materials such as bleach used to clean the toilets on board the boats <e> <s> i suggest that such unpleasant cocktails going into a natural water environment should be stopped as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of the amendment and also speak to amendment no <e> <s> b which stands in my name <e> <s> my amendment seeks to do the same job <e> <s> it seeks to ensure that the fines imposed bite more heavily than those imposed at the moment <e> <s> as the noble lord has suggested on some occasions it may be more economically viable because of the low fines for someone to carry on incurring fines and not do anything about the problem <e> <s> that is unacceptable and something must be done extremely quickly if we are to have any impact on people who are deliberately making money out of breaking pollution regulations <e>", "<cs> having heard what the minister has said i see that the two measures are not necessarily compatible although the greater enhancement of the environment was the objective behind the amendment <e> <s> it is an objective that should not be ignored <e> <s> i accept that the amendment is inappropriate and thus i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am to an extent reassured by what the noble earl has said but he will understand that the basic theme behind the amendment is to ensure that nothing can get in <e> <s> i appreciate that much of this will be dealt with by the nra making sure that it gives careful consideration to consent <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to read what the noble earl has said at some considerable length before deciding whether to bring these amendments back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord gave me a very full and complicated answer and i should like the opportunity to study what he has said <e> <s> bearing that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i am still not per cent <e> <s> certain about this matter <e> <s> however in view of what she said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> b which is grouped with the amendment of <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> once again i must admit to a slight feeling of worry because i was specifically concerned about wildlife especially aquatic wildlife <e> <s> however i accept that the noble earl does not in any way wish to duck the responsibility <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> it is a sensible measure <e> <s> it will give the nra time in which to get its house in order <e> <s> there will then be no mixing of the poacher and gamekeeper principle <e> <s> the nra should be independent in all its functions if it is to have the maximum effect <e> <s> i therefore recommend that the amendment be seriously considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment for the simple reason that the four groups mentioned on the marshalled list are directly concerned in what the nra is doing that is ensuring water quality <e> <s> the conservation and environmental organisations surely should have at least a representative on this body <e> <s> i hope that there will be more than one <e> <s> the recreation and sports organisations have a direct role to play <e> <s> i suggest that in a bill dealing with the privatisation of water some provision should be made for the consumers of water to have some form of representation either from a consumer body or from some other body <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the evidence that we have already heard indicates that many areas of the land currently owned by water authorities could be vulnerable to commercial exploitation which may well result in damage to the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what the noble lord has said i am reassured to a certain extent that enough weight will be given to interests other than those of the undertakers <e> <s> i am nevertheless wary of the fact that greater emphasis is still given to them and that the element of balance is therefore not totally represented <e> <s> however at this stage i am not prepared to press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to what the minister and the noble lord lord renton have said i have come to the conclusion that the amendment is not as effective as it should have been and i am therefore prepared to withdraw it <e> <s> however the issue behind it of giving greater protection to sssis is one that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i still would have liked to see some local representation and someone lower down the scale being able to take this action <e> <s> however having heard what the minister has said i can see that we shall not get that concession <e> <s> i can only hope that the bodies in question will be rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support these amendments from these benches for the simple reason that as the noble lord lord mcintosh stated the public should at least have the possibility of being able to bring a prosecution against someone who violates river water quality <e> <s> as the new water companies will be private companies and will generate profits to shareholders they should certainly be subject to the same stringent standards as are placed upon any other part of the private sector that is concerned with water <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what the noble lord lord renton and the minister have said i accept that i do not have quite enough legal skill and that i perhaps should have taken greater care over the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> before i withdraw it i should like to say that there is still the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lady for a very careful reply <e> <s> as it was so full and complicated i shall have to take it away and study it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too spoke to this amendment when it was first brought forward <e> <s> i reiterate that we should do as much as we can to protect wildlife habitats particularly those in urban areas <e> <s> i spoke at some length about reservoirs in the inner london area which provide a considerable natural habitat and are beneficial to many forms of wildlife <e> <s> they also provide an amenity for the benefit of the residents of the capital <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment for the simple reason that a limited right of entry with an emergency provision is a sensible proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendments <e> <s> i believe that they are potentially of great beneficial effect to the environment in scotland as they provide a requirement for the scottish river purification authorities to promote nature conservation and the benefits for wildlife and the natural environment which should accompany that <e> <s> the amendments call for the public bodies in scotland to have the same duties and obligations as the nra has in england and wales <e> <s> thus one of the truly beneficial parts of this piece of legislation will be extended to the whole of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers response was helpful <e> <s> in the light of it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what i originally intended to say has already been covered <e> <s> however i wish to make one or two statements which i think are relevant to the discussion we have already had <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness mentioned that on many occasions the final fine tunings for other privatisations had not been mentioned at this stage in legislation <e> <s> however i suggest to the noble earl that there has never been a privatisation which can compare with this one <e> <s> we are breaking new ground because we are privatising a body which does not even have comparative competition in that water cannot be substituted by any other natural resource <e> <s> we are taking out of the control of the nation something which is absolutely vital to life itself <e> <s> as such i suggest we should have set new precedents and gone further and been more definite from the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add the support of these benches for this amendment <e> <s> when i first looked at the amendment i did not think that i should support it because i assumed that aquatic environment would include the land around the water <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton has just said the two are so closely linked that it is almost ludicrous to try and separate them <e> <s> however i then thought again <e> <s> i thought that aquatic environment could be far more narrowly defined as merely what is in or in direct contact with the water at a certain level <e> <s> for example i could see quite ridiculous arguments about what is the aquatic environment in a tidal river and whether it concerns the level of the river at low or high tide <e> <s> i suggest that to insert <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what the minister has said i am not completely happy <e> <s> however he has met many of the points which were raised <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the minister again i am not happy perhaps a little less happy even than on the last amendment <e> <s> however once again i feel that the answer has met many of the points or at least some of the more fundamental material of the amendment <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that the noble lord lord renton has not been damaged by drinking tap water <e> <s> the fact remains that there is the distinct possibility that he could be damaged one day <e> <s> the aim of the amendment is to ensure that wide access is given to people who feel that damage has been done to them <e> <s> i agree that there is always a slight danger that one or two lunatics will phone up the police <e> <s> i suggest however that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel rather chastened by that reply but having been given that assurance which is now on the record the amendment has served any purpose it might have had and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to rise to express my support for the noble lord lord mcintosh on this matter <e> <s> my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> for the simple reason that i too am unable to see why the government should effectively say thus far and no further <e> <s> the noble lord lord hesketh spoke about jewels in the crown <e> <s> i would suggest that we could do with a few more of those jewels in that particular crown <e> <s> we should not shut the door on any area of expansion in this section as we do not know what will happen in the future <e> <s> an area that is now not regarded as being of great natural beauty or as worthy of inclusion in a national park may be so regarded in the future <e> <s> i suggest that we should keep the door open to allow for future improvements and for any future steps towards greater conservation and greater protection <e> <s> i urge your lordships to support amendment no <e> <s> and to oppose these government amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the amendments for the simple reason that they seem to be fair and reasonable <e> <s> the fact that if too many owners were involved or there was an emergency the consents would not have to be sought should cover everything <e> <s> the owner should at least have the right to be consulted if somebody is going to enter his land <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh has already said tries to bring back what may be regarded as the status quo <e> <s> the new plcs are taking over the old water authorities plant and their responsibilities in regard to providing good water quality <e> <s> it would seem absolutely ludicrous if this continuity were brought into question by saying that there is a cut-off point for switching responsibilities from one to the other and that the creation of the new plcs produces entirely new entities <e> <s> effectively they will be run by the same people and with the same plant <e>", "<cs> my lords i originally supported the amendment which was rejected by the other place <e> <s> i supported it on the grounds that it would improve the standards of drinking water and that a certain standard would be met by a certain date <e> <s> the amendment was not about the privatisation of water it concerned the health of people who happen to be drinking water and the surety and safeguards that they would have for their health <e>", "<cs> my lords when it was first drawn to my attention that this short debate would be taking place what initially attracted me to it was the implied criticism of the new gcse exams and the fact that some preference seemed to be given to the old o-level and a-level type of exam <e> <s> i was interested in the debate because i have very recently finished the great series of exam-catching and pieces-of-paper-acquiring train that starts with o-levels and finishes with a degree <e> <s> my final degree was in history <e> <s> i can safely say that o-level history was undoubtedly one of the most boring parts of that procedure for the simple reason that we did not do much history but we learnt a hell of a lot of dates <e> <s> i can remember some extremely good card schools and noughts and crosses circuits going on at the back of the classroom because the teacher who was a very good teacher at a-level found himself merely dictating to us to try to reinforce the fact that we had to get enough dates down <e> <s> this point is one that should be remembered <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only endorse what has been said by the noble lords lord mcintosh of haringey and lord shaughnessy about the regulations and the report which i have looked through and which stated that they were not very good <e> <s> i found the fact that they came out a little too late extremely irritating to say the least <e>", "<cs> my lords the advantage of tax on tobacco and alcohol has two very good prongs to it <e> <s> one is that we generate more revenue and if it is used correctly it could certainly enhance the lot of those people who might in some way be damaged by the two substances <e> <s> there is a second prong that we restrict the consumption of those two substances <e> <s> the idea of a fund and the examples given were very enlightening <e>", "<cs> i wish to add the support of these benches to the amendment for a simple reason <e> <s> surely some period in which to consider opting out of local authority control would definitely be a good idea <e> <s> consultation with the other affected groups within the local area should take place and soundings could be taken of views of parents <e> <s> i suggest that this is a sensible move and a proposal which should have been included in the first place <e>", "<cs> i should like to add support to these amendments for the following reason <e> <s> if we are to give support to those who have special educational needs we must have facilities readily available to them <e> <s> if special schools become self governing we shall be stripping very important tools away from the local authoritys educational function <e> <s> the facilities must be readily available be they equipment or the training of staff <e> <s> if we allow such key elements in the overall picture of education to be taken away from the education authority or made less readily available we may commit a very grave error and waste a great deal of human resources <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the principle that a teacher should be trained in how to teach no matter what volume of knowledge he has is an important one although it is accepted that on some occasions people with certain specific technical knowledge but not qualified as a teacher will be required for short periods <e> <s> however i certainly support the idea that people employed on a full-time basis in schools within the education system no matter what kind of school it is should at least have some experience of being taught how to impart that knowledge <e>", "<cs> i wish to add my congratulations and i am very glad that such attention is being given to special needs as that has been an area of concern <e> <s> i am glad to see that that area is receiving the attention it deserves because anything which could cause as much potential trouble as special needs within a school deserves individual attention <e>", "<cs> i should like to add support from these benches for the proposal <e> <s> if the parents of a school make a decision that they would like that school to become self-governing they effectively have made that choice on the grounds of the school as it stands <e> <s> once the school is in being surely it should have time to settle down to allow its functioning to settle and then if changes are needed after that time and if they are of an important nature they should be made after due consideration <e>", "<cs> the amendment points out one of the gravest potential dangers of having opting-out schools the fact that schools were originally conceived to act in relation to a whole area <e> <s> if a school were to change itself in some way that could ultimately change the nature of the education system provided throughout the area since it might no longer be acting in concert with other schools <e> <s> there have been numerous examples of what could go wrong following various types of change <e> <s> we must remember that education works at a community level and schools must act in concert within that community <e> <s> on these grounds it is important that we give this amendment if not our wholehearted support at least very grave consideration <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> an element of individual liberty is involved here as well as confidentiality <e> <s> if people transfer to new employers who operate under different circumstances they have certain rights which should be safeguarded <e> <s> i suggest that this should be looked into very closely <e>", "<cs> on the composition of these proposed boards although employers have an interest in the colleges they are not the ultimate people concerned <e> <s> it is the students those who go through the education process <e> <s> many will undoubtedly be going into local employment <e> <s> many more may be regarding the courses that they are undertaking at college as a step to employment and further education in other parts of the country <e> <s> i suggest that to have too many local employers on these boards may make them too insular looking only to their own doorsteps <e> <s> if the students are to have their interests represented in the best possible sphere we must have people who are to a great extent removed from the immediate concerns of the employers although taking some account of them as is done when considering the question of college organisation <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> in the past when we have tried to determine admissions to schools by academic tests we tended to have rather mixed results <e> <s> indeed the old -plus examination is a classic case of people who had not developed educationally at the same rate as others missing out or people who showed early promise being in the wrong school <e> <s> i have certain reservations about a technology-based school but i support any move to make sure that admission will not be by an academic test which is <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> we appear to be reiterating arguments that we had earlier this evening in so far as no matter what a persons technical knowledge there should be some guarantee that he can impart that knowledge that is he has teaching ability <e>", "<cs> the problem is that the word testing is being used <e> <s> if we use the word assessment we might feel a little happier about it <e> <s> tests imply passing or failing although it is explained to us that this is not the purpose of the proposal <e> <s> children of this age cannot be judged as passing or failing <e> <s> they have different rates of development and different abilities <e> <s> can we have an assurance that this proposal is about assessment of the individual development of a child and is not about attaining some rigid and to be perfectly honest arbitrary level <e> <s> it may be argued that our whole education system is far too riddled with passing and failing <e> <s> can we have a guarantee that we are going for assessment and not a pass mark <e>", "<cs> this amendment seems to be sensible for the simple reason that a child who has special educational needs may well need the help and support of a parent when undergoing a particular programme of education <e> <s> i regard education as used here in the general sense of well being and even education in using certain motor skills within the childs own body <e> <s> i suggest that if this is required and we are supposed to be helping the children by assisting the parent we shall be helping the child <e> <s> thus it is a reasonable measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it is very simple and comes down to one principle that there is a certain stage at which a very small school will not be a feasible unit for governing itself <e> <s> it is just too small and the economies of scale will effectively be working against it <e> <s> thus i suggest that this is a very sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is sensible to provide for a minimum period of months before a school board can take such a big decision as to opt out of the local authority and the framework within which the school has previously existed <e> <s> the noble baroness said that school boards may well be capable of doing so but there is a danger that they will not be capable <e> <s> they will not know either way <e> <s> we are not saying that they will not be capable but that they should have an opportunity to find out for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment for the very simple reason that it enables parents who have to make a decision about the future of a school do so from a position of knowledge <e> <s> surely that is reasonable and essential if such decisions are to have proper grounding and a good effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment on the simple ground that public knowledge is generally a good thing <e> <s> anyone who is considering taking a decision to opt out or any decisions related to it should know what has happened before in other circumstances <e> <s> i suggest that the amendment is a good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these two amendments <e> <s> we have consistently supported the idea of there being more support and a bigger majority required for schools to change their status <e> <s> if there is a per cent <e> <s> vote with a per cent <e> <s> majority of those voting in favour only just over a quarter of the parents involved would be supporting this rather great radical change to the nature of the school <e> <s> surely some guidelines and safeguards are required on this issue so that there is not this danger of a minority making such a big decision <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i add our thanks for the courtesy and consideration which have been shown by the noble lord in the handling of this bill <e> <s> the bill deals with a concept which on these benches we find hard to stomach that is the fact that the local authorities of scotland will lose part of their educational structure for the assistance of pupils <e> <s> they can potentially lose part of the schools provision which now provides options for parents and for the authority <e> <s> however if it is to be that this bill has to pass i can only hope that we are wrong and that the government have the answers in a form that will help <e> <s> i do not think they have but i hope i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords waste recycling involves issues which run throughout the green debate and the whole environment <e> <s> effectively it can be seen as a microcosm of the recycling problem <e> <s> we are talking about the most effective use of our finite natural resources <e> <s> we could make far better use of materials such as the timber which goes into newspapers which we could re-use several times and the metal used in canning <e> <s> it has been estimated that per cent <e> <s> of aluminium can be recycled at only per cent <e> <s> of the energy cost <e> <s> such statistics make one realise how much we are throwing away and how much we could claw back <e>", "<cs> my lords when it was first suggested to me that the government would be introducing a student loan system i felt myself bound to oppose it on a matter of principle <e> <s> the principle is that a society which will benefit from people taking higher education through the study of subjects themselves and the practical benefits gained through the study of those subjects these benefits are often economic benefits should help everyone who wishes to enter higher education to do so <e> <s> this should be available as of right <e> <s> furthermore society should be prepared to pay for it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the sums but the spectre of debt which everybody here has been talking about the idea that one is going to incur a debt <e> <s> an extra debt on any course is what we are tallking about <e> <s> it is not the figures themselves but the idea <e> <s> the new groups that we should be trying to attract into the education system will be put off by this spectre <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord joseph introduced the new gcse exam he took a great step towards correcting one of the fundamental errors in our secondary education system the old two-tier system of cse and o-level <e> <s> the o-level tended certainly in art subjects to be far too much a case of regurgitating a series of facts and the cse exam was quite simply a sop exam for those who were not quite so good academically <e> <s> the fact that everybody will now be marked or assessed on the one exam is definitely a step in the right direction and one that i wholeheartedly support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord parry for bringing this matter to the attention of your lordships <e> <s> when considering this question i had to think long and hard about the changes that have occurred since the last war <e> <s> i must admit that i am at something of a disadvantage in this respect as i have not seen as many of those years as other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords a debate referring to international action for the environment is a very <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble baroness on her first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> although the market place is a very important factor in deciding who goes into employment does she agree that the government should make more resources available in terms of pay to encourage more teachers into the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble and gallant lord lord carver for introducing this report which even if it does not provide all the answers certainly provides most of the questions that we should be asking ourselves at this time on this truly global problem whose ramifications are ones which we cannot avoid or dodge for any great length of time <e> <s> if the greenhouse effect is to have a deleterious effect on us it will already have started to do so <e> <s> we shall not be able to do anything about those effects for some considerable time due to the problem of the oceans slow rate of warm-up and slow rate of cooling <e>", "<cs> my lords when i considered the subject brought before the house by the noble lord lord peston on the importance of education and training for the success of the economy and society i felt myself agreeing with his first sentiments that the two are so mixed as to be one <e> <s> if the economy does not work society will crumble <e> <s> therefore we must do something about the skill shortage especially a technical skill shortage when it is accompanied by a downturn in demography <e> <s> we are running out of young people <e> <s> the workforce is greatly reduced and so we must increase its training to ensure that there is less wastage <e> <s> we must also look to new sources of skilled workers <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill probably strikes at the heart of the environmental debate <e> <s> we are not only saying that we should do something but it gives us a timetable in which to do it <e> <s> on these issues there has been an unfortunate tendency for people to say that something should be done but here we are saying that it should be done within a given period and what will happen if it is not done in other words we are setting ourselves a series of standards <e> <s> there are not enough concrete suggestions and aims which we can fulfil <e> <s> in the environmental sphere there is far too much talk and supposed good intentions <e> <s> we must start taking more and more measures along these lines so that we have something at which to aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say not surprisingly that i shall be supporting my noble friends amendment <e> <s> when i initially read the bill i thought that i had only half of it as it was so small <e> <s> i have stated this on previous occasions in your lordships house <e> <s> since then it has not put on much weight <e> <s> we have had more information about what will result from the measure but not very much on the bill that we have to discuss a hands on issue <e> <s> we are discussing the future of this countrys knowledge base <e> <s> those people will be the basis for all forms of economic activity and social interaction in this country <e> <s> we are talking about their knowledge and training <e> <s> we should have more information on the bill that we can discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the noble lord lord raglan i have reached the conclusion that he knows far more about the process of planning authorities than i ever shall <e> <s> therefore i shall restrict my remarks to the function of the system as it stands <e> <s> a system that presumes the right to devleop must have strong bounds placed upon it if it is not to become a means of abusing the environment as a whole <e>", "<cs> i should like to support both the amendments <e> <s> the part-time student is regarded as something of a misplaced beast in universities <e> <s> everyone is glad to have part-time students there but they are not sure what they are <e> <s> they do not receive the full support that they should have <e> <s> anyone who takes on a course of part-time education i assume that about a third of it is course work takes on a commitment over and above those hours for the simple reason that he has to get himself to and from the establishment to attend certain lectures at certain times <e> <s> even when special evening classes are arranged these people will have to sacrifice a certain amount of time which may mean <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> the real issue here is that students who have entered on an undergraduate course prior to october will have done so through a system under which they have been funded by grants and not by loans <e> <s> therefore they may have made their assessments of going into education on different grounds <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment for the simple reason that people are studying to a degree level in a subject which is deemed to be useful and beneficial to society as a whole <e> <s> therefore it would seem only just that they should receive as much support as anyone else who is undertaking a similar course <e> <s> there are grounds for a certain amount of equity in the matter and i think that we should give these people that support <e>", "<cs> i wish to reiterate the last comments for the reason that under the current grant system people are expected to purchase a certain number of books <e> <s> it is accepted that students buy books <e> <s> it is realised by very many people that the current grant level means that students are almost totally dependent on the library <e> <s> the problem gets worse as students proceed with their courses because the books they have to buy become more and more complicated and specialist <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for my zealousness as a convert to the scottish education system having suffered under the a level system <e> <s> i am glad that the distinction between the two is being made clear <e> <s> a levels channel you very early into the specific subjects and you do not have much chance to break out especially if you follow a single honours course in england or wales <e> <s> the scottish system is nearer what we are told exists and i am glad to hear that it is receiving some consideration <e> <s> the noble earl did not put down a blanket shutter on any form of review in the future <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words to this discussion <e> <s> many acquaintances of mine and my brothers and sisters who have finished their first degree courses were confronted with the possibility of undertaking higher academic work <e> <s> many of them were worried about the financial problems that that implied and about the fact that they may not be suitable for a different type of academic work that was more research based <e> <s> surely a taught masters degree which provided some form of financial support so that they did not face quite the same degree of financial burden would be a good idea <e> <s> i am of course assuming that the government would not charge these students competitive interest rates but interest rates at the same level as those for undergraduates <e> <s> that would mean that these students would at least attempt to find out whether they were capable of undertaking higher academic work <e>", "<cs> i shall return to the amendment <e> <s> as many noble lords have said there is very little information in the bill <e> <s> many amendments which try to put in some information have been tabled <e> <s> students and their parents should know what the starting figure is to be <e> <s> they should know roughly on what terms the student loan scheme will operate <e> <s> they should know what they are getting involved in <e> <s> on those grounds alone we should have something in the bill that will tell us what will happen <e> <s> that information should be in the bill because it is the bill that counts as has been pointed out before <e> <s> on those grounds alone i support the amendment <e> <s> unless we have firm information we are merely saying yes get on with it in the hope that something certain comes back at the end <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble baroness i should say that in aberdeen accommodation was provided certainly for the first year students and generally for the second year for those students who needed it <e> <s> two years accommodation were provided in the private rented sector <e> <s> it is worth pointing out that anyone who is in housing provided by an education institution is invariably a lot better off <e> <s> it should be pointed out that those institutions and polytechnics which are less well endowed in their initial funding tend to be far harder hit in terms of accommodation <e> <s> someone who attends an institution of higher education in the south of england that does not have blocks of accommodation will find himself particularly hard hit because there will be no back-up and no subsidised housing <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble earls reply and i was amazed to see how well he manoeuvred under such heavy fire <e> <s> i proposed the idea with a view to those students who receive full grant and have the least financial support from the home background <e> <s> the idea of a regional policy has some p -ecedent because this government and other governments have accepted that it is more expensive to live in london <e> <s> there are housing and travel costs <e> <s> all large cities involve considerable travel costs and there are incredible variations in housing costs in many large cities <e> <s> thus once the housing benefit which ironed out those difficulties was removed we had to do something about bringing the situation back to a state of equilibrium in order to give support especially to those who have the fewest resources available to them and are most dependent on housing benefit <e>", "<cs> evidently the noble earl cannot say any more than that at this point <e> <s> this is a very important issue <e> <s> in the circumstances i am prepared to withdraw the amendment at this point on the understanding that the noble earl will come back and inform this chamber as soon as possible <e> <s> i categorically reserve the right to come back on this issue <e> <s> if there is nothing positive forthcoming let me assure the committee that i shall certainly raise this issue again and will not be put off a second time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> i believe that she has encapsulated perfectly the argument for this amendment <e> <s> if we are to have top-up loans which will never be more than per cent <e> <s> of the total amount of funding why not say that <e> <s> throughout the bill we have argued that more and more should be written into it so that we know what we are dealing with <e> <s> this is one situation where we should make the position absolutely clear to those involved and also place a limit on particular elements within the bill <e>", "<cs> i add the support of all on these benches for this group of amendments <e> <s> the amendments aim to give support to disabled people when they attempt to enter higher education <e> <s> if we are to make higher education available to all as the government have said i hope that they are sincere in that wish everyone should have access to it <e> <s> the disabled can contribute to our society provided that they have the correct training <e> <s> they often have to have the highest form of training to enable them to <e>", "<cs> i made similar points last week <e> <s> the problem is that no courses lasting more than three years were considered in the initial thinking or in the white paper <e> <s> the minister said that he would look into the problem <e> <s> i wonder whether any light has been cast upon it <e> <s> how have any ideas developed scotland will be hard hit <e> <s> i have gone on at some length about scotland previously and i shall not repeat the arguments <e> <s> the problems are fundamental because four-year courses do not come within the scope of the white paper <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord peston and also speak to my amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> the amendment is virtually self-explanatory <e> <s> it proposes that there should be no immediate access by the student loans company or the body which functions as that to the bank accounts of students or former students affected by the scheme <e> <s> that is to ensure that the student loans company does not have direct access to the money of those students who have gone through the system <e> <s> it means that the students can have some control over their own repayments <e>", "<cs> having heard the noble baroness lady david i must agree that i do not think anybody will make himself poverty stricken for a period of years to avoid repayments on these loans especially when we are told that these will not be very onerous repayments <e> <s> i wonder whether the two positions are not in contrast to each other <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to say that we seem to be covering much of the ground covered earlier today and the same arguments apply <e> <s> the real point here is that there will always be some people who will be better off those who manage to stay in university accommodation <e> <s> the students we should be worrying about are those who are in institutes which do not have accommodation and those who fall outside them <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the principle that i and the noble earl lord haig proposed is receiving <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my support and that of these benches to the amendment <e> <s> if we are to have top-up loans it is only right that we should say that they will reach a finite level as was originally set out in the white paper <e> <s> we are still discussing the ideas in the white paper or at least we are under that impression so it is only reasonable that this measure should be written into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my own support and the support of these benches for the measure <e> <s> the noble lord has given a fair summing up of the reasons why i feel that students who are attending an institution of higher education under the grant system and this scheme will predominantly affect those who are on full grants or in receipt of the higher proportion of grant should continue to receive their funding in that way as those are the terms on which they entered their course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to note that i have not been wasting my breath and that noble lords have been listening to me <e> <s> i can only welcome the extended repayment period though the fact remains that the money still has to be repaid

lords as always the noble earl has been most courteous and very precise <e> <s> i appreciate that the scottish students taking the standard four-year course will not be under anywhere near as much financial pressure as those on longer courses <e> <s> i do not believe anyone would argue that <e> <s> the answer given by the noble earl is probably as good as it can be <e> <s> i have been reassured by the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not totally happy with what the noble baroness said but she would not expect me to be <e> <s> my main concern is about the initial period <e> <s> i felt that after six months there would be a problem about people studying not paying interest on the amount of money they had borrowed <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i should have expected that answer <e> <s> we made a decision before that took into account the fact that housing benefit was the great equaliser throughout the system <e> <s> however i am rather disappointed that the noble earl did not say that he had another scheme to put forward <e> <s> i was under the impression that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to support these amendments <e> <s> it is very important that we set out that disabled students should not in any way be held back by disability <e> <s> all help should be given to them so that they have as good a chance as their fully able-bodied companions <e> <s>

asked me why i had not noted the number of year-old students in scotland since i had left university there only recently <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has given me more or less the same answer as i have been receiving the whole way through this discussion <e> <s> no further concession has been forthcoming <e> <s> he spoke about someone receiving a loan over a four-year period and receiving the extra years help in tuition fees and maintenance <e> <s> i should like to point out that scottish students have invariably spent one year less in school or have done so very often <e> <s> i should also mention the fact that the four-year course in scotland is based on the highers system <e> <s> it is a system which is non-specialist <e> <s> england is moving toward it and away from the specialisation of a-levels <e> <s> i suggest that we may face that problem in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> the points have already been made <e> <s> the disabled not only have a more difficult time as students but they have a far higher probability of being unemployed and a far less chance of earning very high salaries <e> <s> thus i suggest that it is only fair that they receive special consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have taken part in the debates on the bill <e> <s> i believe that we have helped to make it a more workable piece of legislation <e> <s> having said that i must say that i am still totally opposed to the principle behind it <e> <s> i believe that the idea of students paying in some way for their education in the form of a direct payment rather than through the tax burden which is placed on them is not an unreasonable one <e> <s> however this is not the way to go about it <e> <s> however it is the system that we are stuck with <e> <s> i hope that we have made improvements to the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord renwick for introducing the subject of

out from the start that i was one of the lucky ones <e> <s> it was spotted that i was dyslexic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the government have at least accepted the principle behind the amendment that was agreed by this house <e> <s> i am also pleased that they have now decided to take into account the great variety of students and of repayment systems <e> <s> i hope that any further and subsequent consideration of the bill and its consequences will take into account that one does not necessarily have to be disabled to receive such special consideration <e> <s> i hope this means that other aspects of the bill will be considered in a wide and open manner <e>", "<cs> in speaking on this debate i feel a little shy in coming to the fore <e> <s> not only am i very much younger and less experienced in the procedure of this house and also have no experience in the procedure of another place but also as a hereditary peer i feel that to a very great extent i shall be criticising

period of regarding it as something purely to be looked at in aesthetic terms <e> <s> we then start to appreciate its constituent parts its entity value <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> most of us object to the planting of trees or the churning up of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to address most of my remarks to dyslexic students while fully endorsing the comments on the difficulties of the deaf <e> <s> dyslexic students suffer from many of the same difficulties in that they have to take up more time and have more pressures placed upon them in completing their work units especially if they are in units where they must rely on dictated notes or notes written on a blackboard in technical subjects <e> <s> the reason is that dyslexics are invariably much worse at copying down anything which involves written symbols <e> <s> it does not need to be written language the difficulty involves written symbols <e> <s> they thus have a greater commitment on their time <e>", "<cs> my lords when i looked at this bill i rapidly came to the conclusion that it was one of the best and least contentious bills that i have seen since joining your lordships house <e> <s> the bill sets up workable rules by which farmers will know exactly what they have to do with footpaths and allows walkers to use those footpaths <e> <s> it also allows agricultural work to carry on <e> <s> it specifies for farmers exactly how long they can do such work and what they have to do after the work which has disturbed a footpath is completed <e>", "<cs> my

to speak briefly to amendment no <e> <s> but before doing so i should like to comment on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> as that point has been succinctly dealt with i should like to say that

it has been described as leg work <e> <s> if you are expected to do leg work it is only decent that you should know exactly what you are supposed to be doing <e> <s> a breakdown of functions should surely have occurred a long time ago <e> <s> we should allow local authorities to know what they should do to help those who are in a greater position of power and have a co-ordinating role <e> <s> i therefore recommend that amendment no <e> <s> at least should be accepted <e>", "<cs> i listened to the debate as it unfolded and it seems to me that the noble lord lord lucas has put his finger on a variety of points about the whole issue of consultation <e> <s> i should like to read what the noble lord said <e> <s> at this point i shall withdraw the amendment reserving the right to come back to this issue at a later date when i have studied what has been said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having heard the noble ministers reply i am more satisfied that the question of general public availability will be covered by the government <e> <s> bearing in mind that i should like to read what the minister has said to make sure that he has covered it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too should like to add support from these benches for the proposals as they are set out in the amendment <e> <s> we should have on the face of the bill at some point some form of declaration of intent and the ideology behind the bill so that we do not become too bogged down in regulations and basic statements of what is economically advisable and administratively possible <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart mentioned my speech <e> <s> i was assuming that all things are relative <e> <s> i assume that a comparatively small child would be on a comparatively small horse <e> <s> if that child falls off its delicate skull will strike the hard pavement <e> <s> one would be travelling at greater velocity than one does on foot <e> <s> i agree that there are some bad examples of childrens playgrounds which have been placed on concrete but all the new playgrounds are based on woodchip or some other soft material <e> <s> anyone who wishes to check that fact should go to a recently constructed park <e>", "<cs> any child should be told that it is breaking the law up to a certain age <e> <s> children are difficult at all ages <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson sounded rather like the reviewer of a s james dean film the term juvenile delinquent was writ large <e> <s> children misbehave and experiment with drink and drugs in their early teens <e> <s> however they are usually small experiments <e> <s> we could find cases of children doing so even at the age of five where they find a drinks cabinet open for example <e> <s> i hope that that argument will not carry any weight <e>", "<cs> leaving the ec aside as regards these amendments we come back to the point that this amendment is making an exception <e> <s> a foal can be a potentially large animal <e> <s> i am sure that those more knowledgeable on equestrian terminology will be able to find some very interesting definitions of the word foal and can find examples of enormous specimens <e> <s> a child can be hurt at an early age by falling from a considerable height from such an animal <e> <s> i suggest that we should make our definitions as wide as possible when dealing with safety regulations so that they can be applied as widely as possible <e>", "<cs> no but what happens when we do <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> it is sensible to have regard to anything that could happen when dealing with pollution problems <e> <s> to bring in the possible as well as the probable is surely the best way of doing that <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord <e> <s> an amendment to ensure that the code of practice is reviewed i hope that it will be reviewed periodically and to ensure the necessary resources to make it effective is sensible <e>", "<cs> the government should consider carefully the aim of these two amendments or at least the principle behind them <e> <s> ultimately the stance of preparing for pollution or taking active steps to prevent it will be a thousand times more effective than saying if you cause damage to the environment you will pay a price to put it right <e> <s> that is especially so when we consider that very often it is impossible to put right the damage caused especially not in the short or medium term <e>", "<cs> this amendment is stating something which must be obvious to all noble lords <e> <s> if we are going to ensure that all those involved in this activity are fit to do so then the people who are examining them in the first place must have sufficient resources available <e> <s> unless we can guarantee this type of provision there is absolutely no point in saying that we shall grant licences in the first place if one cannot check that they are going to be effective <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> ca <e>", "<cs> having heard what the minister had to say i am to a certain extent satisfied that the points are covered <e> <s> however i reserve the right to come back to the matter when i have read what he said and studied it at greater length <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the amendment was straightforward and innocuous <e> <s> i should like to read carefully what the minister said before deciding the eventual fate of the issue <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply hinges on the fact that he believes that consultation could lead to greater delay and to bureaucratic obstacles being placed in the way of the recycling process <e> <s> i agree that there is a danger of that but i also believe that there is a danger in not listening to all those concerned <e> <s> however i should like to study what the minister said before i decide what to do about the issue <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is another amendment primarily concerned with consultation <e> <s> the bill states that the authorities have a duty to consult those parties which are likely to be engaged <e>", "<cs> the answer which the noble lord has given is one that i anticipated <e> <s> such phrases tend to so water down a provision that it becomes virtually meaningless <e> <s> saying where reasonably practicable is like saying that something will be done provided it is not too much trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just one point to make <e> <s> i should say that i am no lawyer <e> <s> clause of the bill states <e>", "<cs> my lords we are going over a little of the ground that we have already covered in committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord monson said that he had not heard of anybody riding a foal <e> <s> he asked me at committee stage whether i had heard of anybody riding a foal <e> <s> i said no but that if i waited long enough i was quite sure that i should do so <e> <s> i am equally sure that there will be some idiot out there who is prepared to put a small child on a small animal a foal <e> <s> as i said before that damages the foal and we must think of protecting the animal as well as the child <e> <s> the likely result of a small child on the back of such a young animal is that the animal will dislodge the child <e> <s> there will thus be the situation of a soft skull meeting a very hard pavement <e>", "<cs> the minister has given me an extremely full reply and one which i must admit left me straggling behind him at certain points <e> <s> his speed of delivery probably represents a record for him and for this chamber <e> <s> i managed to glean that the situation has been noted and is in hand <e> <s> i should like to read what the minister has said <e> <s> while retaining the right to return to the point at a later stage if necessary i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to follow through a couple of the points which were initially raised by my noble friend lord russell <e>", "<cs> i give what support i can to the amendment <e> <s> much of what can be said has already been said by those who are expert in the field <e> <s> such a committee may not be necessary but it would be useful <e> <s> when it comes to those important issues the government cannot have too much advice and the debate cannot be public enough <e> <s> too many decisions tend to be taken behind closed doors <e> <s> there is always a danger of people looking for what they want to see from scientific advice rather than seeing what is actually there <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it is important to instil confidence with regard to public information <e> <s> as has already been stated ignorance is a great breeder of fear <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have discussed on previous stages of the bill it is right that we should have the widest possible definition of the animals concerned <e> <s> since the amendment specifies equine animal we have covered all the possibilities <e> <s> we therefore believe that it is a good amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh and speak also to my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment would effectively require the pre-treatment of substances before they are dumped at sea which would thus minimise their damaging effect upon the environment <e> <s> i suggest that the government should give very serious consideration to all the issues raised here as there is little point in trying to clean the beaches if various obnoxious substances are being washed on to them <e>", "<cs> that is one of the most encouraging answers i have received from the dispatch box <e> <s> it is evident that the problem has been recognised and is being dealt with <e> <s> i take it that the fact that such a potentially dangerous chemical could find its way into any type of natural ecosystem has been fully recognised <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say a few words on this matter <e> <s> i spoke at some little length about dyslexic students when these amendments were initially moved and accepted at committee stage <e> <s> i support what the noble lord lord carter said regarding the reason why dyslexic students who are regarded as being disabled when at school and in the workplace they are given green cards are not regarded as being disabled when they are students <e> <s> why is there a three-or four-year period when they stop being disabled <e> <s> some of their <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to raise some matters <e> <s> they may pick up some points already made but i believe that i can still throw a little more light upon the subject from the angle of a student <e> <s> when the issue was first raised i said that i was closer to it because of my age than any other member of your lordships house <e> <s> i do not think that that has changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment because there must be a coherent body to provide a means of enforcing any regulations <e> <s> we should have had an environmental protection agency a long time ago <e> <s> whenever regulations are laid down and objectives are set there must be some way of finding out whether those objectives are being met <e> <s> unless we have a coherent body such as the one suggested in the amendment we shall never have full and coherent enforcement of such regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very briefly to give my support to these amendments <e> <s> i speak in particular to amendments nos <e> <s> and to which i have put my name <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers answer shed a certain amount of light <e> <s> i would rather have a publication that is more readily available than the register so that we can see what is going on <e> <s> when all is said and done that is what the amendments are about <e> <s> we should like to make access as easy as possible <e> <s> however as the government are moving more towards that line of thought i am prepared to withdraw the amendment at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> any new regulation or process should surely have some review built into it <e> <s> the fact that we have previously had problems as regards lack of information in connection with regulations which dealt with pollution control matters under the act indicates that we have got it wrong in the past and are quite capable of doing so again <e>", "<cs> my lords not surprisingly since my name is on it i support the aims of the amendment <e> <s> also we need cross-referencing we constantly find pieces of legislation bumping into each other so surely something of this nature is required <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton would agree with that but does not like the words <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear what the government say in the matter and whether they will provide some other form of guidance about the cross-referencing of regulations in various acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of my noble friend lord ezra <e> <s> the amendments oblige waste collection authorities to pass on savings on disposal costs made to them by waste disposal authorities and also to pass on savings on collection costs which have occurred because of recycling to the individuals and bodies collecting the waste for recycling <e> <s> that effectively means that the direct benefit of any money saved should be passed on to the people along the line who have helped in the recycling process including the recycler <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give the support of these benches to the amendment which stands in the name of my noble friend lord ezra <e> <s> effectively if you are to have a code you must make sure that it is funded otherwise it is totally useless <e> <s> that is the long and short of it <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has done his usual very thorough job in explaining the absurdities of the situation where <e>", "<cs> my lords i give the support of these benches for the amendment <e> <s> as someone who has done a great deal of road running/jogging in urban areas i can say firmly that i am against the souvenirs which our canine friends leave on the pavements although my coach says that it improves my sidestepping when i play rugby <e> <s> once again we must place the responsibility for the control of dogs and everything that goes with them upon the owners <e> <s> dogs are not designed for living in urban areas <e> <s> if man chooses to have a dog in an urban area he must take responsibility for it <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley put the case well <e> <s> i hope that the amendment is accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> it is very sensible <e> <s> it is generous in the amount of time that it gives manufacturers to put the correct type of ring-pull on their cans <e> <s> we should not have to introduce this amendment because the matter should be included in the bill <e> <s> it is simple straightforward and would avoid a great many problems especially for grazing animals <e>", "<cs> my lords in entering the debate i find myself following a great many very good speeches from all sides of the house <e> <s> they started with <e>", "<cs> my lords some small female teachers are indeed very competent <e>"]
