["<cs> my lords it is almost a year to the day since i took my seat in your lordships house and since that day i have been ever aware and increasingly conscious as i have listened to debates of the awe which your lordships house inspires in its new members <e> <s> one cannot but notice the courtesy and forbearing with which it conducts its business and as i rise for the first time tonight to speak it is to that forbearance that i appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord northbourne on his lucid and stimulating maiden speech <e> <s> in several respects he has pre-empted me but i think that perhaps in several respects i was a party to my own downfall because i had the pleasure of helping him in the printed paper office the other night <e> <s> it is a pleasure to welcome the noble lord to our house and i hope that we shall hear from him often <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reassurance and it would be churlish of me to do other than beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in many respects i welcome the bill but i have several reservations about what it will eventually do to both the provision and utilisation of public transport in london and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> while the government are to be applauded for seeking to redefine by legislation a framework within which the metropolitan transport services must be prudently managed and funded the discipline and methods which they are inflicting on the local authorities and transport executives concerned may lead eventually to a less satisfactory provision of service <e> <s> that in turn i fear will lead to less utilisation higher deficits worsening services further declines in usage and finally the need for reconsideration of higher subsidies from central or local funds which the bill seeks to limit <e> <s> whichever party forms the next government i fear that in a couple of years time we will find ourselves back here debating the falling usage and worsening financial position of the undertakings that we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is a unique experience but it is certainly a happy one for me this evening to be able to begin my contribution to a debate on a nationalised industry by having a chance to congratulate two maiden speakers when one of them the noble lord lord ezra was for many years that very nationalised industrys largest customer <e> <s> the other the noble lord lord prys-davies brought to his remarks perhaps a more parochial but nonetheless specialised and appealing point of view <e> <s> i hope that it will be my privilege to be led down those tracks by them again on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an expression in transport called the tidal flow and the tides have certainly been flowing in and out with a vengeance this afternoon <e> <s> at the outset in bringing us back to the london regional transport bill i should like to apologise to the noble lords lord trefgarne and lord lucas and to those of your lordships remaining for not being able to stay until the debate is concluded <e> <s> i must leave early for engagements relating to the liverpool international garden festival which is opening tomorrow <e> <s> at the same time i express my sincere thanks to officials in the department of the environment and the department of transport for their willing and timely help with several facts not apparent from the bill or from its preceding stages in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords having briefly raised the subject of fraudulent travel on second reading i should like to congratulate the government on introducing these five new clauses and thank the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for his lucid exposition of them <e> <s> i should also like to thank everyone who has spoken prior to me on these clauses because everyone has added a little to the collective store of knowledge in what is something of a grey area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i meant to convey that they were becoming increasingly hostile to those who sought to avoid paying the fare <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that the cost of the investment will be met from funds generated internally by british rail <e> <s> if that is so will he reassure the house that it will not be at the expense of investment elsewhere in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to open by thanking the noble lord lord teviot for creating the opportunity this afternoon for us to debate the white paper on buses <e> <s> i found his speech most illuminating <e> <s> i can only hope that it has the same influence on the government as it certainly had on my thinking this afternoon <e> <s> i am a taxpayer a ratepayer and a fare-payer <e> <s> i am a non-motorist <e> <s> i use public transport and at the end of the day howsoever the money gets to the bus companies i pay <e>", "<cs> my lords like others before me i should like to commence by congratulating the select committee not only on the quality of its report but on the pre-emptiveness of its questions and on its many reassuring answers which it obtained from witnesses <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord tordoft has remarked not only have the captains and kings departed but the lights seems to be getting dimmer as well <e> <s> the order before us this evening specifies the governments intentions to see funds earmarked for capital expenditure on roads thus seeking to prevent local authorities from bidding for funds under the heading capital expenditure on roads having their bids granted and then using these funds for revenue account subsidy of what was described by the minister in another place as extravagant public transport subsidies <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord belhaven and stenton for the lucid way in which he has introduced his question this evening <e> <s> i share his interest in the fare-paying passenger and heartily join him in paying tribute to the london regional transport staff <e> <s> i am no less grateful as i am sure many of your lordships will be to the noble lord lord underhill for pre-empting many of my thoughts this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in welcoming this opportunity to debate the eyre report and its recommendations that work should quickly commence on the expansion of stansted and in the medium term on the development of terminal at heathrow <e> <s> we are asked to discuss these recommendations against the background of a quite outstandingly wide-ranging and lucid report and also of the governments policy as the noble lord lord trefgarne reminded us in his opening remarks of meeting demand as and when it arises <e> <s> in the context of his opening remarks we should not overlook the encouragement which the present government have already given to the provincial airports <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful for the opportunity to join in the debate initiated by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> i feel that from my point of view he has put the case for a council for the disabled its genesis its aims and its funding so well that really he can take my support for granted <e> <s> what i should like to do is to add perhaps to the objectives to which i should like to see a national council addressing itself <e> <s> i hope that one of the tasks which it would put high on its list of priorities would be that of educating us the able in how in our day-to-day life we can contribute to the quality of life of the disabled whom we are discussing this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by congratulating the noble lord lord somers on his choice of motion and on his success in the ballot and thanking him for giving us this opportunity to consider the present wellbeing of british railways <e> <s> efficient i believe british railways are and self-rejuvenating if i might vary the noble lords motion a little <e> <s> i feel that the patient as one might call it that we are discussing today having been through a number of traumas since the stedeford report in the early s which was the first signpost along the path which gave us the railways we now have is fully alive and kicking <e> <s> hence i cannot entirely agree with the noble lord lord somers in his choice of the word rejuvenation <e>", "<cs> my lords in his opening remarks the noble lord lord elton told us that this bill came before us in response to a manifesto promise <e> <s> he also told us that when enacted it would stand four square not least in terms of local government being conducted more effectively and less expensively <e> <s> furthermore he told us that it would result in savings <e> <s> it would he added give us local government that is efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking i think about capital cities <e> <s> of the list of cities that the noble viscount has read out only three i believe are capitals <e> <s> the other nine are surely irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords they are in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords i too open my remarks by thanking the noble lord lord shackleton not only for introducing his motion but also for the wide-ranging way in which he did so <e> <s> i have to confess that my own little axe to grind is that i feel almost humble in the context at the same time i feel somewhat enchanted that three of the first four speakers in the debate represent families which have an extensive and long connection with the antarctic <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to comment on the fact that air freight into heathrow is trunked to newcastle for customs clearance and then moved back to london <e> <s> will he examine the customs side of the business and not the air freight side of the business because it seems to me utterly irrational that freight should be trunked miles north for clearance and then miles back <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a slightly more generous welcome than has perhaps been most recently given to the statement which is i think one that will tive a great deal of encouragement to those of us involved in aviation in transport and/or in the tourism industry <e> <s> i agree wholeheartedly with the governments plans as stated today to meet demand as and when it arises both in the south-east and in the regions <e> <s> i wish really to ask only one question <e> <s> can the minister amplify on the remark in the statement that the government will look sympathetically at cases submitted to them for access to airports by rail and road <e> <s> as the minister knows stansted without decent rail access will not be a particularly attractive proposal to the many airlines which will be encouraged to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to say that i agree wholeheartedly with the ends which the government seek to achieve by means of the bill before us tonight <e> <s> usage as the noble lord lord brabazon demonstrated has declined while costs fares and subsidies have increased alarmingly in the bus industry <e> <s> it is only right that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to open my remarks by congratulating our two maiden speakers the noble lord lord sanderson and the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester not only on their speeches but also on the sincerity and the well-informed nature of those speeches <e> <s> it seems to me that too often in this country we find ourselves in a situation where market-place demand of whatever kind cannot be satisfied by the public sector <e> <s> smear tests and the treatment of those consuming illegal drugs and indeed the prevention of such consumption are two rather sad examples <e> <s> the problems posed by coach traffic demand for access to central london are perhaps a more relevant example <e> <s> but all three are cases where demand is outrunning a publicly-provided facility <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i can speak on behalf of the tourist boards <e> <s> i have worked in this dimension <e> <s> we have tried hard to do this <e> <s> as i said in my speech advertisements in <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been done and funnily enough it was done by the noble lords beloved manchester i am sorry lancashire in the first instance not by manchester airport <e>", "<cs> i support lord shepherd in this amendment very largely for the reasons that he has already given us <e> <s> i realise that like others which have come before your lordships committee today it seeks to buy time <e> <s> but this amendment does not seek to buy time because we are unsure of the future it relates not to trial areas nor to conclusions which can be drawn from incomplete experiments <e> <s> rather it seeks to create a breathing space for systems which are already tried and proven and one in particular which is tyne and wear <e> <s> it seeks to create a breathing space for those public transport operations which have invested heavily in integrated systems using rail as their backbone <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble earl lord attlee i shall vote for the continued televising of the proceedings in your lordships house <e> <s> when on the th november last we debated the ground rules <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords on all sides of the house i too begin by congratulating the noble baroness lady hooper on an excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it is always difficult to find words when one makes remarks like that <e> <s> perhaps i may confine myself to saying that i am envious <e> <s> i envy her not only the remarks she made about her former constituency and the little airlines which use speke airport but also her european knowledge and in particular her statement that deep down she believes there is a will for change to change the system which we are discussing today and which underlines the report of the select committee <e> <s> i also congratulate the committee itself for its report and again join many other noble colleagues who have congratulated the noble viscount lord rochdale on this quite marvellous prcis of the report in his opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords declaration of interest is the order of the day so i should like to begin by declaring the very remotest of interests <e> <s> when times are good i lend the national westminster bank money <e> <s> when times are bad it lends me money <e> <s> thus only is my financial interest in todays topic <e> <s> but i have what seems to me a very much greater interest and that is in being able to get to nearer continental europe quickly comfortably and economically <e> <s> hence it follows that i welcome the british and french governments commitment to a fixed link not least because the timescales outlined by the noble earl lord caithness suggest that such a link if it goes ahead will go ahead quickly <e> <s> as has been said we have had two centuries of discussion <e> <s> now perhaps we are doing something that will be a reality not only in my lifetime but in the lifetime of most of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entitled to his beliefs <e> <s> i wish that i could share them <e> <s> the traffic that is currently using the channel does not always consist of vessels built to what used to be called board of trade standards nor even vessels commanded by officers certified by what were known as board of trade standards or officered by men certified by bodies setting other similar standards <e> <s> there are flag of convenience vessels using the channel and i have personally seen the alarm which can arise on the bridge of a sealink ferry and doubtless elsewhere when a ship sailing under a flag of convenience not only ignores the established lane pattern in the channel but also ignores all directions that are given to it by channel traffic control <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur in the universal gratitude expressed to the noble baroness lady stedman for giving us the opportunity to debate this issue <e> <s> i was delighted to be here when the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle in making his maiden speech reminded us of the link between church and railway which as my noble friend lord buckmaster has just said is an ongoing one and one which is not subject to either consultation or closure procedures <e> <s> i too share tonights universal affection for the settle/carlisle line <e> <s> i wish that i could share most of the other sentiments expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can safely say that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has not read my notes but in the concluding minutes of his speech it seemed to me that he must have read my mind because i could not say more than he had just said <e> <s> i agree with him that anyone who takes an interest in british aviation and airports policy will welcome the bill and that one cannot treat the one in isolation from the other <e> <s> they are interrelated <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is standing in my name on the marshalled list <e> <s> i trailed this amendment at our second reading debate <e> <s> i shall not delay your lordships committee with a speech on the massive contribution made to our balance of payments by our tourism airline industry <e> <s> suffice it to say perhaps that the noble lord lord trefgarne opening our debate on the white paper noted that we had not only the worlds favourite airline but also in heathrow and gatwick two of the worlds busiest international airports <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been argued and i think rightly that airports generate employment <e> <s> i cannot however accept the contention that it follows that airports must be built where unemployment is high and in the case of this amendment out in the provinces <e> <s> nor can i accept the contention that a subsidised stansted would leave the directors of the board of a privatised baa in that position for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the minister will not be surprised if i do not entirely come down with all those who so enthusiastically support this amendment <e> <s> i am not persuaded that the thrust of the amendment and indeed the mechanics mentioned by the noble lord lord underhill are relevant <e> <s> i almost feel that they are irrelevant <e> <s> in fact i feel that they are an unnecessary intrusion into the day-to-day operation of our airports and in terms of finance an <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcomed this bill on second reading and tonight i should like to say farewell to it with affection <e> <s> because those who are socially secure may be feeling rather insecure at the moment i shall be brief without the element of health they will be as sick as a parrot <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would he agree that the figures that he has read out reflect the fact that in this country we have too many ports <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister having pre-empted me and before the noble lord lord tordoff decides whether to withdraw his amendment i may ask about subsection of the amendment <e> <s> i am fortunate in that i can always come back on amendment no <e> <s> but subsection reads <e>", "<cs> when back in i think december we debated the issue of the feasibility of a fixed channel link i trailed this amendment so it follows that i am delighted to support it <e> <s> at the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would he not say that that was rather a far-sighted view on the part of british rail given the success of the terminal <e>", "<cs> waterloo is a terminal station <e> <s> how can one have train services beyond waterloo <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wonder whether he could clarify some thoughts for me <e> <s> it is my understanding that an aircraft belonging to a british company can be miles from any source of safety and yet it is also my understanding that there is no statutory requirement under british law or under any other law for that aircraft to be subject to any ban on smoking <e> <s> i wonder whether we really should be looking at this now and whether the noble lord lord ennals is not a little late <e> <s> he should have considered this matter in many other contexts many years ago <e> <s> i understand that on trans-pacific sections one can have people on an aircraft <e> <s> there is no requirement to segregate smokers from non-smokers <e> <s> there is only the lightest of requirements to ban smoking when the commander of an aircraft deems it suitable to do so such as on take-off and landing <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness supports a party which has on numerous occasions over many years tried to bring in laws not on the basis of seeking to change what is established but seeking to influence what is to come <e> <s> i was a little amused by her reference to alcohol because this amendment relates to tobacco <e> <s> if you wish to ban smoking outright then <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister before he replies could confirm that british rail does a great deal of planning <e> <s> in recent years it has become apparent that when british rail puts a plan to the secretary of state and the government approve it it tends to get on with it quicker than the plan allows <e> <s> i am thinking of the east coast electrification of the electrification to peterborough and of the hastings line electrification <e> <s> all those projects came in ahead of schedule in terms of the time originally allowed in the plan <e> <s> would it therefore not be prudent to let british rail present its plan at the latest possible moment in the hope that in the light of its recent <e>", "<cs> we trailed this amendment profusely when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> a last thursday night <e> <s> it was also discussed to a certain extent just now in connection with the amendments moved by the noble baroness lady lockwood <e> <s> it seems to me that what it is really about and i should like to ignore emotional expressions from the noble lord lord carmichael such as the community being torn to pieces by this new development is whether the choice of waterloo was right and whether we should stand by it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little concerned about the amendment because the word independent seems to kill it stone dead <e> <s> surely no person of sufficient stature to be as the amendment puts it the head of the uk delegation could reach the stature required to become that head without a considerable degree of dependence upon the government <e> <s> if i am correct i believe that major rose would be the designated head of the uk delegation <e> <s> as far as i recall the previous experience of major rose has been entirely in the armed services or in the railways inspectorate which is an element of the department of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to advance a slightly different point of view in relation to this amendment <e> <s> first it seems to me that to a certain extent the on-train amendment put forward by the minister this afternoon weakened the agruments made in committee in favour of this kind of amendment <e> <s> they made british rails ability to spread traffic out of waterloo much greater <e> <s> i did not do so at the time but i should now like to join the chorus of approval for the on-train control amendment <e> <s> secondly if lambeth council is not particularly inclined to consult now what reason do we have to believe that it will be inclined to do so at a future date <e> <s> indeed what reason have we for enshrining in statute its right to consult <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot accept that argument <e> <s> the council has so far been so negative that it seems to me there is no valid reason to give it a statutory ability to consult in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall shorten the observations i intended to make and very simply echo the nice sentiments that have been expressed concerning the minister the select committee and its chairman <e> <s> i should also like to offer my thanks and i am sure the thanks of many of my colleagues in this house who have taken part in the debates on this bill to both the ministers officials and to those whom i might call our own advisers on this side of the house <e> <s> whenever we had a point and quite often it was a <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing his motion which i also sincerely welcome the noble lord lord underhill reminded us that over per cent <e> <s> of households in this country do not have access to cars <e> <s> i belong to one of those households willingly i should say and not by reason of a decision of the justices and i like my public transport to be practical <e> <s> i like it to be economical in that i pay for the usage when i pay my fare although i also pay for the facility through my rates and my taxes and i want it to be attractive <e> <s> i also want it to be accessible <e>", "<cs> my lords we are only half way through the list <e> <s> i therefore should like to concentrate on one element of the bill clause rather than get involved in a long general discussion of the bills merits <e> <s> while doing so i must put on record that i am inclined towards those who have addressed themselves to the banded option <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i have listened to much of the debate this evening and i think the noble lord has answered almost all the questions put to him but he has not answered mine <e> <s> may i ask him possibly to shuffle through his papers or perhaps say that he will write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy with a written answer <e>", "<cs> one of the joys of speaking fourth in a little debate like this is that most points have been made before <e> <s> so one puts away ones first page or almost <e> <s> but i would agree with those members of the committee who have said that direct billing in lieu of precept is harmful to public transport in the metropolitan areas at this time rather than being a progressive move <e> <s> as has been said it will have a negative effect on the provision of service in general apart from the concessionary schemes <e> <s> it will prevent forward planning without which no sensible public transport organisation indeed no private enterprise can operate <e> <s> if a private enterprise or a public one does not know whence its funds are coming it cannot plan ahead <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but did the noble lord not just quote the association of metropolitan authorities whereas the question is being asked about the ptas and the districts <e> <s> although they are all in one chain i do not think one can say that if one puts the umbrella up the left foot necessarily agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest and i should like also to echo the words of those who have already thanked the noble lord lord ponsonby for giving us an opportunity this evening to debate tourism and the current review <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord montagu for the generous tribute which he has just paid to my colleagues <e> <s> it may interest your lordships to know that my very first job in the tourist industry was polishing his car when his by now marvellous museum was but a pair of nissen huts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i speak for all of us when i thank the noble lord lord teviot for giving us an opportunity this evening to debate the present situation regarding regional airports and the intercontinental airlines <e> <s> i do not think that anybody who makes a habit of attending <e>", "<cs> my lords i picked up that remark by the noble lord <e> <s> i think that he referred to people who live within two hours of manchester airport <e> <s> i said that we must be very careful because two hours from manchester airport brings one very close to the south-east <e> <s> in seeking to build up manchester airport one must therefore be very careful that one does not do so to the detriment of birmingham which he mentioned earlier in his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords ours is a caring house as i believe has been shown this afternoon by the many sentiments that have been expressed in the context of this mornings disaster at clapham <e> <s> it is also an expert house as has been shown by all the contributions to the debate this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may echo the last few words of the noble earl lord liverpool who i believe said that this is not a perfect bill and that we hope to improve it as it goes through <e> <s> i believe that to be absolutely right <e> <s> it is not a perfect bill <e> <s> those of us who are taxpayers and ratepayers pay each weekend towards the cost of funding the activities of football fans outside the stadium <e> <s> the football teams pay for their policing inside the grounds and that i totally appreciate <e> <s> we pay for it outside <e> <s> that if nothing else is an excellent reason for the government to bring forward this bill tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i greatly admired his speech because it addressed itself to the issues whereas the speech made by the noble lord lord harris was if i may say so trivial <e> <s> i have sympathy with the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and i welcome his support for what i am saying <e> <s> i do not feel that we should be paying for the by-products of football hooliganism <e> <s> as a hampshire ratepayer and taxpayer i resent having to pay twice over the costs incurred in policing supporters outside the grounds every time that southampton portsmouth and bournemouth play at home <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister rises again perhaps i may ask the noble lord why we are told this only now <e> <s> it is delightful to hear about the ama not many league clubs are within the ambit of the ama and the football family forum which i had not heard of before <e> <s> but why are we told this now <e> <s> surely it would have been more helpful to have been told of it before now <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord somers for giving us the opportunity today to debate the use we are making of our railways <e> <s> i feel that the number of speakers the noble lord lord ezra touched on this point who are participating today and the fact that there are some seven or eight rail-related bills at various stages in your lordships house and another six presently before another place suggest that the environmental and economic benefits of railways are once again coming into their own and that the railways in general are moving gently towards another period of greatness <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed whether stansted airport should be developed i argued that it should but there would have to be decent rail access <e> <s> i suspect that in a years time i shall be arguing in favour of decent rail access by the tyne-wear metro from the city of newcastle to woolsington airport <e> <s> it will come as no surprise to noble lords that i believe both the bill and the heathrow express concept are very attractive indeed <e> <s> i could argue about the success of the gatwick express but i do not believe that that point needs to be aired further <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been involved since second reading in the foreign tourism aspect of this bill <e> <s> i welcome amendment no <e> <s> because it gives the industry an opportunity <e> <s> i welcome amendment no <e> <s> for a different reason i think that it may attract back some of those people who have been lost to football <e> <s> it is at the very core of the bill <e> <s> it would make football more acceptable and this group of people would return <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this amendment has suffered somewhat in the printing because when i first read it it referred to the word passports and now it refers to passport <e> <s> i am unaware of any such thing as an international football match passport although the way passports are stamped nowadays perhaps football teams should stamp them instead of the country whose frontiers are being crossed <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome this bill and the proposals so ably introduced by the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu <e> <s> i wish to approach the subject from a slightly different tack initially and perhaps in not such a parochial way <e> <s> i draw your lordships attention to a speech made by john banham the director general of the cbi at the chartered institute of transport last monday <e> <s> he said that in national terms we are developing a huge problem of congestion <e> <s> he said that congestion costs money and at the end of the day costs are not passed on to the noble lord lord lucas businessman friend they are passed on to the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord lucas had listened to what i said he would have heard me say that the costs would not end with him and his business i withdraw the word friend but with his business advisers and contacts <e> <s> at the end of the day the costs are borne by the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the proceedings there is not much to say all that one can do is to try to say it in another way <e> <s> i should like to pay a general tribute to the government <e> <s> they have said that they will listen to us <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness has been sitting in the house for six hours listening to us speak and deny <e> <s> the fact that he is present appeals to me enormously <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord teviot for so ably introducing this bill and for making clear to me one or two points which are not readily apparent <e> <s> although it is a modest measure it is not the most modest of bills <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the honourable member for leeds north-east on getting the bill to this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl lord russell for raising this topic albeit only as a trailer for the much wider debate that we shall be having in three weeks time <e> <s> i notice that we have a transport debate a transport issue or a transport topic every wednesday both today next wednesday the wednesday after and the noble lord lord underbills debate is the icing on the cake towards the end of the month <e> <s> by that time i believe that we shall all need a recess because we shall have become as tired of transport as of water and electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl lord kinnoull for raising this issue today <e> <s> i found especially interesting his remarks about what one might call good will or intangibles those that lie outside the fair market value of the property in normal circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords one must begin by congratulating the noble lord lord bancroft on his speech this afternoon and also the noble lord and his colleagues and the officials who supported them on what is an excellent and fascinating report <e>", "<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships this afternoon i must begin by apologising publicly as i have already done in private to the noble lord lord underhill to whom i am grateful for giving us the opportunity to enjoy this debate on transport today <e> <s> i must also apologise to the minister and to your lordships house because i find myself in something of a cleft stick today <e> <s> on the one hand we have this quite enchanting debate and on the other hand there is the opportunity for me to go to an rsa lecture <e> <s> in fact i accepted that opportunity a long time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl lord caithness told us in his opening remarks this is a bill which <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because my voice is a little less reliable than i would like it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may bring the debate down to a lower level because i propose to defend duty free <e> <s> to defend duty free in the context of the single market is potentially to defend the indefensible <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be very difficult to follow the last two sentences of the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> he has put everything that many of us intended to say today in an absolute and concise nutshell <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that time is pressing but perhaps i may start with two <e>", "<cs> we should seek other means and there are other means to cope with the problems we face <e> <s> one which is very close to hand is flexi-time <e> <s> this is practised in much of enlightened industry in britain <e> <s> it is practised by government departments <e> <s> in fact i am indebted to officials for reminding me that the department of transport practises flexi-time <e> <s> however members of staff must be at work by oclock and to satisfy that requirement must travel in the peak <e> <s> so they miss the economic fares available after <e> <s> perhaps we need a culture change to alter our working habits <e>", "<cs> i walked today from regents park to the south bank and from the south bank to parliament <e> <s> between and oclock this morning the traffic between regents park and south bank was moving pretty well <e> <s> i walked along the road between waterloo and here across the bridge and the traffic was moving pretty well <e> <s> that is an instant <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble earl lord winchilsea and nottingham as i believe all speakers have in urging the promoters of the bill to withdraw clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> of course we have dental hygienists and others but they are not allowed to practise nationwide as dentists <e>", "<cs> my lords for good or ill we find ourselves under the most intensively used piece <e>", "<cs> my lords the final point of the noble lord lord teviot appealed to me very much <e> <s> like all noble lords who have spoken i am grateful to my colleague the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for raising this issue <e> <s> the subject seems to fall into two sections infrastructure and awareness <e> <s> at the end of my remarks i shall come back to the subject of awareness because i believe that that is where we can help the disabled without spending a vast amount of money on infrastructure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i should like to point out that british rail did address itself to the problem <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will go on to say that the disabled toilet which is currently being installed in trains is one which has actually won prizes for its user-friendliness <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with all back bench speakers i should like to support my noble friend lord marshall of leeds in asking that the bill be given a second reading <e> <s> in doing so i declare an interest <e>", "<cs> my lords one way or another i can support every noble lord who has so far spoken <e> <s> it is interesting to note that when the transport specialists get together their speeches interrelate much more than in the adversarial <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill referred to small airports <e> <s> i was a little surprised when he admitted that he regarded all airports outside heathrow and gatwick as small airports <e> <s> i should have thought that manchester and newcastle were fairly large airports as are many others <e> <s> i am intrigued that the noble lord has picked up the point that i made about small airports on second reading <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff also picked up that point when he repeated an argument i had previously made that security is as weak as its weakest link <e> <s> however the figure of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i open my remarks by declaring an interest <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord underhill on giving us the opportunity today for a very topical debate <e> <s> it is particularly welcome that it has attracted a number of speakers who do not normally participate in our transport deliberations <e> <s> as many other speakers have mentioned we have also enjoyed a breath of fresh air in a maiden speech which has introduced a new dimension and is to be greatly welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare what i now hope is my widely known interest on behalf of british rail <e> <s> in the context of this bill i have also consulted my friends in tyne and wear <e> <s> noble lords will know that i am a national judge of the best kept station contest run by british rail and tidy britain <e> <s> i am therefore aware of the litter problem which british rail sometimes creates of its own accord but which frequently as i shall show has thrust upon it <e> <s> i am interested in particular in the proposals contained in part iv of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look at that further <e> <s> if the public do not have access there is a matter called trespass <e> <s> my reading of the bill was that the abatement orders could be applied to any british rail land even land cleared by the property board but not developed over a period of five or six years <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend who has officials there will in the short term act as a referee as regards the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation which i shall read with great interest <e> <s> one proposal to which i did not understand my noble friends answer was the reversal of the theory of the polluter pays which i put forward <e> <s> here it will be the taxpayer and the british rail customer who will pay for the clearing up <e> <s> perhaps i may think a little more about that <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we were told in the gracious speech that her majestys government would promote improved efficiency and safety in public transport <e> <s> we were also given a legislative programme <e> <s> since that speech there has been the autumn statement <e> <s> that gives those of us who are speaking in this debate a great advantage because it announced record levels of investment in road and rail <e> <s> in addition we have heard my noble friends speech this afternoon amplifying her majestys governments plans <e> <s> it will come as no surprise to noble lords who have heard me declare my interest over the years if i concentrate on the public transport elements of todays debate <e>"]
