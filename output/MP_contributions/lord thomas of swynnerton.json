surprised my noble friend the minister did not begin his speech by intoning as lord curzon did in at the end of the first world war the first strophe of shelleys ode to hellas <e>", "<cs> my lords i

<e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord jenkins of hillhead for introducing the debate <e> <s> the terms of the motion are of particular interest since they in a sense go
