["<cs> my lords as this is the first opportunity that i have had to do so in this chamber i should like to begin by offering my congratulations to the noble lord lord belstead on his appointment as parliamentary under-secretary of state at the home office <e> <s> i have no doubt at all that he will enjoy his time there <e> <s> i certainly enjoyed my time there enormously <e> <s> i hope that i shall be forgiven if i venture the view that i was not there long enough to do that department lasting damage <e> <s> it is a splendid department and i would pay tribute to the excellent officials there and the splendid service with which they provided me <e> <s> i wish the noble lord well and trust that he will have a happy rewarding and productive period there <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby has performed a most valuable service this evening in raising this question <e> <s> he has an extensive knowledge of animal welfare matters and a distinguished record on these matters both inside your lordships house and in the role that he fulfils outside <e> <s> he has again shown his persistence and determination tonight in seeking reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that as we found in a recent debate in your lordships house there are real difficulties about giving reasons and while i should also like to welcome what the minister has said about publishing an assessment can the noble lord go any further this afternoon and say whether or not that assessment will <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to commend my noble friend lord longford most warmly for giving us the chance to debate this topic and for moving the second reading of his criminal injuries compensation bill <e> <s> by doing so he has underlined the importance of not forgetting the victims of crime and especially those who suffer personal injury at the hands of the criminal <e> <s> my noble friend has long been widely known as a fighter for the rights of prisoners for penal reform and for safeguards for the accused <e> <s> what is perhaps not widely known particularly outside your lordships house is that for quite some time he has also been working behind the scenes supporting the cause of victims of crime <e>", "<cs> my lords as has happened on previous occasions my noble friend has with his customary expertise anticipated passages in my speech <e> <s> also this afternoon we may be privileged to hear if he will forgive the expression from the horses <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord teviot is to be congratulated on having lost no time in introducing his bill into this parliament <e> <s> his previous bill which received a second reading in your lordships house on rd november last year was a victim of the dissolution and now remains a matter of what might indeed be called in the current context historical public record <e> <s> but now the noble lords speedy action has brought the bill forward again <e> <s> i was not able to be present on the last occasion but i have read that debate and it is clear that just as it did then the house has again benefited from the noble lords knowledge and expertise in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady phillips could hardly have chosen a better moment to raise this subject <e> <s> not only should i like to thank her for initiating this debate but i should also like to congratulate her on her timing <e> <s> she has taken a keen interest in this whole subject for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord inglewood for enabling us to discuss this subject tonight <e> <s> he takes a close interest in police matters and has done so over a considerable period not only in this country but also abroad <e>", "<cs> i think not my lords but in case i did not put it clearly enough what i was referring to during that period from to when the willinck report came out as the noble lord lord mottistone correctly said was that as the report indicated there had not been any appointment of any chief inspectors of constabulary for england or for wales or for scotland but i think that is part of the point that the noble lord was making <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that the work of the commission is regarded as very important indeed not only here at home but abroad as well and that some of your lordships who have represented this country abroad i am thinking particularly of the united nations have found it of immense value to be able to refer to the work of this commission especially when dealing with human <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is part of the historic sequence of measures which stem from the decision that this country should join the european economic communities and take part in direct elections <e> <s> it cannot be described as a momentous measure in itself no doubt and it will probably be greeted with something less than unabated rapture by those of my noble friends and other noble lords who have been consistently unenthusiastic about the decision to join europe itself <e> <s> but it is a necessary step one which flows naturally from the decisions mentioned <e> <s> therefore on behalf of the opposition i would support the bill <e> <s> in doing so i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord belstead for his clear and very helpful introduction to it <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i was looking forward to hearing the noble lord lord belstead and my wish to hear him was coming even more rapidly than i had dared to hope <e> <s> i should like to join with my noble friend lord wigg and the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls in thanking the noble lord lord birkett for introducing this bill and in congratulating him for doing so <e> <s> i should like to thank him not only for introducing the bill but for explaining the effect of the bill and the need for the bill with great clarity <e> <s> he has in my submission shown a need for this modest measure and it is good to hear the explanation that he has given <e> <s> i feel sure that my noble friend lord wigg and the right reverend prelate will forgive me for not venturing further into the interesting and important matters on a rather wider level that they have raised this afternoon <e> <s> my noble friend lord wigg does of course speak with great experience of these matters not only as the former chairman of the horserace betting levy board but in connection with other bodies as well <e> <s> my purpose in intervening is to detain your lordships for only so long as it takes to join in commending this bill to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the statement he has made <e> <s> i would also say that my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones is particularly sorry not to be able to hear the statement of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he is attending in an official capacity the celebrations in strasbourg marking the th anniversary of the foundation of the council of europe and the th anniversary of the european court of human rights <e> <s> while he is sorry not to be here he is of course delighted to be there <e> <s> i hope that that is a balanced legal observation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend lord janner in thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for introducing these regulations <e> <s> i do so also on behalf of my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones who is sorry that he is unable to be here for the introduction of these regulations for the reasons which your lordships have already heard <e> <s> i would only add that it is of course vitally important that the financial limits mentioned by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor are revised so as to keep pace with inflation and are kept in line with increases in supplementary benefits <e> <s> therefore from this bench i offer a welcome to the proposed regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the motion is put by the noble and learned lord and before we part from this matter this afternoon perhaps i might add a word or two to what my noble friend lord longford has said <e> <s> in view of the points which my noble friend has made this afternoon i feel sure that your lordships will consider that he has taken the appropriate course today but i should not want this moment to pass without a word of tribute to him <e> <s> there is no doubt that he has performed a most valuable service in introducing this bill and in having it debated <e> <s> it has helped to draw attention to this important matter and it has given impetus to the improvements which are being made and to the consideration of further reforms <e> <s> therefore my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only very briefly tonight <e> <s> i do not wish to seek to use this occasion for any definitive statement from this bench on future action on drugs <e> <s> i intervene principally to express my warm thanks to the noble earl lord denbigh for having posed this unstarred question this afternoon <e> <s> he speaks with great experience as chairman of the standing conference on drug abuses and he has a very wide knowledge of these matters <e> <s> as he said this is increasingly a problem and a matter which is of widespread and growing concern throughout the country <e> <s> indeed to any of us whether it be in the courts or in other ways who have seen those who have been affected by it it is a deeply distressing one too as for example the noble baroness lady macleod mentioned tonight particularly in her references to young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord belstead for repeating this important statement this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that the government are to be congratulated on their consistency in rejecting the proposal for doubling summer time <e> <s> after all would it not be a little inconsistent to increase summer time while the government go around cutting everything else <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a wide range of views expressed tonight on this matter the protection of official information bill <e> <s> i suppose the one thing on which there <e>", "<cs> my lords one matter upon which i think we all agree tonight is that the noble lord lord wade is to be congratulated on his determination <e> <s> i am sure that we all admire the way in which he has urged the house consistently and repeatedly to adopt a measure of the kind now again proposed and he does so as he did in the select committee in such an engaging way <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be very grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for introducing the regulations and explaining them so clearly <e> <s> i must apologise to him for having missed the first part of his opening remarks <e> <s> i was called out of the chamber to take an urgent telephone call and i am afraid that i did not return in time <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister has explained the regulations that he has introduced for scotland are similar to those which were introduced on i think th october this year by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and we had then from this bench an opportunity to welcome the introduction of those two sets of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for having explained the purpose of this bill to your lordships <e> <s> it is not often that we have the chance to discuss the isle of man in your lordships house and even though this particular measure does not really provide an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate it is a particular pleasure and the noble lord alluded to this in his speech that this rather rare opportunity to consider the islands affairs comes this year when tynwald is celebrating its millennium <e> <s> i am sure that we all join again in offering our warm congratulations on this historic event <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord newall has performed a service to the house in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for his intervention because it gives me an opportunity should the point that i was making not have been made sufficiently clearly to point out that i was in fact by no means accepting the interpretation that in my view the royal commission has appeared to place upon those two sports and to draw that distinction between the two <e> <s> it is not of course for me to judge the extent to which that is or is not justified but that somewhat gratuitous sideswipe at greyhound racing as some people have regarded it understandably appears to have caused considerable resentment among supporters and understandably so <e> <s> some of those supporters seem to feel it was a pity that the commission took that unnecessary line especially as many of its recommendations there were not many <e>", "<cs> my lords if what my noble friend with his experience says is right then that may well come as some considerable reassurance to some people but it was certainly my impression that it was not only the press which had been led to take that view to put that interpretation on what was said it was indeed some people associated quite closely with the sport itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain your lordships for only a minute or two but lest it should be thought that silence from this particular dispatch box indicates a lack of interest in this important subject on this bench i intervene first to reassure your lordships and to confirm that we do indeed regard this whole matter of the protection and the advancement of human rights as of immense importance <e> <s> secondly i recall that we have especially my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones argued on previous occasions that we are not able to support this bill of the noble lord lord wade and incorporation of the european convention on human rights into our law because we have taken the view and i am afraid still do that we do not regard this as the best nor even a satisfactory way of advancing the cause of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord belstead for explaining these regulations <e> <s> the argument that on grounds of security the letter s should be removed from the names of service voters on the electoral register is very strong <e> <s> in some ways i suppose some people might feel it rather a pity to lose that indication and the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly to say a word or two on behalf of my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey <e> <s> i must confess that i cannot claim any expertise in scottish law <e> <s> i do not say that this is a virtue but it enables me to respond all the more easily to the very appropriate appeal for brevity which was made a few minutes ago by the noble lord lord denham <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord trefgarne began his speech on this order and used if i heard him correctly the words the bill i thought for a moment that at last after a splendid revelation on his part he was going to make the concession which has been so vigorously sought on this side of this house and in another place as well <e> <s> but my lords as we have heard that is alas <e> <s> not so <e> <s> i do not propose to detain the house long on this particular order <e> <s> as we have heard from the noble lord lord trefgarne and the house will be grateful to him for his explanation of the order it gives extensive powers to the governor <e>", "<cs> my lords the debates which your lordships have had on this bill have indeed been very valuable <e> <s> on a previous occasion my noble friend lord wells-pestell had the opportunity from these benches to express views about it <e> <s> i have nothing further to add to that and would only join the noble lord lord sandys in congratulating the noble earl lord kinnoull on his conduct of the bill through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord belstead has indicated we all owe a great debt to the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies and his committee of inquiry on the police for the immense amount of work they have put into their task a very demanding one indeed not only on this particular aspect of their inquiry but also on the others as well <e> <s> their first report on the negotiating machinery led directly to the bill we are debating today <e> <s> the house will also be grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for his admirably clear and concise explanation <e> <s> i fear that i shall not be able to be quite so concise but i shall be as rapid as possible <e>", "<cs> we on these benches as the committee will recall have already had an opportunity to welcome this bill and we are grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for having explained these two amendments to the committee <e> <s> they are in the nature of a tidying-up operation and we certainly would not wish to stand in the way of any tidying-up operation of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am not able to support the noble lord lord inglewood in moving these amendments he has performed a service not only today but on two occasions last week in raising points concerning special constables who indeed perform a very valuable service and who form a most useful part of the police service as a whole <e> <s> one certainly hopes that we can look forward to an increase in their numbers in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench would like to join the noble lord lord sandys in congratulating the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran on introducing this bill on conducting it through your lordships house and on commending it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for the indication the minister has given about the study <e> <s> will he accept that while it would be quite wrong to be alarmist common prudence dictates that the events of the last few weeks suggest that this is a matter which should be treated with rather greater urgency than perhaps any of us has treated it before <e> <s> can he say when his examination of the study to which he referred today and to which he also referred on th december when we last considered this matter will be completed and whether when that is complete the government will be publishing their views <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have already welcomed this bill <e> <s> indeed action along these lines was contemplated before the change of government took place last year <e> <s> there is something which i should like to say at this stage <e> <s> in your lordships second reading debate i referred to the proposal for an independent secretariat and welcomed warmly the recommendation by the edmund-davies committee that it should be set up <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the fact that some consultation process is envisaged by the noble lord lord belstead in the answer that he has just given suggest that some machinery is in fact needed to carry out that consultation process <e> <s> would he say to the house that if in the course of these consultations which the government envisage having it emerges as my noble friend lord underhill has suggested that <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill if it becomes an act will represent a significant advance in family law <e> <s> i believe that it is a particularly happy and appropriate fact that this reform would come under the heading of family law and i emphasise the word family <e> <s> the term family law is not always altogether apt when one considers some matters that it covers though i would not want to seek to change it <e> <s> so often it is necessarily more concerned with the break up of the family than with its promotion even though the aim there is partly too to protect the family from for instance the effects of divorce <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating this statement and your lordships will be glad to have it at this time <e> <s> the statement itself does not indicate any change in the law <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would agree as seems to be quite clear from the statement itself that it is a statement of what the law actually is and if i may say so with respect a clear one <e>", "<cs> my lords this order like the similar one that i happen to have moved from the position of the noble lord lord belstead last year and the act upon which it is based are distasteful and indeed obnoxious measures <e> <s> they are objectionable because they infringe our civil liberties but they are also repugnant because of the acts of those who have compelled us to resort to legislation of this kind cowardly acts of terrorism in which innocent people have been brutally and callously murdered or maimed fami <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly no doubt in my mind that my noble friend lord longford should be acquitted of any charge of lack of interest in the victims of crime indeed if i may say so there should be no question of even charging him with such an offence in the first place let alone of his having to be put on trial and acquitted of it because it was only on rd july that we had the second reading of the criminal injuries compensation bill which my noble friend introduced and that was far from being the first occasion on which he had shown his concern for the victims of crime especially those who have suffered personal injury at the hands of the criminal <e> <s> of course he has established himself too over many years as a campaigner for penal reform and for the rights of prisoners <e> <s> i believe also that he has chosen the right moment to raise this subject and i would like to thank him for doing so because i believe we are fast approaching the moment when some decisions will be necessary on our policies for dealing with life sentences and prisoners serving them <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go along with my noble friend on the last point he made but certainly what he said at the beginning of his remarks i would not dissent from <e> <s> we are assured that prisoners are informed of the procedure <e> <s> i wonder however and the noble lord lord belstead when he replies might wish to comment on this how fully the procedure is explained to them and when that is done how fully they are kept informed and whether more should in fact be done in this direction <e> <s> i wonder too whether there is scope for speeding up the reviewing procedure itself once it is under way <e> <s> i am not necessarily suggesting that we should shorten the time before prisoners cases come up for review <e> <s> rather i am wondering whether there is any scope for speeding up the process itself perhaps considering the sort of steps which the noble lord lord hunt suggested last year in relation to the parole system itself <e> <s> there is also the question of the appearance before the local review committee of the prisoner himself to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord belstead for repeating this statement and for taking this early opportunity to report to <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another matter that i would venture to put to the noble lord <e> <s> in doing so i should like to thank him for the forthcoming way that he dealt with the questions so far raised <e> <s> can he say anything at this early stage about the question of compensation for the victims of the events of yesterday <e> <s> obviously we all deeply deplore the violence that occurred and which resulted not only in the injuries about which he has told us but also in the great damage which appears to have been done <e> <s> i am sure that at an early stage at any rate it would be helpful if anything can be done to indicate to people what the position is there <e> <s> may i add that we all very much share in what he has said about the courage of the police and most notably of the chief constable of avon and somerset who i think has been fairly recently appointed and who if the reports are correct was right in the thick of things from as early an opportunity as was possible throughout yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for informing your lordships about the situation at the iranian embassy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a warm welcome to this bill and to thank the noble lord lord avebury for introducing it <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that it is needed and i believe that the need for it can be seen even more clearly as a result of recent events as i shall mention in a moment <e> <s> as the noble lord has explained the bill is almost the same as the bill of the same name which was introduced by the last government except for the powers relating to devolution which were in the last bill but which are not in this one <e> <s> in all other respects the terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement and for continuing to keep the house informed <e> <s> we fully understand the governments position in this matter and that they are in touch with the situation on a minute-to-minute basis <e> <s> may i take this opportunity to commend the patience and courage shown by the police and the other services in the way they deal with situations of this kind <e> <s> clearly we all join in hoping that this incident will end speedily and without bloodshed and further injury <e> <s> i do not feel that it would be appropriate either to put any questions to the noble lord lord belstead or indeed to say anything more <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this important statement <e> <s> we on these benches and i am sure that this goes for noble lords in all parts of your lordships house would like to offer to the government our warm congratulations on what was undoubtedly a brilliantly successful operation <e> <s> i would hope that a way will he found to pass on our congratulations to the police to the special air services regiment and to the other services involved and especially to the commissioner sir david mcnee and to the deputy assistant commissioner mr john dellow who was assigned to this particular post only last year and perhaps your lordships might agree not least to police constable trevor locke <e> <s> throughout the operation the patience courage and swift efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lady phillips on having mastered what is an intricate branch of our law in a way which i think will be the envy of lawyers <e> <s> i am also sure that we admire the care which has been taken by all those concerned to consult all the interested parties <e> <s> i think it is significant too that such a broad measure of agreement in a sphere which is notorious for controversy has been reached <e> <s> this in itself and here i would also follow my noble friend is perhaps a refreshing aspect of this matter <e> <s> my noble friend might have referred in her historical survey to a reduction in the consumption of spirits but certainly in the way that she has presented this bill to the house i think she has if i may say so certainly raised our spirits <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord inglewood for having reintroduced this bill and for having done so in his customarily clear and concise way <e> <s> i would also agree with what noble lords have said about the need to take every possible step that we can to curb violence both in public houses and elsewhere and indeed to protect publicans and others <e>", "<cs> my lords there are few cases which are more deserving of help than the case of mr berry and mrs ward <e> <s> indeed there are few which are as deserving as theirs when one is considering whether a step parent and a stepchild should be allowed to marry <e> <s> i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the way in which he has moved the second reading of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister the noble lord lord bellwin has said this bill fulfils a commitment which was entered into by the last government to provide funds so that the port of london authority can give severance pay to those who lose their jobs and to carry on its operations during the period in which the port becomes profitable <e> <s> so far as the provision of money under this bill is concerned i believe that the only change compared with the amount envisaged by the last government is that it has been increased to take inflation into account <e> <s> therefore i would welcome the provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the minister the noble lord lord belstead in supporting this order and i should like to thank him for explaining it to your lordships so clearly <e> <s> i agree with the points that he has made about the need for this order and indeed i think that it would be a little inconsistent of me to do otherwise because it is the case that my noble friend lord wells-pestell had occasion to move similar orders from the despatch box of the noble lord the minister while the last government were in office <e>", "<cs> my lords i reassure the noble lord lord renton that so far as i was concerned and i suspect so far as the noble lord lord winstanley was concerned we were thinking of future possible legislative occasions and not in connection with this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would not like to let this occasion pass withtou congratulating my noble friend on having brewed up a really splendid bill and for having put it forward in such a spirited way <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord belstead for explaining this proposed order to the house and also for the assurances he has given about the views of members of both houses of parliament <e> <s> although on the face of it the subject matter of this order looks innocuous enough it is just the type of measure that is capable of arousing deep feelings and of sparking off fierce controversy <e> <s> no doubt there will be those who will see this draft order as a further example certainly so far as the starting dates are concerned of the efforts of those in the european economic community who seek to regulate our lives in as they would put it an even more rigid and uniform way and who therefore will regard it as most unwelcome <e> <s> but undoubtedly there will also be those who will claim that the provision is bound to be beneficial and will help tourists and travellers of all kinds and be helpful to industry commerce and others <e> <s> i do not find it easy to work up an immense amount of enthusiasm one way or the other but i would not invite my noble friends to oppose this measure <e> <s> i would certainly endorse what the noble lord lord belstead has said about the popularity of the principle of summer time in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> it is a lengthy one on a very complicated subject and therefore i am sure that your lordships will appreciate that detailed comment will need to await both further study of the statement and of the white paper itself <e> <s> i would say at this stage that i welcome in principle the proposal to bring in a new british nationality act <e> <s> it is clearly needed <e> <s> indeed it is something we had intended to do as foreshadowed in the green paper <e> <s> i would ask the minister first whether the government intend to seek to discuss this with the other commonwealth countries whether discussions have already taken place and whether any indications have come from commonwealth countries of their views because as he has indicated in the statement there is a proposal for commonwealth citizenship and there is therefore i assume a need to seek reciprocity about that <e> <s> i would ask also whether there are any implications for our citizenship law in the law of the eec to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord belstead for repeating this statement and i certainly welcome the review which has been carried out <e> <s> it was right to carry out a thorough review <e> <s> the statement raises a large number of matters which perhaps we could return to on another occasion so as to go into them in rather more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is clearly desirable that there should be as much free movement of people as possible does the minister appreciate that many people will have been disturbed by the lifting of this ban <e> <s> will he say whether the government have considered the evidence adduced in the course of the inquiries in australia and indeed during the course of the libel action brought by the church of scientology against the honourable member mr geoffrey johnson smith in which my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones led so successfully for the defence <e> <s> the jurys decision clearly supported the conclusion of the then minister of health that scientology was socially harmful and that its methods could be a serious danger to the health of those who submitted to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is a sombre statement and a very serious one indeed <e> <s> i would say first that it is absolutely right for the government to give priority to safety and to preserving and protecting the criminal justice system and indeed to give priority to the care for inmates <e> <s> but it is of vital importance first of all to regard public safety as of paramount importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord sandys for his explanation of this order and i am sure that all noble lords will be very grateful to him for that <e> <s> it is interesting to note that as the noble lord has indicated it is quite an early charity dating from <e> <s> it therefore dates from before the great statute of elizabeth i the charitable uses act and it was not affected by that act <e> <s> this charity must have been very well drawn originally and its purposes were clearly not among those abuses aimed at by that statute of elizabeth i so that one can only congratulate those originally associated with it <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task is a very pleasant one indeed <e> <s> it is to congratulate the noble lord lord wade on the tenacity and persistence he has shown in moving the second reading of the bill for it is the fourth occasion on which he has moved a bill along these lines and i congratulate him too on the way in which he introduced it today <e> <s> in fact until i heard his speech i thought there was very little new to say on the subject so frequently have we debated it in your lordships house but the noble lord has put his arguments in a refreshingly new way so there is no call whatever for any forgiveness of him <e> <s> all the same i have been feeling for some time that as a number of us have been debating these matters over quite a period now it really is time the noble lord formed us into a bill of rights club but i would hope that membership would be open not only to those of us who are supporters of his bill but also to those of us who are like myself past and present opponents of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend lord gardiner for giving way <e> <s> i wonder whether he will recall statements for example which have been made in our previous debates by the noble and learned lord lord diplock and the late lord morris of borth-y-gest expressing very strong and quite severe fears about handing to the judges the powers that we have been discussing <e> <s> these are statements which have been made over the past couple of years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for introducing his bill and providing us with this further opportunity to consider the changes proposed <e> <s> it may be as he has said a modest measure but i think that the amendments of the law that it proposes are in fact significant and important <e> <s>

opening <e> <s> this session this second reading debate is taking place just under four weeks after the state opening <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to detain the committee for more than a moment or two <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord wigoder for having explained the purpose of these amendments <e> <s> the only observation i wish to add to his remarks is this <e> <s> i am very glad indeed and warmly welcome the fact that in the proposed amendment he has retained the criterion to which he has referred and in particular the use of the words in the interests of justice <e> <s> that is a phrase which appealed to a number of your lordships when on an earlier occasion a similar bill was being debated <e> <s> it is a well-known phrase which has stood the test of a considerable amount of time <e> <s> everybody perfectly understands it it was in the original bill that was proposed and i am very glad that it is retained in the amendment as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord wade for his very kind words and also to offer him warm congratulations on the way he has piloted this bill and the earlier ones through this house and on the enthusiasm and constant determination that he has shown in this cause <e> <s> without entering into the details of the merit of the bill tonight there is one thing that i would say about its possible passage through the other place and who knows the other place deciding to pass the bill <e> <s> and that is this <e> <s> it will be an occasion for at least some regret that there would then be no further cause for us to continue the club which we have formed which has continued for these past few years and which has been a very enjoyable one <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall see <e> <s> like the noble lord lord wade <e> <s> i do not want now to go into the detailed merits or otherwise of the bill but i should like to take up one matter arising from what he said tonight about the possible future parlia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord wigoder for his kind words and also to offer my congratulations from these benches both on having introduced this bill and on having piloted it through your lordships house so far <e> <s> although it is a modest measure in terms of length i nevertheless feel most strongly that if passed by parliament it will play a significant part in the administration of justice <e> <s> i only hope that your lordships will feel disposed to pass it and speed it on its way to another place where i hope too that it will be favourably received <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be indebted to the minister the noble lord lord belstead for his clear and concise explanation <e> <s> plainly inflation has taken its toll and therefore it seems that the proposed new limit is inevitable and inescapable and i would invite my noble friends to support it accordingly <e> <s> there is just one point that i should like to raise with the minister and that is whether this new limit is meant to last for some time that is whether it only brings us up to current prices or whether in putting forward a new limit of this kind some account is taken so far as that can be done of present and future rates of inflation so that a new limit might be expected to last for a little while instead of our having to introduce a further order within a limited time <e> <s> clearly the order is needed <e> <s> i think it is right to say that printing costs alone have again increased quite substantially and those take a substantial proportion of the amount that a candidate spends on his election expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for explaining the purposes of the order <e> <s> i hesitate to intervene in a northern ireland matter but i am comforted by the thought that my noble friend lord blease would be happy for me to join in commending the order to your lordships <e> <s> i have not had the pleasure of visiting the two institutions which the noble lord lord elton described at the beginning of his remarks <e> <s> they are quite clearly admirable institutions and among those who speak highly of them is my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge who as your lordships will know until quite recently had responsibilities as minister for the arts <e> <s> so it is with pleasure that i join in supporting this order <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to the noble viscount lord long for having explained the purposes of these orders <e> <s> in the circumstances that he has described the changes proposed are clearly desirable ones <e> <s> i should perhaps mention to your lordships that i have had the benefit of the advice of my noble friends who are most closely concerned in these matters including the noble lord lord blease and they are content that i should join in supporting these orders <e> <s> so it only remains for me to commend them to your lordships as the minister has done <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley i look forward to hearing what the noble lord lord belstead has to say about the points which have been raised <e> <s> i think many people will be in sympathy with the purposes of the amendments which the noble lord lord beaumont has tabled <e> <s> they have been put forward clearly with wholly praiseworthy and beneficial intentions <e> <s> however my fear when i saw that they had been tabled was that they might perhaps jeopardise the chances of the bill if it passed through your lordshps house and went to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham and others of your lordships in congratulating my noble friend lady wootton of abinger not only on her tenacity and indeed the compassion that she has brought to this matter again today but also on the new dimensions that she has brought to this debate for she has not merely repeated speeches which she has made on earlier occasions but in fact she has brought the results of her quite extensive research to this particular debate and also has presented to us new cases which i think have been most helpful to us all on whichever side our view lies <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble and learned friend lord gardiner i rise very briefly tonight to speak on the second reading of this bill briefly because of the extent of the business which is before your lordships tonight <e> <s> we are again indebted to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for this further initiative in family law and i should like to join the noble and learned lord lord scarman in commending the precision with which the noble and learned lord lord simon has explained this otherwise complex measure <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mcgregor of durris has performed a most valuable service in raising this matter today and in thanking him i should like to thank also all of the members of the committee for all their hard work <e> <s> this is an important subject and like my noble friend i shall be most interested to hear the views of the minister the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i must confess that on reading the report i did feel somewhat apprehensive about aspects of the draft directive <e> <s> i have been somewhat reassured by both what my noble friend himself has said and by what has been said by other noble lords including the noble and learned lord lord scarman in his speech <e> <s> but the reservations expressed by the home office in their memoranda are not insignificant ones and some of the matters to which they draw attention matters to which noble lords have referred in the course of this debate tonight not least on for example identity cards are likely to arouse a certain amount of controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gainford is to be congratulated on introducing the bill and the way in which he explained it and on having identified this anomaly in our licensing laws <e> <s> i think too it is a fact that our licensing laws are almost excruciatingly intricate and he has quite clearly mastered the complexities of this branch of our law <e> <s> on the other hand it does not necessarily follow that once an anomaly has been identified we should go ahead and reform the law automatically unless it can be shown that there is a problem that there is a way to solve it and that it ought to be solved <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are embarking on a course which i have no doubt we all regard as repugnant the consideration of an order to renew for another year the powers in the prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act <e> <s> i have no doubt at all and indeed it is perfectly clear from what he has said that the minister the <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the point i was seeking to make was this <e> <s> in the absence of a fresh inquiry into the working of the act that was the proposal which was called for in another place last wednesday an inquiry into the working of the act the proposal for the act to be brought forward as a bill next time if indeed it is still needed in a years time is i believe even more apposite so i would also ask the minister whether he would assure us that this suggestion will now be given further and most serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i was not tonight and i am sorry if i did not make it clear proposing an inquiry along those lines <e> <s> i was noting the fact that the point had been made in another place last week but because it had been rejected i was not putting it forward again today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> may i say first that i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate for his remarks about my noble friend lady wootton of abinger <e> <s> she is very sorry indeed not to be with your lordships tonight <e> <s> i am particularly sorry not only because of her illness but also because i am afraid that i am an inadequate replacement for her <e> <s> i am sure that we all join in wishing her a speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister the noble lord lord belstead for giving way <e> <s> i wonder whether he can help the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can ask for the indulgence of the committee in order not to speak again but to respond to the invitation which has just been made as to subsequent amendments <e> <s> i shall be joining in inviting your lordships to accept amendment no <e> <s> and the one which is linked with it <e>", "<cs> it might be of help to deal with this point straight away <e> <s> so far as adopted children are concerned as indeed my noble friend lady wootton made clear on previous occasions they are in precisely the same position and always would be whether this bill was an act or not as natural children <e> <s> there could never in any circumstances be any question of marriage in those cases <e>", "<cs> i am pleased and relieved that at this stage in our proceedings my noble friend and i are able to adopt a conciliatory approach even though and i would not be doing my duty if i did not add this with a certain amount of reluctance <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord robertson will not mind my saying that with i hope an abundance of grace if i can muster that because it will make his victory all the sweeter if he knows that it has not been a walk-over <e> <s> as he will know and as we have heard on previous occasions there are in fact quite substantial arguments against the course which is proposed here and which i support <e> <s> there was the report of the latey committee years ago into the age of majority <e> <s> that committee made many recommendations reducing the age of majority and for most purposes we have gradually applied full rights to people from the age of <e> <s> after all parliament reduced the voting age from to not so very long ago though i must confess that as a member of mr speakers conference on electoral law i was actually against that proposal when it was originally put forward and spoke against it when it came up for debate in another place <e> <s> so i can understand those who argue that now we should be consistent and stick to the age of for all possible purposes <e>", "<cs> as has been indicated this is indeed an important amendment and i want to say at the outset and i am sure my noble friend lady wootton too would wish me to say this that it has been put down with the best possible motives and if i may say so moved in that spirit by the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> perhaps i may also say that i am sure that the committee will be very much obliged certainly i am for what she has had to say about the tabling of the amendment and in that connection the difficulties about living in distant parts <e> <s> as she has indicated this amendment is somewhat similar to although as she says not entirely the same as one we debated two years ago when an identical bill was before your lordships <e> <s> a number of noble lords raised objections to it then on practical grounds including the noble viscount lord colville of culross <e> <s> i did too and i hope your lordships will forgive me if i refer to some of those objections again tonight and take a few moments to do so <e> <s> some of them indeed have been mentioned by the noble viscount lord hanworth in his speech to the committee <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank the noble viscount lord ingleby very much indeed for his kind words and also to say that it is perfectly clear and especially from what he has said that this amendment was tabled with the best of motives and with the best of intentions <e> <s> i think i should simply add this <e> <s> most of what i said on the last amendment on the principle of consent by the court and the applications to the court i should have said on this amendment so i do not think there is any need to detain your lordships so far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the right reverend prelate the bishop of winchester for the clear way in which he has explained the purposes of this amendment to the committee <e> <s> but for his speech i should have had two querries <e> <s> one would have been to invite him to inform your lordships about the present law so far as matters of this kind marriage generally and solemnisation by the clergy to whom he has referred are concerned <e> <s> secondly i should have asked him to clarify the position so far as the solemnisation or otherwise of the marriages of divorced persons is concerned <e> <s> from what he has said your lordships will appreciate as you know from the statute the right reverend prelate has mentioned that this amendment would not involve any new departure in other words we should not be creating by accepting <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister the noble lord lord belstead for inviting me to respond <e> <s> i have resolutely resisted throughout my legal life becoming involved and embroiled in what are to me the abstruse complexities of scottish law and i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i adhere to that principle <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for that generous offer and on behalf of my noble friend i would say i am sure that we should like to take advantage of the guidance and advice from the noble lords department <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is of course a most sombre one and there was indeed as we have seen both from the statement itself and from the reports over the weekend a very serious breakdown in law and order in brixton <e> <s> i join in condemning the appalling violence and the looting and the other criminal acts including the arson and the destruction that took place <e> <s> whatever the causes whatever the tensions whatever the frustrations there can be no excuse whatsoever for action of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has raised an important subject tonight and i am sure that we are grateful to him for that <e> <s> as a former permanent secretary at the home office he speaks with great authority on these matters <e> <s> in the course of his remarks he raised a number of particularly important matters within this whole subject the extent to which chief constables pay attention to police authorities accountability to which the noble lord lord inglewood has also addressed his remarks and the system of prosecutions <e> <s> all are matters on which we could have major debates <e> <s> i should like to follow him as far as all those particular parts of this subject are concerned but i shall resist the temptation in view of the hour <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point to begin with on which i would agree with the speech of the noble earl lord lauderdale on this amendment and that is the point at which he said that the definition of child of the family is one which is known to the law indeed it is well known <e> <s> i think that references were made to the fact that it is well known to the law in our last debates in committee by among others the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale when we were considering similar matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to examine the sort of cases which we might well find would arise <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about a proposed amendment to a bill which is not yet an act <e> <s> therefore if we are to do justice in debating this bill we have to contemplate cases which have yet to arise <e> <s> we must try to do justice to hypothetical cases and i am trying to join your lordships in doing both that is to say to acknowledge the very real and quite sizeable numbers of actual practical cases in being of the kind which the noble baroness lady wootton has placed before your lordships on previous occasions as well as tonight and also to try to do justice to the other half the hypothetical cases as well <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am delighted and relieved <e> <s> we should not overlook the fact that a child and this has been touched upon a little in tonights debate may be or may become a child of the family at any age at all <e> <s> there may be a tendency for people outside your lordships house to imagine a child of the family as being essentially a minor which would of course be a mistake <e> <s> there is no doubt that a time limit of this kind could prevent from marrying some of the very couples who my noble friends bill is designed to help some of the cases which we have felt to be especially deserving <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how the two statutory provisions line up my lords but the point i would make on that in connection with this measure one which on earlier occasions has been alluded to by my noble friend lord mishcon is that for these purposes an adopted child would anyway be in precisely the same position as a natural child of the couple concerned that is to say neither in the case of that natural child nor in the case of an adopted child could there ever in any circumstances whatever be any question of a marriage of that kind arising <e> <s> indeed the question of adoption is perhaps something which could be used more frequently to avoid difficulties arising in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for giving way and i hesitate to intervene in his speech along with others but i wonder whether he has considered the fact that your lordships were forewarned of the possible need to consider amendments of this bill because of the differences between scottish law and that of england and wales during the second reading speech by the noble lord lord belstead on th february last <e> <s> the noble lord referred specifically to the possible need for amendments and indeed he referred not only to the marriage laws but to the law of incest as it differs in scotland from the law in england and wales as well <e> <s> so i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would not agree that it is the case that your lordships were forewarned about these matters long since and were also forewarned about the possible need to consider matters of this kind as long ago as february at an earlier stage of one of my noble friends bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene on this matter concerning scottish law and i do not intend to do so on the details of scottish law because those i am quite sure will be explained to us by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate who is so familiar with scottish law <e> <s> but i do feel it is necessary to intervene to make this one point <e> <s> i think that those noble lords who <e>", "<cs> in scotland my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that very many people share the concern which has been expressed by the noble baroness and by himself about this matter and that the prospect of payments of this kind causes great indignation and distaste especially among the families of the victims of crime <e> <s> can he say whether at the moment the press council is in discussion with the government on this matter and whether it is coming forward with any proposals of its own <e> <s> may i ask him to accept that any legislative proposals that he may bring forward on behalf of the government will be warmly welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like in a moment to follow the noble lord lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords i think what my noble friend has just proved is that he is well able to speak for himself <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for explaining the purpose of the order <e> <s> i hope the fact that i cannot unfortunately claim any expertise in scottish law will not make my support for him and for his order any less acceptable to him <e> <s> it is with much pleasure that i join him in inviting your lordships to accept it <e>", "<cs> the information which has been provided by the minister the noble lord lord belstead is very helpful and i am very happy to join his noble friend the noble lord lord gainford in inviting your lordships to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord kinnoull on introducing this bill and on the considerable amount of work that he has put into it <e> <s> i should like to join him in commending his honourable friend the member for harrogate mr robert banks who was responsible for conducting the bill through its stages in the other place <e> <s> i join him also in the tribute he has paid to the various voluntary organisations which over the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord belstead for repeating that statement a grave one the gravity of which is compounded whether or not the various incidents are in any way connected and we must be careful to distinguish between them by the fact that it is the second time in less than three months that a statement of this kind has been necessary and again there has been a serious breakdown in law and order <e> <s> i ask the minister to accept that we join in condemning in the strongest possible terms the criminal acts violence arson looting and wanton destruction and let it be clearly understood whatever were the immediate or underlying causes of tension frustration anxiety or indeed provocation that there can be no justification or excuse whatever for these appalling acts <e> <s> nothing at all can condone them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will approve the order and i should like to thank the minister the noble lord lord sandys for so clearly explaining its purposes <e> <s> if the order were not passed a number of significant charities would suffer considerably as indeed would those people whom the bodies seek to help since to a considerable extent they are dependent on money raised through the means provided under the governing act <e> <s> however it must be said and i think that this was implicit in what the minister himself said tonight that it is a pity that parliament is still having to consider annual extensions of the act instead of being able to rely on permanent legislative provisions <e> <s> as the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble and learned lord for explaining the order <e> <s> these orders tend to be introduced every three or four years so the introduction of this one as the lord chancellor indicated is in line with the established trend and i hope your lordships will approve it <e> <s> i also wish to endorse what the noble and learned lord said about the immense importance and value of the county courts in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could add my congratulations to those just expressed by the noble and learned lord and from these benches join him in his tribute to the noble viscount lord colville of culross and to his honourable friend in another place mr miscampbell <e> <s> they have indeed performed a very great service to parliament to the profession and to the public generally in steering this very valuable bill through the two houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for repeating that statement <e> <s> we all share in the sense of outrage at this despicable cowardly and criminal attack and join in condemning it totally <e> <s> we have all too often had occasion in this house to praise the work of the bomb disposal experts the police and the other emergency services <e> <s> those expressions of our gratitude and admiration have been just as heartfelt when there has been no injury or loss of life as when there has been <e> <s> but yesterdays incident really does show all too clearly how completely justified are our praise and admiration <e> <s> we hope that the deep sympathy we all feel can be passed on to the relatives of mr kenneth howorth a most courageous man <e> <s> we also join in expressing our deep sympathy to the others who suffered from this attack and from the other attacks that the minister has mentioned <e> <s> once again we join in praising the work of the services i have referred to <e> <s> perhaps i could join in commending the high example in terms of both courage and devotion to duty set by general sir steuart pringle which was not only an outstanding example to his men but i believe to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to the minister the noble lord lord belstead for outlining the governments reasons for introducing the order and he has clone so with his usual clarity <e> <s> but i should be less than frank with the house if i said that i was grateful that the order itself had been introduced <e> <s> it is i believe regrettable that the government have decided to ask parliament to postpone the repeal of this act the imprisonment temporary provisions act for months and to keep it in being for another year <e> <s> it is regrettable first that parliament is being asked to retain legislation of this kind now by order and secondly that the government consider that the situation in our prisons is such that this step is necessary and justified <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord foot sits down and although i hesitate to cross swords with him because i agree with him on so many legal matters i did wonder in his general approach to the order before your lordships whether his attention had been drawn to the remarks made by his honourable friend the member for the isle of wight mr stephen ross in another place last night when the order was debated there <e> <s> mr ross said that he bitterly opposed the renewal of this legislation he opposed it when it was first introduced and he always felt that section was the only part of it which was necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to congratulate my noble friend lord willis on introducing this bill and on all the work that he has done on it <e> <s> it is a subject which he has been studying for several years so it is not just a passing interest of his or to use modern jargon an instant interest <e> <s> in fact he was considering this matter as long ago as the time when my honourable friend mr bruce george the member for walsall south was involved in his bill the private security registration bill to which my noble friend has referred this evening and which was introduced in another place <e> <s> whatever view one takes of the bill before us today there is no doubt that there are public concern and interest in the matter so my noble friend has performed a service already in enabling us to debate it <e> <s> i should like also to pay tribute to my honourable friend mr george for the enormous amount of research he has done on the subject and in producing his useful report <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the subject matter of this bill which deals with the fire service it should have been possible for me to think up something inflammatory to say <e> <s> however i am afraid that i have to disappoint the noble lord the minister and your lordships <e> <s> either as a result of being captivated by the gentle persuasiveness of the noble lord lord belstead or being overcome by the approach of the season of good will or both i find myself unable to oppose the purposes of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the number of fires has been increasing in recent years <e> <s> can he give any indication of the proportion of fires which appear to have been started deliberately <e> <s> and is he satisfied that everything possible is being done by way both of the adequacy of supervision staff and of precautions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that that is a disappointing reply and in view of the importance that the government attach to these matters especially at a time when the prison population is increasing that there should in fact be increased expenditure on these services especially because of the importance of resettlement <e> <s> would the minister also accept that part-time training and education is an important part of these services and that it is regrettable that there has been a substantial decrease in the number of part-time staff <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether the government intend to remedy these losses <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help so far as the new rgime on youth custody is concerned and whether it is intended that the present six hours per week of evening tuition which is at the moment enshrined in the borstal training rules will be continued under the new rgime when it is introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords the more that we are called upon to debate orders of the kind that is before your lordships this afternoon the more distasteful the experience becomes and none of us relishes the prospect of debating the renewal of this temporary legislation <e> <s> i have not the slightest doubt about that <e> <s> we regard the legislation as repugnant principally i suppose because of the appalling nature of the criminal acts which led to the introduction of these laws in the first place and the acts which have been perpetrated since then and which have led to the repeated renewal of the legislation <e> <s> i am sure that we are united on that <e> <s> i hope and feel certain that we are also united in the view that these laws are unpalatable because they offend the rights freedoms and liberties which we in this country hold dear and the minister the noble lord lord belstead was right to acknowledge that yet again today <e> <s> i should like to thank him too for his valuable and comprehensive survey of the operation of the act over the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down i wonder whether he will accept one small correction in my own remarks i referred to the taking of hostages bill as having received the royal assent yesterday <e> <s> in fact it passed through your lordships house and received a third reading here before going on to another place to be considered there <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord bishopston for that correction <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many district councils have responded and drawn up plans <e> <s> would he accept from these benches our warm congratulations on his appointment and perhaps he might also if i am not out of order in suggesting it find a way of conveying to his predecessor in the home office our congratulations on his appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls upon introducing this bill and perhaps also join him in offering congratulations to his honourable friend mr michael brown the member for brigg and scunthorpe for the success that he achieved in piloting the bill through another place <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister bear in mind that there is growing and widespread concern about the matter <e> <s> while the minister has clearly indicated to the house the current state of legislation it does not quite go so far as i think the noble lord lord wigoder had in mind namely whether the minister is satisfied that those measures which he has mentioned to the house this morning are adequate to deal with the very problems which he has indicated <e> <s> can he go a stage further so far as the interesting point about classification which he mentioned is concerned and say whether the government will give very serious consideration to it <e> <s> perhaps he would also bear in mind the need to deal with the problem of video-cassette piracy which is not unconnected with these matters <e>", "<cs> the second part of my question concerned the question of video cassette piracy and the need to bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that i and i am sure all members of your lordships house have an immense amount of respect for his honourable and learned friend the minister of state mr mayhew and indeed for the abilities of the noble lord lord elton which are <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> we would also extend our thanks for the speed with which assistant commissioner john dellow has reported <e> <s> the extreme gravity of this statement is all too plain <e> <s> it reveals a deplorable and astonishing sequence of failures which amounts to a devastating indictment of security at buckingham palace and the minister and the home secretary have been commendably forthcoming about this <e> <s> setting aside the defence of the realm itself and all that that implies when it comes to personal security there can be no higher priority than the protection of the sovereign the head of state <e> <s> we must i think all accept here i agree with the noble lord lord elton that it is not possible ever to safeguard against every conceivable contingency <e> <s> that course would not be acceptable to the queen and would thwart the basic aims of our free democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for raising this matter tonight <e> <s> in doing so he has performed a most valuable service and he brings a vast amount of experience and knowledge on the whole subject and in particular this matter to our debates on these questions <e> <s> the service that he has performed is a valuable one because as we have heard tonight from a number of your lordships the work done at grendon forms a very important and indeed unique role within our prison service and any threat to its capacity to continue and to develop that work causes very serious concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to impose my impatience upon the noble lord and upon the house <e> <s> but it is specifically a current point which he touched upon a moment ago that i wish to refer to <e> <s> he correctly repeated the words i used in saying that i referred to an undeniably laudable aim the treatment of further people who are in need of the sort of treatment that grendon provides <e> <s> but he will bear in mind that i immediately went on to say that i felt that to impose such people upon the rgime there at this juncture by increasing the numbers would create the risk i described in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords one matter on which i feel sure we are all united today is that it is regrettable that we still are having to debate the retention of legislation of this kind <e> <s> we regret it i believe for two main reasons <e> <s> first because there continue to be acts of terrorism grotesque and indeed obscene acts which it seeks to prevent <e> <s> over the past year we have seen once again since the last time we renewed this legislation further acts including those to which the noble lord lord elton has already referred in the london parks last summer in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome the bill and to thank the minister the noble lord lord elton for explaining its provisions to your lordships <e> <s> it is in some respects a somewhat technical measure and the minister has spelt out the details with his customary clarity <e> <s> the bill is welcome because it represents if it is not inapposite to put it in this way one more weapon in our necessary armoury for combating terrorism and indeed other crimes which have no terrorist connection <e>", "<cs> my lords after the vast range of different subjects your lordships have been called on to grapple with today it comes as something of a relief to have reached this particular subject and that is not just because it is the final item on the order paper it is much more because after all that has gone before your lordships are perhaps in need of refreshment and that is precisely what this bill provides for <e> <s> so it is a congenial topic i think to reach just before the easter recess <e>", "<cs> my lords even though the libyan authorities have denied any responsibility for these outrages can the minister say whether there has been any expression of regret at all or indeed of condemnation from the libyan authorities about them <e> <s> can he also say whether her majestys government have been able to clarify the position in regard to who is running the bureau in london and whether they are satisfied both about the identity and about the number of people at that mission <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers reply to the questions asked by the noble lord lord gladwyn mean that the government have already gone rather further than is indicated towards the end of the home secretarys statement on initiating international discussions with the object of a review of the vienna convention <e> <s> if that is so it would certainly be very warmly welcomed in many quarters as the scale and nature of international terrorism has undergone great changes since the convention was brought into effect <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that those international discussions will not only cover dealing with abuses of the diplomatic bag but will also deal with the practices and procedures for checking upon the status and identity of the occupants of missions and indeed of the missions themselves <e> <s> would he not agree that one of the lessons to be learnt from last weeks barbaric outrage is that to use an inadequate word we cannot tolerate unorthodox missions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister reconsider one point which he made in one of his replies just now that is the outcome which is sought by members of your lordships house <e> <s> many of us would hope that vengeance would not form a part of british law however proper that feeling within us might well be <e> <s> what is sought i should have thought by all members of your lordships house is justice <e> <s> can he say more specifically whether the two persons who have been identified one of them as having been likely to have committed this outrageous crime were subjected to the customary scrutiny that any proposed occupant of a mission even one of this kind should have been and customarily is subjected to and whether in the course of that any shortcomings were revealed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister throw further light on the events between the outrages in march and those on the th and th april <e> <s> i believe that the statement deals with matters up to the middle of march when the march outrages took place but it then goes straight to the events of th april <e> <s> the noble baroness has already implied that the government indicated to the libyan authorities i think the words were that they would be unable to continue to deal with them unless the mission in london was placed on a firmer footing <e> <s> was any kind of deadline set by her majestys government on that point as to the length of time allowed to put the mission on a proper footing <e> <s> and between those dates that is to say between mid-march and th april and indeed th april was any further pressure exerted by the government on the libyan authorities to put matters right at the libyan bureau <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be the view of the objectivity or otherwise of those who have made assessments of these studies would the minister accept that one view arising out of the studies seems to be that even a limited nuclear exchange in the northern hemisphere would have quite devastating climatic effects in the southern hemisphere as well and does that not at the very least mean that the need for international agreement on control and balanced reduction of forces is all the more urgent <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often happens in your lordships house this debate has taken an even more interesting and powerful turn than might have been expected beforehand by the subject matter <e> <s> first i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord paget of northampton for providing this opportunity to discuss this matter today <e> <s> whatever view is taken about the particular matters he has raised especially the detention of bishop muzorewa and the other disturbing matters about which we have heard this afternoon i hope that we can all agree on one thing that we all hope for the success of zimbabwe and the zimbabwean people <e> <s> i say that because we on this bench and i am sure elsewhere in your lordships house approach this matter with that basic aim in mind in a constructive way <e> <s> i should also add at the outset that i propose to concentrate on the matters referred to in my noble friends motion the judiciary and bishop muzorewa <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how long it is expected that the consideration he said is being given to these matters is likely to take <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the hilarity would the minister accept that while wanting to keep him on his toes in this question we do not intend that he shall get too much of a kick out of it <e> <s> can the minister say how the production costs of this new boot compare with the production costs of the old one <e> <s> can the noble lord also throw some light on the following matter <e> <s> the noble lord has already confirmed to the house that one of the advantages of the new boot is that it is more waterproof than the old one <e> <s> but some of us have been mystified by what appears to be the drainage system in the new boot and the claim that should water get in it lets it out more easily <e> <s> we are wondering whether there is any connection perhaps with tap-dancing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that as part of the governments campaign to buy british wherever possible it is desirable to set an example <e> <s> can he say whether if this particular alternative is chosen that would in fact involve new factories in places of high unemployment such as scotland and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the minister the noble lord lord trefgarne for introducing this debate on the defence estimates and for doing so in his usual clear and definite way <e> <s> it is a measure of the importance attached to this matter that we have not only our own <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness the minister accept that what she said about the reference to nuclear disarmament at the london summit last weekend is very welcome <e> <s> however can she say whether any concrete and precise proposals were discussed at that summit meeting to try to get the geneva talks resumed and to try to get the soviet union back to the negotiating table <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say whether there are yet any grounds for optimism that the talks which have been broken off as a result of the withdrawal of the soviet union will be resumed at an early date <e> <s> can he also say what follow-up action the government propose to take in concert with our allies to try to resume those talks following the expressions of hope at the london summit that they will be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the review which he has mentioned so far as the royal irish rangers are concerned concentrates mainly on training as part of his ministrys present efficiency drive or whether it goes more widely than that <e>", "<cs> my lords in saying that it is hoped that the british share will be an important share can the minister say whether the implications for jobs in this country arising out of the new aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not regrettable that two of these royal marine bands are to be disbanded or abandoned <e> <s> will that not be greeted with very great regret indeed throughout the country <e> <s> and would the minister not agree that apart from their strictly service role which not only includes their normal service duties but also includes the very big part that they play so far as morale is concerned these bands also have a much wider public role in the public relations service which they perform <e> <s> will the minister at least confirm that that particular role will be borne very much in mind so far as the future of these bands is concerned and will he reconsider and ask his right honourable friend to reconsider the position of the bands as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that what all of these supplementary questions really amount to is that the royal marines bands ought to be allowed to continue their various ceremonial functions and that really it ought to be the government who should be solely confined to beating retreat <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government made any estimate of whether the security needs of the area have changed at all as a result of the breakdown of the talks <e> <s> are we as capable of fulfilling our commitments to the falklands and in that area now as we were before the talks took place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that whatever the merits of the argument that it was necessary to sink the belgrano because she posed a threat to our task force and there is much to commend the argument that that had to be the overriding consideration at the time nevertheless the matter cannot simply be brushed aside on that basis and that the government should have been more forthcoming much earlier about the information surrounding those circumstances <e> <s> would he like to comment on a report that the noble and gallant lord lord levin said last week that it is highly likely that her majestys government were informed verbally at the time that the attack took place that the belgrano had changed course <e> <s> is not this an argument at the very least for a supplementary falklands white paper to be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to pursue this point with the noble minister <e> <s> as he has said and as has been reported his point about documentary evidence appears to be correct but my question and the noble and gallant lords observation was directed to his recollection of a verbal communication to the war cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn has performed a most useful service to the house in raising this matter <e> <s> his first-hand and direct knowledge and experience of this subject makes it all the more valuable <e> <s> i join my noble friend lord mulley the noble lord lord kennet and the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls in welcoming the introduction of this subject <e> <s> not only is it highly topical for the two reasons which have already been mentioned namely the meeting of the permanent council at the end of last week of the western european union at which i was pleased to see the foreign and commonwealth secretary sir geoffrey howe and the secretary of state for defence mr heseltine were present and also the meeting of the assembly of the western european union which is taking place today <e> <s> both of these sessions mark the th anniversary of the western european union <e> <s> it is also highly topical because it follows swiftly upon the state visit last week of president mitterrand <e> <s> it was he who took the initiative in putting forward proposals for reactivating the western european union <e> <s> therefore this debate is most timely <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to the minister for repeating the answer as his statement <e> <s> is this not a most bizarre turn of events <e> <s> i was almost tempted to say change of course in this saga but it is a little too serious for that i think <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been taking place in the aftermath of the cruel murder of mrs indira gandhi and in the shadow of the appalling tragedy in ethiopia two terrible events that have been in the minds of your lordships today <e> <s> i join in the tributes to mrs gandhi and in the welcome to the efforts of the government and others to bring aid to those suffering in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should love to follow the noble lord lord kennet into further discussion of these matters but i fear i should be trespassing a little too much perhaps i have done so already upon the kindness of the house <e> <s> however if i were to be tempted down that path one of the things to bring into our discussions would be the rejection at the liberal assembly in bournemouth of mr david steels call about cruise <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that there is unanimity of view not only among the members of the board but also among the presidents and deans comprising the conference of colleges that there should be the fullest co-operation among the ministry of defence the royal colleges and the department of health and social security to ensure that the quality of doctors in the armed forces is maintained at the highest level in the world and that they are also unanimous in their view that the abolition of the board would be a retrograde step <e> <s> will he invite his right honourable friend to have another look at this and to hold open the possibility of resurrecting the board <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that while it is important to keep costs down as far as possible it is also important to maintain standards <e> <s> furthermore is he satisfied that smaller companies in particular have the necessary facilities for maintaining control over standards and avoiding any danger to national security <e> <s> also what on-the-spot checks are made to safeguard those two matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady young for introducing this order and for explaining its provisions in her characteristically clear way and in such concise terms too <e> <s> i should also like to welcome the order itself <e> <s> it marks a further stage in the development of what i believe are productive and happy relations between our country and the peoples republic of china and it represents another tangible example of the way in which these relations have been developing <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister put these figures into a little better perspective perhaps by saying what proportion of the total manpower of the ministry of defence they comprise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that it is time that a more accurate figure was given for the cost of trident and that her majestys government should no longer go on stating the cost as though the exchange rate of the pound was still dollars <e> <s> is it not the case that a growing body of opinion including expert and service opinion hopes that this project will be cancelled because of the way that it is preventing us from making a much more effective conventional contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords that will not do if i may say so to the noble lord <e> <s> is it not the case that a very simple arithmetical calculation could be made immediately by bearing in mind that the exchange rate is no longer dollars to the pound but is at the moment approximately to the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say anything about the extent to which claims for compensation are still anticipated and in particular about how those relate to merchant shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not invite the minister to include me in that anyway <e> <s> can he confirm that local authorities are not involved in this exercise <e> <s> if that is the case can he say why they are not being involved in view of the fact that according to mr stanley in another place last year the intention of the exercise is to cover the whole spectrum of a crisis and it is somewhat difficult to see why local authorities should not be involved in view of the civil defence aspects of this <e>", "<cs> my lords may we on this bench say how nice it is to see the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor back among us and restored to health <e> <s> is it not the case that when trident was first announced <e> <s> her majestys government expected that some per cent <e> <s> of the costs would be spent in this country and only per cent <e> <s> in the united states <e> <s> also is it not the case that now as announced last year in the defence white paper it is down to only per cent <e> <s> in our favour as has been said this afternoon and per cent <e> <s> in the united states favour <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister say what is being done to redress this imbalance if this regrettable project is to be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister may be acquitted as regards those figures and his own involvement should not the government have corrected the <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has been careful to say that there are circumstances in which he could envisage our nuclear weapons being used independently <e> <s> can he say whether he envisages circumstances in which they would be used independently <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in my question i was not asking him to specify circumstances in which these weapons might be used and that i recognise the point he made in that connection <e> <s> i was simply asking him to say whether there were circumstances in which they would be used independently <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that as has been reported in the last hour or so the talks planned to start tomorrow will go ahead as arranged despite the regrettable death of mr chernenko <e> <s> also may we join her majestys government in expressions of sympathy to the soviet union and to mr chernenkos family <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord mayhew and other noble lords in complimenting the noble lord lord gladwyn on taking what i am tempted to call his own sdi his strategic debating initiative tonight <e> <s> it was i thought a timely initiative when he tabled his unstarred question and it is even more timely now partly in view of the speech which has been referred to by the noble lord lord mayhew and by my noble friend lord molloy of the foreign and commonwealth secretary last friday week to the royal united service institution and i shall return to that speech shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say anything more about the terms of reference of this initiative <e> <s> can she say whether it would serve not only the weu itself but the other western european defence organisations <e> <s> does she not agree that there is a need for greater co-ordination of and co-operation on the western defence effort <e> <s> has any estimate been made of the cost of this <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness accept that not only is the foreign and commonwealth secretary to be commended on the successful service of visits he has just made but he is to be congratulated on the considerable courage that he showed in some of the contacts that he made in east and central europe not least in poland <e> <s> can she say whether we can hold out any hope that there will not only be greater movement of people from west to east but there will be greater movement of individuals from east to west as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord kennet and all other noble lords who have so far taken part in the debate in saying that the noble lord lord reay has performed a very valuable service in raising the matter tonight not least because it is clearly a good moment to do so with the resumption of talks on chemical weapons in the -nation conference on disarmament in geneva earlier this year and the further initiative taken only last month on th march by her majestys government when the minister of state at the foreign and commonwealth office mr richard luce tabled his new practical proposals on verification <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot promise to agree with all that the noble lord lord reay said <e> <s> that he has provided a timely and very useful occasion for this debate is beyond question <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to the minister for explaining the purposes of the two orders <e> <s> both deal with international immunities and privileges so it is indeed appropriate to take them together <e> <s> i hope that it will be no less acceptable to your lordships if i say straight away that on behalf of noble lords on these benches i am able to welcome the orders and need not detain your lordships more than a few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that his robust answer to the question of the noble lord lord paget will be widely welcomed as indeed has been indicated by my noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> does he agree that it is regrettable that speedier progress has not been made towards independence as has been noted by the meeting recently in new delhi of the non-aligned movement <e> <s> can he say what further steps are contemplated by the western contact group to try to get things moving further <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that in any consultations that take place with our allies the government will continue to impress upon our allies their view and decision that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister the noble lord lord trefgarne for introducing this debate on the defence estimates in his customarily clear and competent way and also for his <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord who has considerable knowledge of these matters as a former minister in the ministry of defence that is a point which has been put repeatedly from the front bench opposite <e> <s> it is no excuse to stick to an out-of-date exchange rate when we know the up-to-date exchange rate <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down i would ask him in view of the extraordinary and astonishing attack that he has made upon the noble and gallant lord lord carver upon the noble lord lord kennet and upon myself to reflect on this <e> <s> if he heard the three speeches that were made by those members of your lordships house last week he certainly did not listen to them <e> <s> and if he read those three speeches he certainly did not take in what he was reading <e> <s> the view that he has given of those three speeches could hardly be further from reality <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for introducing this order and also for incorporating the explanation of it in his speech on the defence white paper <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that having had two full days on the defence estimates it would be a trifle unbecoming to prolong unduly the defence debate tonight especially as there is other important business to follow <e> <s> therefore i have just two or three points to ask him about in connection with the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend lord rea and all other noble lords who have spoken in this debate in congratulating my noble friend lord brockway on initiating it <e> <s> few people inside or outside this house are more steeped in the policies of disarmament or more vigorous in the cause of disarmament and peace and over such a prolonged period <e> <s> as we shall not be sitting on st november perhaps we may be forgiven for anticipating that day and expressing the hope that my noble friend lord brockway will have a very happy th birthday <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement and we quite understand about the unavoidable absence of his noble friend lord trefgarne who is i understand visiting the ghurkas in nepal <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout this debate above all we have been conscious of one thing the summit in geneva in days time <e> <s> i join my noble friend lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady young in hoping for success <e> <s> we are almost afraid to hope yet we know that there is a deep desire in fact a yearning among people throughout the world for something a breakthrough leading to real progress towards solving one of the worlds greatest problems the search for arms control and disarmament not only for its own sake but also because that would make us all the more able to deal with the worlds other greatest problems poverty starvation and disease <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the reductions in germany have had some effect on morale <e> <s> is it not precisely within that sphere to which the minister has just referred that effects have <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is important to safeguard the anti-ballistic missile treaty <e> <s> can he say whether the government have evidence that the soviet union has violated that treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that he has also taken the wind out of the sails of these benches as well by his his very encouraging answer <e> <s> will he accept that those of us who have had the privilege of seeing the development at mount pleasant airport through arrangements made by the noble lord lord trefgarne have found it very impressive <e> <s> although there are the facilities for recreation that he has mentioned is he aware that none would be more useful nor i suspect more used than that to which the noble lord lord tordoff has referred <e> <s> the reply is encouraging <e> <s> will the minister continue to press for that development to take place at the earliest possible date <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble minister accept that the supplementary question posed by my noble friend lord cledwyn about a comprehensive test-ban treaty was in fact well within the terms of the question on the order paper because one of the subjects which it was envisaged that it might <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said these were matters which could be raised in geneva <e> <s> would she say whether in fact they are going to be raised there <e> <s> on president reagans recent invitation to the soviet union to view new verification procedures in nevada next month does she not feel that the very fact the president has issued that invitation is a further indication that there is overwhelming evidence that verification is no longer a problem and therefore there is no longer any reason to delay a resumption of talks for a comprehensive test ban treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hatch of lusby who has considerable knowledge of southern africa has again performed a service in introducing another bill seeking to ensure that her majestys government do all within their power to secure the independence of namibia <e> <s> i think that has merged throughout this debate from all sides that it is desirable that her majestys government should do everything within their power to secure the independence of that territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble friend said <e> <s> indeed i was about to come to that point <e> <s> linkage it has to be said is very convenient for south africa in some ways and some would say too for the united states <e> <s> it enables south africa to delay the independence of namibia on the grounds of national security it enables the united states to protect against feared soviet incursion into africa <e> <s> it is convenient because south africa and again it could be said the united states are able to manipulate the duration of this remaining obstacle by their support of mr savimbi and his unita followers <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say a little more about why there have not been discussions with our other allies in europe <e> <s> is it perhaps because some of them at least are understandably more reluctant than her majestys government to become involved in the strategic defence initiative either in principle or because they do not see any commercial or financial advantages in it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there are any nuclear weapons in this country which are subject to physical dual control <e> <s> if that is not the case why not <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether her majestys government are contemplating any agreement with the united states along the lines of the one reported to have been made between chancellor kohl of west germany and the united states which i understand to be that west germany would be prepared to station binary weapons on its soil at a time of imminent crisis <e> <s> can the minister say further whether the prime minister has given an undertaking to chancellor kohl along those lines and if so how can that be squared with his statement of government policy on rd may last year that we are not contemplating resuming possession of these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will forgive me for returning to the dispatch box <e> <s> however does the answer given by the noble lord to my last supplementary question mean that no such undertaking has been given by the prime minister or any member of the government to chancellor kohl <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not accept that what she has said particularly in answer to the first two questions is very welcome <e> <s> will she bear in mind that a representative of the united nations

investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged <e> <s> will the minister consider making a further statement to the house about that report when further details become available <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that there is indeed a need to condemn terrorism of all kinds including libyan terrorism <e> <s> has she noted the widespread and authoritative view that the action

inevitably be <e> <s> the great problem upon which we do not all agree is how to bring it about and how long it should take <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that this visit is very welcome in that it is a significant development in the dialogue between our two countries <e> <s> will she also accept that her announcement yesterday that the subject of chemical weapons is to be included in the talks is welcome <e> <s> can she perhaps say more about the statement which was made during his moscow visit by the noble viscount the leader of the house that mr gorbachev had been taking a new and more positive approach to this matter <e> <s> have there therefore been some developments on the russian side since the ones to which she referred which took place in april <e>",

amendments proposed by my noble friend lady birk and the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> i also support the two amendments proposed by the noble earl lord stockton in the name of the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> it is very encouraging that the noble earl lord ferrers has already indicated that he is able to accept <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but i shall do so briefly <e> <s> at the outset of my remarks just now i said that i wished to say something about amendment no <e> <s> hb proposed by the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> i very much support the observations that he made about it <e> <s> there is here a not insignificant legal problem which ought to be looked at further <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble earl will seek to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the government chief whip <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that a list is not kept in these circumstances <e> <s> how is the owner of the documents to be sure that he will receive any of them back <e> <s> he is entitled to get them back <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris <e> <s> the noble lord lord colwyn also wanted to be here tonight and to speak in support of the amendment <e> <s> he told me that he has no objection to that being mentioned <e> <s> indeed he intended to have his name added to the amendment but for some unknown reason that did not happen <e> <s> as we know the noble lord lord colwyn has been playing a thorough part in the committees proceedings including earlier today <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the comments of the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> there should be no question of his feeling a need to apologise to the committee for intervening several times on this vital matter <e>", "<cs> to add to that the basic point which the noble lord lord rees-mogg makes is a fair point <e> <s> but the difficulty is that the committee has no idea whatever what will be considered to be appropriate <e> <s> therefore that particular ground i am afraid falls on that basis <e>", "<cs> there is a further point in this connection one which has not as yet been mentioned <e> <s> i refer members of the committee to clause which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord blake intervened just now i was about to rise to point out that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter had suggested that the only people to speak in support of these amendments were those in whose names the amendments had been tabled <e> <s> i wished also to say that the last thing i wanted to do was to disappoint the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> however the noble lord lord blake has already intervened and has done just that <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will not feel that he has been disappointed <e> <s> whether or not i shall disappoint him remains to be seen <e> <s> he and i will have to listen to what i have to say to discover whether or not it is disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the volume of the voices around the house just now i took it that it might have been the will of the house that i should have intervened before the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford made his speech <e> <s> however i felt it appropriate not to persist in seeking to do so <e> <s> i have however placed myself in a difficulty <e> <s> i was seeking to intervene on the very point which my noble friend lord mishcon referred to which concerns i hope i may call it this a subsidiary matter to the major debate we expected to embark upon this afternoon <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers courteously and if i may say so very properly replied to that matter <e> <s> the difficulty i therefore have placed myself in now is that should the debate which we were expecting develop further i might in intervening in this way need to seek the leave of the house to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord bonham-carter and supported by my noble friend lord ardwick and the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> i should like to join the noble lord lord bonham-carter in praising itn for having established such a high reputation over the years as one of the worlds leading news services <e> <s> i would prefer a per cent <e> <s> split with the present shareholders retaining the majority holding but i am prepared to go along with the sponsors of the amendment in this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for the amendment moved by <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth in stating that the noble earl should not apologise for spelling out in some detail the governments explanation for these matters <e> <s> equally i hope that he will forgive me if i take a little time to mention points that are of concern to the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only to support my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth in warmly commending her majestys government for including provisions on networking <e> <s> all that the noble lord has said is absolutely right and the need for a good networking system is of fundamental importance to the viewer whose interests we all seek to serve <e> <s> therefore i believe as does my noble friend that it is important to say that this matter of networking is an example of the improvements which her majestys government have made to this bill <e> <s> the government have shown their flexibility and their willingness to listen <e> <s> thanks are due to the noble earl lord ferrers to his right honourable friend mr mellor and indeed to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris and supported so persuasively by the noble lord lord plowden with all his experience <e> <s> i do not propose to cover in detail the main arguments raised in committee by various noble lords <e> <s> some have been mentioned tonight by the noble lord lord mcgregor and others by the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> however it is important to underline some of the major arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down i wish to put this point to him <e> <s> throughout our debates both in committee and on report repeated references have been made by the noble earl lord ferrers by my noble friends on the front bench lady birk and lady ewart-biggs by my noble friend lord ardwick by the noble lords lord thomson of monifieth and lord bonham-carter and other noble lords in all parts of your lordships house both on the government benches the cross-benches and by members on this side of the chamber to the plain and simple fact which i have also joined in pointing out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl and i hesitate to interrupt him <e> <s> i was asking not about the interpretation of the itc code but about the way in which the bsc proposes to work and in particular about the interpretation of the word appropriate <e> <s> how will it give guidance and interpret whether or not a complaint is appropriate or inappropriate when it comes to considering it or ruling it out from its consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as at second reading in committee and on report i declare an interest as chairman of tvs entertainment plc and of its subsidiary tvs television limited which holds the independent television franchise for the south and south east of england <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford is entitled to his view <e> <s> i am basing my views on those of three leading counsel and another authoritative lawyer who has already spoken to your lordships this afternoon <e> <s> the very fact that there are differences of view underlines the fact of the problem here <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships more than a few moments <e> <s> as my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth said the matter was explored on report and to an extent although perhaps using slightly different words in committee as well <e> <s> i hope very much that since our debate on this matter last tuesday the government will have reflected further and will see that they have no cause whatever to fear that a quota system will be needed for this proposal to be implemented <e> <s> the government have been under a misapprehension on this matter both in committee and on report <e> <s> the itva has made it quite clear both the association and the iba shadow itc support this amendment that there is no question whatever of guarantees or quotas for the supply to the network <e> <s> the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister and my noble friend lady birk for their generous remarks about me <e> <s> i also congratulate the minister on the way in which he has conducted the bill through your lordships house with great expertise and charm <e> <s>
