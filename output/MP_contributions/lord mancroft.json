["<cs> my lords in the course of his entertaining and most welcome maiden speech the noble marquess lord ailesbury made it perfectly clear that he does not like the advertising profession <e> <s> as

to correct some of the errors of his thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add a few words of support to the bill which has been moved in such an able way by my noble friend lord newall

not even bother to come and look at a greyhound racing track <e> <s> i think one or two of their staff did but if the whole commission came they must have come on my night off <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to offer a few words of welcome to this excellent and most useful bill <e> <s> by coincidence it comes before your lordships house at a time when a perfect example of something the

the days when i played in the gardens there as a child <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i should like to point out that i was speaking of years ago <e> <s> perhaps the fuss i made then has made the noble lord behave in such a splendid way now <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to take up one minute of your lordships time on a procedural point <e> <s> i will take no more than one

bill of the noble baroness lady phillips although i am sure i shall be told that it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the noble and learned lord lord simon did not exaggerate when he told us with what pleasure we should listen to <e>", "<cs> before we leave this point may i make a short comment on the observation of the noble lord who was speaking from the liberal front bench about glossy brochures in annual reports <e> <s> there has always been criticism of these and it is very easy to criticise <e> <s> companies do not do this lightheartedly they go into it very carefully <e> <s> shareholders know perfectly well that these reports must be expensive to produce take time and trouble and cost considerable postage <e> <s> on the other hand speaking from my own experience i can assure the noble lord that many shareholders welcome detailed information about their companies in language which they can understand and with pictures showing what is going on rather than a piece of paper which only a qualified accountant can possibly explain to them <e> <s> as the noble lord lord monson suggested they may live miles if not miles from the nearest qualified accountant <e>", "<cs> my lords as an ordinary back-bencher and a former member of the bar a long time ago may i endorse what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has just said about the length of time that some cases are taking <e> <s> there are complicated cases which cannot be adjudicated in an afternoon but when one gets cases going on for three or four months dealing with what appears to the man in the street to be quite humble not very important matters though of course they are important for the people concerned that is not only bad for the parties concerned and for the administration of justice but it brings justice into disrepute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> i said that i did not know the answer <e> <s> i said that perhaps the lord chancellor knows the answer but i do not know it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in congratulating my noble friend lady trumpington for the able way in which she introduced the debate and in warning her if she

shops bill <e> <s> it never became an act and that may have been my fault because i remember spending nearly minutes trying to persuade your lordships to understand why it took lines of the draftsmans deathless prose to establish the principle that only a mohammedan or practising jew could operate as a barber in scotland on a sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord peart in congratulating the mover of this motion to receive this bill very warmly for the clear and concise way he has put it before your lordships house <e> <s> i think that was the only point on which i did agree with the noble lord lord peart during the whole of his speech but we will come to that later <e>", "<cs> i do not want to repeat again at this stage of the bill the remarks i made on second reading but i think that the noble lord lord peart must by now have realised that there is a real danger of this useful bills being lost if he persists in his amendments <e> <s> i do not disagree with much of what he has said and i agree also with many noble lords including my noble friend lord manton that there may by now be a time for a reassessment of the work of the levy board <e>

congratulate the noble lord lord plummer on one of the most knowledgeable <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that in view of the number and complexity of the questions put to him on this very important matter there is possibly a job of public relations to be done to explain to the many consumers of water throughout the country exactly what he has explained so lucidly and so carefully to the house this afternoon <e> <s> i ask him that question as a consumer of water in the borough of avon <e>", "<cs> my lords as a previous president of the london tourist board may i ask my noble

situation a little for the genuine benefit of tourism throughout the entire country <e>", "<cs> my lords you may have noticed in the newspapers this morning a report of an interesting event <e> <s> it occurred last night in the great city of bath and it was the re-opening of the restored theatre royal <e> <s> i at once declare an interest because like many people who lived around that area i was persuaded to take part in a little fund-raising and the result was extremely encouraging the money came in i must remind your lordships that there is still a little more to come please from the widows

tourist industry and i say it for the benefit of those who mock tourism who jeer at tourists and who forget the contribution that tourism and the theatre make to our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords back from the surplus of butter to the surplus of legislation i take careful note of what my noble friend the chief whip said and will therefore stick to one point and one point only <e> <s> it is my view that one of the reasons why we have such a complexity and gallimaufry of legislation is our wasteful misuse of parliametary time <e> <s> we invariably end any major and complex bill in an undignified canter <e> <s> i should like to see some arrangement and it should not be beyond the wit of a man or woman to devise it whereby just before the bill passes on to the statute book it is withdrawn from parliament to allow all those concerned the draftsment in particular to have a quiet look for a few days at what was originally a workable bill and has become an unworkable act <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening in this debate without having put down my name to speak <e> <s> i am tempted to do so by the remarks with which the noble lord lord ross opened his <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add a few words of welcome to this useful and humanitarian measure and to thank the minister for the clarity with which as usual he has put a fairly complex matter before your lordships house <e> <s> although the matter involved is simple the bill is complex because no measure affecting matrimonial affairs is anything except complex <e> <s> your lordships will remember that the noble lord lord renton introduced a debate a few weeks ago raving against the gobbledegookery of some draftsmanship <e> <s> i would not go so far as to say that these pages contain much gobbledegookery but they get extremely near it <e> <s> i can only hope that some of the poor people who are going to benefit from this bill will be able to understand it slightly better than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask your lordships to remember the debate that we had when the word ombudsman first came before us <e> <s> everybody complained about it it was an ugly word nobody would know what it meant and

definition of ombudsman is <e> <s> may we therefore decide that whatever we eventually call this new commission however ugly it be it must be something that the public are going to call it and let us remember that ombudsman ugly though it is is what the public now says <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a wide field to cover and time is at a premium so i propose to confine myself to one aspect only and that is the number of illusions about this problem which are hindering our attempt to solve it <e> <s> the noble lord lord jacques and i found very little to disagree with in what he had to say to us

private fight or a public fight but whichever it is i should like to join in <e> <s> i wish to begin by offering my support to the minister for the able way in which he put this important matter

few words now <e> <s> as time is obviously even more valuable than it was when we started this debate what seems to be light years ago i shall confine myself to one point only <e> <s> what can we do to relieve the burden on the charity commissioners <e> <s> we saw this very clearly and it was brought to our attention in the brightman committee on which the noble lord lord allen and i and many others served <e> <s> they have far more work than they can possibly do <e> <s> the committees report which i have here is quite frank that the charity commissioners have far too much work and they do

understand it i should not think the charity commissioners will either <e> <s> i certainly do not <e>", "<cs> my lords as time is beginning to run short i shall confine my remarks to one point and that is a point of caution <e> <s> i heartily agree with everything that was said by the noble lord who moved this motion about our debt to tourism as part of the national economy <e> <s> however i believe that there is a risk of overselling <e> <s> there is a risk of overenthusiastic marketing and there is a risk of making enemies by going too far and exercising too little tact <e> <s> i believe that is called counter-production in modern jargon <e> <s> in plainer english if one over-eggs the omelette one may get egg on ones own face <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add a few words of support for this useful little measure which has been moved by my noble friend lord montgomery in his customarily lucid way <e> <s> i must declare a previous interest in exactly the same way that he did because i preceded him in the office of president of the restaurateurs association of great britain a duty that i carried out to the best of my ability for nearly years <e> <s> i therefore support this bill not only out of loyalty but also because i think it is an extremely good bill especially as i tried to bring forward exactly the same kind of measure about seven years ago but failed

kimball for instigating this useful debate <e> <s> furthermore perhaps i may suggest that when a noble lord as loyal to the governments cause as my noble friend draws attention to problems arising from a report such as this the government would do well to heed that warning <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the enormous sums of money that drug cartels have at their disposal we are talking about many billions of pounds and are using to market their products compared with the relatively small sums available to the customs and police services and in view of the fact that with all the goodwill that is forthcoming there is considerable difficulty in liaison between the various police forces in the united kingdom and between them and customs will the government consider setting up a national drug enforcement agency as the americans have done with much success <e>", "<cs> my lords other noble lords have already mentioned this but i wish to repeat that we should be grateful to the noble lord lord hunter for tabling this debate <e> <s> it is particularly useful to be able to debate this huge subject calmly before the governments forthcoming bill reaches us <e> <s> i intend to

noble and learned lord lord mccluskey when he spoke of the problems about profit in the private sector <e> <s> such ventures i shall not go into them now need not fall into that category <e> <s> they can provide as this does a standard of care not currently available in the health service at a very much cheaper price than the health service can provide <e> <s> i believe that it is a goal worth seeking <e> <s> i hope that we may be able to consider that at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for tabling this debate <e> <s> i

illness or disease <e> <s> theoretically therefore the definition has been moved outside those brackets even before we start to discuss it <e> <s> the definition is important <e>", "<cs> my lords it

local authority a district health authority my authority or yours <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it could be that <e> <s> i hope and believe that my noble friend may be using the word in a wide context to cover voluntary organisations because the biggest part of the problem that we discussed in committee was the very poor relationships between local authorities and the voluntary sector <e> <s> the
