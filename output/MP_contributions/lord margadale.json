["<cs> my lords i rise like others to say a few words in this house about this bill <e> <s> i do so because i am a lover of the countryside and have always <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words before the end of this short debate <e> <s> i should like to support the noble duke the duke of atholl in all that he has said <e> <s> i agree that some woodcock are home-bred birds <e> <s> equally very few birds will be shot in august they will only be shot in bracken people do not go through woods at that time of year <e>", "<cs> i disagree with both my noble friends in that i do not like eating a snipe but i should like to support the noble duke the duke of atholl in that if you are going to curtail the snipe shooting season a hit do it at the end of the season rather than at the beginning <e>", "<cs> i only wish to support the last but one speaker in regard to the goldeneye and the scaup <e> <s> they are birds which from force of habit live in a particular place and sometimes find that those places move <e> <s> from my personal observations in the inner hebrides in most of january the scaup are in fact increasing <e> <s> the goldeneye always have been in fairly short supply and i hope that perhaps the minister will be kind enough to look at this matter further before going too far ahead <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support my noble friend on my left <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl why he thinks there is a decline in the number of jack snipe <e>", "<cs> why my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity of saying a word or two on this bill <e> <s> as i spent most of the morning at the dentist i am going to be rather brief <e> <s> may i first apologise to the noble lord lord houghton for having taken his committee room last night <e> <s> we were talking on the subject of deer <e> <s> it was done quite unwittingly <e> <s> i was told to go to room and i did <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity of taking part very briefly in this debate <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady elliot for putting this motion before the house <e> <s> i must declare an interest in that i am responsible for farming affairs on an island in the outer hebrides <e> <s> i should just like to say a word or two about farming <e> <s> in fact the noble baroness has said very clearly what i was going to say in regard to the position of a great deal of farming in scotland particularly in the west highlands which is considerably indebted to the bank at the present time <e> <s> that is one of the troubles with the recession <e> <s> i am glad that the noble baroness mentioned the subject of lime which is an elementary but important matter <e> <s> i agree with everything that the noble baroness said and would like to support her very warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether thought has been given to the fact that some people think that with the lower roof the acoustics in this chamber are better than with the higher roof heretofore <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the amendment moved by the noble viscount <e> <s> lord ridley <e> <s> in many cases the small museums are a great source of pride to the rgiments and greatly help in recruiting for the territorial army <e> <s> the noble earl lord avon who is to reply knows a great deal about this for he is a distinguished london territorial <e> <s> i hope he will give it a sympathetic hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is getting on and there are still a number of speakers on the list <e> <s> nearly all that i might have said in a very short speech has already been said much more eloquently than i could hope to say it <e> <s> therefore i have just scribbled on a bit of paper one or two salient points which i have come across <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord tanlaw in what he said about the west of scotland agriculture college <e> <s> i agree that it is a first-class set-up which is very helpful to the farming community <e> <s> anything they say should be read digested and considered useful <e> <s> i have not read their report and therefore i cannot comment further <e> <s> i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for initiating this debate <e> <s> it is nice to see two brothers not only smiling at each other but laughing at their own jokes too <e> <s> i have two sons in another place and although they sit on the same benches they sometimes disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords the other point i want to make a point which affects my own part of the world the island of islay in argyllshire concerns geese <e> <s> at the moment geese are rather a sore point because a great number of them eat a great deal of grass particularly the early type and it is impossible to grow any form of winter corn on the island because the geese stay long enough to eat it all before returning to the north <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble marquess lord lansdowne said that he was nervous when he started to speak <e> <s> having listened to three such excllent speeches which i found very interesting indeed i can only say that i am much more nervous than he or anybody else <e> <s> i welcome this opportunity of saying a few words since i enjoy salmon fishing very much <e> <s> i must declare an interest for although i do not own a river or an hotel now my family do so which helps towards salmon <e> <s> i welcome this bill particularly because whatever happens today i hope that it will be the start of real discussion and of the government of the day doing something concrete to help preserve our salmon <e> <s> there is no doubt that the salmon stocks all over the world and certainly in this part of it have decreased very considerably and unless something is done in a few years time neither the rod fishermen nor the netsmen will be able to get many salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lord craigton will forgive me if i do not follow him in his speech at this juncture <e> <s> i do not know the contents of his letter and i do not know enough about maritime matters to comment properly <e> <s> i should like to say that i heartily support and agree with the speeches made by my noble friends lord stanley of alderley lord middleton and lord tryon <e> <s> i should like to comment but i think that it is outside the scope of this bill on some of the points made by the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> i shall refrain from doing so except to say that in regard to the elimination of what i call hedges and what the modern generation now call habitats there are in my part of the world very few and it looks as though that could be so in the part of the world inhabited by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i am old enough to remember the first lord melchett the noble lords great-grandfather i think who did a wonderful job in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to say a brief word in support of the proposals made by her majestys government <e> <s> i should like to thank them and i hope that something concrete will arrive at the end of it <e> <s> i am also grateful for the opportunity of speaking after the noble lord lord tryon who i know is an expert with rod and line <e> <s> i hope that will not mean that too many fish will be removed <e> <s> we all have to remember be we rod fishermen net fishermen freshwater or salt water that salmon can only breed in fresh water usually at the top of our rivers <e> <s> we must not take out too many to prevent them getting there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first humbly to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord biddulph on his maiden speech <e> <s> i remember when i made mine it was a most alarming affair but he did not seem to be the least bit alarmed and i thank him very much for it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say one thing to my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> we had the same trouble in the island of islay <e> <s> there is a receipt which comes in powder form which can be dispersed from a motorboat and all the pike will be dead in about two days <e> <s> if he reminds me i will give him the address <e>", "<cs> i have been bobbing up and down for a while and i promise to be brief <e> <s> i understand that i am in order <e> <s> i support the words of the noble lord lord middleton and the noble earl lord radnor <e> <s> i should like to thank her majestys government for bringing forward a much-needed bill <e> <s> i live within miles of stonehenge <e> <s> i probably know a little more about how important the bill is <e> <s> i have a letter from a good friend who is a distinguished qc and who is unhappy with the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to refer to the speech of my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very late and i want to say only a few words <e> <s> i agree with the first three noble lords who spoke and in particular the speech if i may say so without decrying the others of the noble viscount lord dilhorne potted the situation better than any other <e> <s> the main trouble and i am afraid i must disagree with the noble lord lord montagu in what he said is that the way listing is done upsets people to start off with <e>", "<cs> i should first of all like to congratulate my cousin lord granville <e> <s> i feel quite proud of him <e> <s> we had the same grandfather who and i am sorry to have to say this to the noble viscount lord thurso was a liberal foreign secretary to mr gladstone <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord cranbrook for being responsible for starting this debate and also for his very interesting speech although i must admit that i do not agree with all of it <e> <s> if you were a crofter in islay and i have been connected with islay all my life it would be difficult to believe that everything was quite as happy as it sounds in this chamber <e> <s> on one side is the atlantic ocean and on the other side is your croft <e> <s> you possibly have another job to do as well and life will be quite difficult because of all the restrictions put on by sssis <e> <s> i personally think that there are too many and that there will be a great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to disagree with most people in the house but i very much concur with the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> i have never spoken to her before but i agree with what she said <e> <s> i wonder how many people in the chamber this afternoon have read the next amendment <e> <s> i suspect rather few <e> <s> i feel that if we have a vote in favour of the amendment many local authorities will have lots of different rules which will be muddling and they will get into great confusion before matters go very far <e> <s> the next amendment if noble lords read it lays down much more what is to be done leaving matters fairly fluid at the same time <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble lord on the front bench in answering this amendment will say a word about the next amendment which i think is better <e>"]
