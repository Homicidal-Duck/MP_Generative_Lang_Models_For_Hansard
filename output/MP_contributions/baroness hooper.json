["<cs> my lords this is an occasion which i have anticipated with rather mixed feelings <e> <s> nevertheless it gives me the opportunity to thank your lordships for the very kind and friendly welcome which has been extended from all sides of the house <e> <s> in the several weeks since my introduction to your lordships house i have enjoyed being able to follow the debates and procedures and to appreciate both the expertise of the contributions made and the very amiable manner and style in which your lordships conduct the business of this house <e> <s> i therefore feel very strongly the privilege of being able to participate in these proceedings and i thank the noble baroness lady burton for her kind and encouraging remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank my noble friend the minister for his statement <e> <s> furthermore i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady burton of coventry on her perseverance in ensuring that we had this discussion this afternoon <e> <s> i too as vice-chairman of the european parliaments consumer protection committee was formerly involved in pushing for some action on this proposal which in my view does not necessarily give added protection to the consumer but is certainly intended to simplify the procedures and means by which he can seek redress if he suffers from defective products <e> <s> i therefore welcome this proposal and the decision of the council as a step in the right direction and a definite link in the chain of lord cockfields programme on the internal market <e>", "<cs> my lords in accordance with previous practice both houses of parliament will be informed of the terms of the new voluntary agreements when they have been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ennals for his kind remarks and to say how glad i am that he is able to be here to put the question <e> <s> i am profoundly sorry about the cases which he has quoted but the government believe that the system of voluntary agreements which are worked out in confidence with the tobacco industry are the most effective and flexible methods of controlling this area <e> <s> this is of course in accordance with previous practice by successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords the custom of agreeing these voluntary agreements in privacy and in confidentiality has been as i said carried out by successive governments <e> <s> i feel sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be well aware of the questions which have been raised in this house of the debate which took place in may this year and that your lordships opinions will have been noted in this respect <e> <s> in regard to sponsored events the government are satisfied that the voluntary agreement has worked well <e> <s> it offers effective and appropriate means of control and allows the industry to make a significant contribution to sport <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lords question proves the point <e> <s> his abandonment of smoking was voluntary <e> <s> the government continue to believe that the most effective method of control is by way of voluntary agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is evidence of improvement <e> <s> the latest general household survey figures based on information collected in showed a further fall to per cent <e> <s> in the proportion of adult smokers <e> <s> since when the first voluntary agreement was concluded smoking prevalence among men has declined by almost one-third and among women by about one-fifth <e> <s> i think that the figures speak for themselves in demonstrating what can be achieved by these means <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of this particular programme but i believe that the controls continue to be strengthened all the time and that therefore progress is being made in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that your lordships house is conducting a very special case in this matter <e> <s> as i have said i shall certainly make sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state is well aware of the views of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that both the government and the tobacco industry are well aware of these figures and i feel sure that note is taken of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i cannot give that assurance <e> <s> however the government are and have been happy to receive views from individuals or bodies on issues concerning the agreement <e> <s> the department has meetings with representatives of the bma the health education council and other bodies which are concerned in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is a very important contributory factor to the sad consequences of lung cancer <e> <s> i shall certainly do what i can to make sure that in any surveys or any future consideration of the problem these factors are drawn out <e> <s> if there is any way in which i can help the noble lord subsequently i shall be happy to try to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any postponed plans and on principle we would not expect centrally to monitor progress during the year <e> <s> service developments at health district level are a matter for local management <e> <s> health authorities receive a cash sum each year within which they are expected to fund pay and price changes and service developments <e> <s> inevitably the level of pay and prices affects the resources available for service development <e> <s> but the national health service cannot be isolated from the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords the department has heard from a large number of health authorities about this matter <e> <s> generally the message has been that authorities have been able to accommodate this years increase in paybill costs for nurses and doctors as ministers predicted when the awards were announced and still continue with most of their planned developments <e> <s> it is as a result of the announcement made in the other place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer that we feel confident that the increases which are staged over a two-year period are going to be met by the increases in funding that have been promised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe i referred specifically to wales at all but i may say that so far as wales is concerned the excess cost of this years pay awards after allowing for discretionary growth and national insurance restructuring amounts to only million or per cent <e> <s> of total revenue resources <e> <s> that small excess should not entail any reductions in service provision and should largely be met from efficiency savings <e> <s> so i think the noble lord need have no particular worries so far as wales is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole object of the restructuring was to ensure that at local level responsible decisions would be taken <e> <s> my information is that advice and plans at local level are going equally well and that the local health authorities are finding themselves able to cope with the financial situation as it faces them <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in funding announced last week as i have already mentioned is helping the local health authorities to meet the requirements resulting from the increase in pay awards <e> <s> i would not wish at this moment to confirm precisely the figure quoted by the noble lord but i understand that in making representations the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree in general <e> <s> in fact the most crucial measure of the national health services success is not the amount of money spent but what is achieved with that money in terms of services to patients <e> <s> our hospitals are now able to treat more patients than ever before <e> <s> in hospitals in england alone had more inpatients cases more day cases and million more out-patient attendances than in <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the latter part of that question was slightly outside the terms of the original question and since we are due to have a very wide-ranging debate this afternoon over the whole of the national health service perhaps the noble lords concern will be met in the course of it <e> <s> so far as wales is concerned my information is that the welsh authorities stated earlier in the year that they welcomed the considerable growth in the development of the health services which have been funded since <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has asked local education authorities to appoint officers for this and related tasks <e> <s> the government are also encouraging links through various forms of direct financial support through central initiatives such as the technical and vocational education initiative tvei and the lower attaining pupils programme and through their wholehearted backing for industry year <e> <s> they are also publishing a new directory of link organisations which will be distributed to schools at the start of next year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are a number of links which are being encouraged by the <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of organisations and projects which are receiving support from the government <e> <s> certain of them receive financial support <e> <s> this is obviously a very worthwhile one <e> <s> i am not aware of the specific meeting to which the noble baroness referred but i shall of course draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the service industries and the catering industry in particular are very valuable in this respect <e> <s> i am very happy to hear from my noble friend that there is a specifically close link between this particular industry and schools and i think this must be encouraged in every way <e>", "<cs> my lords universities are aware of and are known to share the governments concern to ensure freedom of speech and the committee of vice-chancellors and principals is expected to issue advice shortly in the form of a code of practice <e> <s> the government are in contact with the university of manchester in particular about the deplorable incident last month involving a minister of the crown <e> <s> the university decided last week to set up a committee to establish the facts fully and to consider disciplinary action <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> to quote from the governments green paper on higher education issued earlier this year the aim being set by the government is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for pointing out this specific case of which i was not fully aware <e> <s> if the facts which he describes are true then i thoroughly deplore the action <e> <s> it is not in line with the governments intention which is to ensure that the facilities and circumstances at educational establishments are such as to ensure full freedom of speech <e> <s> i shall perhaps be in a position to refer his comments about the guildford school of law to a suitable institution for further consideration <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that university students have always been renowned for high spirits but a course of conduct seems to have come into common practice recently of simply not allowing particular speakers to enter an establishment or to be heard <e> <s> to meet the noble lords points of concern i can only say that it is hoped that once issued the code of conduct will provide a variety of procedures designed to ensure the most effective protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have been aware of it before but i am now <e> <s> i thank the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> again my lords i was not aware of that particular case and again i thoroughly deplore the need to take any preventive action by way of disallowing visiting speakers <e> <s> i shall pass the question on to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think we must await the issue of the code of practice before we take any definite stance on what arrangements are likely to be made <e> <s> i agree that it tends very much to be a minority group and sometimes it may well be that these are outsiders as certain incidents have proved <e> <s> but i think it is important that in this matter the government advise that the action and the preventive <e>", "<cs> my lords it must always be difficult to judge <e> <s> that is why again the enforcement practices must be suggested and carried out by the universities themselves to ensure that each case is judged on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to know the motivation of a group which starts such a disturbance <e> <s> i can only repeat that it is hoped that the code of practice will be designed to provide a variety of procedures to cope with the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not open to me to comment on the code of practice before it is announced which is expected to be later this month but it is anticipated that it will include provisions relating to the expulsion and prosecution of and the withholding of grants from students and possibly also from the students union <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that that point will be met <e>", "<cs> my lords a comprehensive review of the departments complement requirements is now under way under normal arrangements <e> <s> the first results will be available about the middle of next year <e> <s> this is the appropriate and agreed means of ensuring that staff provision and workload balance <e> <s> london and other inner city areas face particular problems <e> <s> but complementing arrangements allow a margin to meet the requirements of turnover <e> <s> special difficulties can be and are dealt with by the exercise of judgment in the allocation of posts to individual offices <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has asked a number of questions <e> <s> taking the last one first in respect of the chief adjudication officers report i would not wish to go much further than to say that i have noted it and am aware of it <e> <s> my honourable friend in another place i agree with him has said that he welcomes the report which confirms his view that the social security reviews are badly needed <e> <s> as for what the government have already done in relation to the difficulties over numbers and the endeavour to keep the workforce in line i can mention <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed aware of this series of advertisements that have been placed to this effect <e> <s> we are aware of the particular problems in certain offices and the government have undertaken to review the position <e> <s> they are conducting the normal review as i have said <e> <s> they are seeking through the complement system which is after all a tried and agreed system to meet the particular local requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble baroness that that office is one which has recently experienced considerable difficulties <e> <s> officials are urgently discussing with the property services agency options to provide three or four integrated local offices in central london to take over the functions at present carried out in bloomsbury area office city and west end national insurance offices and in westminster ilo <e> <s> when the necessary funding is available we look forward to our staff being much better accommodated and so able to offer an improved service to the public in the end <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to my noble friend lord mottistone for presenting us with this timely opportunity for sharing views on this important subject <e> <s> these are views which must be taken seriously coming as they do from so many experts and people who dedicate time and effort to the voluntary sector in this important area of mental health and care <e> <s> i am encouraged that time and time again the view is expressed that we are moving in the right direction with community care <e> <s> it is not an easy cheap or convenient option <e> <s> we feel it is simply the best way of offering a group of disadvantaged people the chance of living the best kind of independent life they can <e> <s> of course there are difficulties to obscure the objectives themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord winstanley referred also particularly to the royal college of psychiatrists and the treatment of unprepared discharges <e> <s> we well understand the point but i feel it is worth saying that we are glad that the royal college recognise the difficulties because they themselves accept a crucial role in ensuring that appropriate facilities and care are available for patients before they discharge those patients from hospital <e> <s> this individual case planning is absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> my lords british embassies high commissions and consulates-general were informed of the abolition of the half test by the central office of information during the period st october to st october this year <e> <s> they were asked to make the information available to british expatriate retired women by whatever means they thought best <e> <s> additionally the information was carried in a number of womens magazines and a daily and sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> the information available to women living abroad is exactly the same as that which has been available to women in this country <e> <s> the department has been identifying from its records those people who are eligible to claim <e> <s> in the event that they have changes of address or changes of name this has proved difficult but the publicity campaign has been conducted in this country at the same time as the publicity campaign overseas <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly pass on the noble baronesss concern to my right honourable friend the secretary of state but in fact every effort has been made most importantly through the departments own records but also in every way <e> <s> canada is a country where the pensioners association is particularly active and where writers of newspaper articles and the association itself have done their utmost to disseminate information <e> <s> i do not have reports from the other countries to which the noble baroness refers but i feel sure that the equivalent associations there have been equally active <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is complicated and therefore i must be as careful as <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft social security contributions re-rating order be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords until today there were only two facts about national insurance contributions of which i was at all certain <e> <s> the first was that i had to pay them and second that as in other matters whose complexity is legendary your lordships house could proudly point to members whose expertise is equally legendary <e> <s> i should like to thank those experts who have made a contribution to this debate <e> <s> i shall try to answer some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger left me with three basic questions <e> <s> she raised also a couple of points on the drafting of the actuarys report <e> <s> i can perhaps start by saying that i endeavoured in my opening remarks to paraphrase and to simplify some of the terms that had been used <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in no way complacent on this topic but feel that government policies have been effective in view of the per cent <e> <s> fall in cigarette consumption since and the drop of per cent <e> <s> in total cigarette clearances on a calendar year comparison between and <e>", "<cs> my lords the reductions in cigarette sales are substantial from billion in to less than billion in <e> <s> i believe the noble lord will be aware that in other countries where there is a total ban on advertising and sports promotion the progress is not as rapid as in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in his question the noble lord lord airedale is in fact referring to the report of the commissioners of customs and excise based on a financial year <e> <s> in fact there was an exceptionally high level of clearances prior to the last budget <e> <s> the point made by my noble friend on increases in imported cigarettes does point to the fact that purchases are governed by price variations rather than any other factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that this is somewhat outside the terms of the original question <e> <s> nevertheless i can say that i heartily agree with the noble baroness and that in various parts of the country many measures are being taken to endeavour to combat this problem of people smoking in public places <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree <e> <s> while congratulating the noble lord lord shinwell on overcoming the effects of tobacco smoking i would <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the underlying premise of my noble friends question may i say that i will do a little more research before giving a detailed answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have welcomed the publication of the report from the british medical association and from the health education council known as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that there has been any indication from the government that they are to alter their position on pipe smoking <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i need give no further answer <e> <s> the point has been noted <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted my noble friends point and i hope we shall bear in mind his advice as a consolation when we reach pensionable age <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to know where to draw the line <e> <s> i feel sure that the government will do their best to get their priorities right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the government are particularly concerned about the level of smoking among secondary schoolchildren in particular and young people in general <e> <s> we are aware of the figures that the noble lord has quoted and this is the reason for a media campaign by the government a pilot project at the moment in two television regions which is aimed at discouraging teenagers from smoking <e> <s> a large amount of money is being put toward this and the pilot project which uses television and cinema advertising will be carefully evaluated with a view to testing the potential for a national campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat the answer which has been given to a private notice question in another place on supply routes from south africa to lesotho <e> <s> the answer is as follows we view this matter very seriously indeed <e> <s> we do not believe that the problems between south africa and lesotho can be resolved by coercion <e> <s> we are making known to the south african government our concern that the restrictions on border traffic should be lifted and that both sides should embark on a dialogue to resolve their differences without delay <e>", "<cs> yes my lords priority is being given by her majestys government to the need for dialogue between the parties concerned and every effort is being made to encourage the lifting of restrictions which are preventing supplies from <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord oram asked specifically about aid <e> <s> our present commitment to lesotho is about million a year which includes both capital aid and technical co-operation <e> <s> in addition there is aid and contact from the ec through and under the lom agreement <e> <s> it is not envisaged at this moment that emergency measures need be taken <e> <s> the request for aid from chief jonathan which arrived yesterday and our information on the situation have not led us to consider that there is any need for such measures <e> <s> i can only say that the position will be kept under review <e> <s> if any dire consequences are seen to be emerging and dangers to the local population the government will consider what steps need to be taken in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have this point very much in mind <e> <s> i shall note the points made by my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> as i said the go slow varies and it is hoped that it will be speeded up without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government will note the remarks made by the noble lord lord hatch in full consideration of his knowledge of the area and of the subject <e> <s> i can only say however that the intentions of the government are to use their utmost endeavours to avoid imposing for example any economic or trade boycotts for the well-known reasons which have so often been quoted and that we shall respond as fully as possible in the manner advocated at the commonwealth conference in october and in accordance with the commonwealth accord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this a priority area for the government <e> <s> the health education council recently began a major new initiative directed at all secondary schools <e> <s> the government are funding a million pilot advertising campaign to influence teenagers against the habit and additional measures are under consideration and review <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the latter figure that my noble friend quotes of between million and million being spent by children on smoking is a very disturbing one <e> <s> the government are focusing very much on that area <e> <s> that is why the health education councils special project the family smoking education project represents the major effort <e> <s> the project is aimed especially at to -year-olds and material including a special teachers guide and a leaflet for parents tells about what they can do to deter their children from smoking <e> <s> these are being distributed free to all secondary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords from all accounts the noble lord is himself a great expert in this area and i feel sure that his experience extends for much longer than my own <e>", "<cs> my lords the health education councils various projects contain advice on many methods of giving up the habit of smoking <e> <s> in this question we are directing our attention to preventing children from starting smoking but no doubt herbal remedies might well be considered in part of the literature issued by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is referring to research conducted by dr ledwith of manchester university into this area which suggested that televised sponsored events are regarded by children as advertising <e> <s> both advertising and sports sponsorship are already strictly controlled by means of voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry and <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> in recent years a number of measures have been taken to discourage illegal sales to children including the issue of guidelines to retailers <e> <s> fines for this offence have also been increased and we are considering what further measures might be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords yes this is a difficult area and that is why current initiatives to prevent smoking include the my body project to improve knowledge of the effect of smoking on health and the pace-setters dont smoke campaign which involves sporting and other personalities who are likely to appeal to youth and to set them an example <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that we need not be totally despondent about this matter <e> <s> after all the figures on which we are basing all this detail were provided for the first time on a national basis only in <e> <s> the survey was repeated in and it is on these fairly short-term figures that we are basing our analysis <e> <s> therefore we shall try not to despair <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if we take a break now <e> <s> i suggest that we do not resume our deliberations before ten minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until ten minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that smoking is by far the greatest avoidable cause of illness and premature death an issue of deep concern to the medical profession and to the government alike <e> <s> we welcome the publicity from <e>", "<cs> my lords the report estimates that over people die every single day from a smoking-related cause <e> <s> that is indeed an alarming figure but not misleading <e> <s> i am sure that the noble viscount would agree that it is desirable that these facts are fully publicised so that people know the risks that they may run from smoking and can make informed choices <e> <s> this must be particularly so as far as the discouragement of young people from taking up smoking is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the first part of the noble lords question i would say that certainly the report known as <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords preventive methods of health care are receiving a great deal of consideration <e> <s> certainly the governments policy which is a voluntary policy on smoking is greatly aided by the maximum publicity on the risks involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of so reducing the pensionable age for men would be about million for a full year at benefit rates <e> <s> it is however extremely unlikely as recent french experience shows that all those retiring would be replaced by someone currently receiving unemployment or other benefit so the actual cost of making such a change would be considerably higher <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of this particular consideration but as i have said the actual cost of bringing down the retirement age as suggested would in fact be much higher <e> <s> a more likely estimate of cost is about million at the benefit rate which assumes a two-thirds replacement <e> <s> but it could be about million if no vacancies were filled <e> <s> i think the government would welcome any suggestions that might meet the costs involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer to that is yes <e> <s> in fact on current figures we understand that something like half the male population between the ages of and are currently out of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that a full explanation has been given of the governments intention in this respect <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services put forward in last junes green paper on the reform of social security the idea of a decade of retirement whereby individuals could choose when they wished to retire between the ages of and <e> <s> views were then invited on how the problem of costs might be overcome <e> <s> unfortunately because no such views were sufficiently helpful it was not possible to take this forward in the recent white paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the estimated cost of equalising pension age at for men and women is available <e> <s> it depends on the assumptions one makes about how many job vacancies and jobs created would be filled <e> <s> if one takes the optimistic view that all the vacancies would be filled it has been estimated that there would be a saving to public funds of some million <e> <s> however unfortunately a more realistic estimate is a cost of some million on the assumption that only two-thirds of vacancies would be filled <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble baroness is correct in saying that <e> <s> i referred earlier to the french experience when in the pensionable age was reduced to overall <e> <s> it has been found that because the contributing period was less they are running into real difficulties in meeting the demands and some consideration is being given to putting back the age to or indeed to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government would like to do a great deal in this respect but whichever path we pursue the costs cannot be ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of this point of view and of the facts quoted by the noble lord <e> <s> the government are considering all aspects of this matter and would like to do a great deal but no immediate action is foreseen <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on teachers pay and responsibilities which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness and the noble lord for their comments <e> <s> i am sorry that the statement was not up to their expectations but i must emphasise that my right honourable friend is pleased that we have an agreement which holds out at least some promise of a settlement of the pay dispute which will mean a return to normal working in the schools and constructive negotiations across pay pay structure and duties and conditions of service <e> <s> this is and must be the main thrust of the governments role <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the matter raised by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is that the national union of teachers has suggested that it will go forward with the arrangements if a positive settlement is reached <e> <s> however perhaps i may inform my noble friend if i find that i have misunderstood that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a point that is perfectly well understood by the government <e> <s> on the decisions taken by all the unions last year during the negotiations both in september and october when offers were put forward the other unions have changed their minds and it is much to be hoped that the national association of schoolmasters will also succeed as a result of its balloting processes in changing its mind <e>", "<cs> the department is fully prepared to back up the local authorities for any spending within their budgets <e> <s> the local authorities are well aware of the stringencies <e> <s> they have a number of pressures they have a number of commitments <e> <s> they are the best people to know how to meet all those commitments and that is why the government have stood on the sidelines to some extent but with the assurance that as soon as the governments requirements or the governments objectives are agreed to the additional sums in hand may be released over a four-year period <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness if i omitted to answer a particular point <e> <s> the government have put forward no pay factor for <e> <s> what is offered for that period will be for the employers to decide <e> <s> the employers as i have said know full well the terms on which the government are willing to release extra resources for teachers pay for and later years and they also know full well the background to the governments decision to start this additional investment from the coming financial year <e> <s> i hope that that helps to amplify my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lady cox for introducing a debate which has been wide-ranging fascinating and at times disturbing <e> <s> however both in consideration of the heavy snow falling outside your lordships house and because of the extreme lateness of the hour i cannot hope to respond to all the many important points touched upon which cover so wide a spectrum of the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are deeply concerned about the level of smoking among young people and are taking a number of different actions to counteract it <e>", "<cs> my lords both advertising and sports sponsorship are already controlled by means of voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry both of them are currently under review and in essence these seek to ensure that children are not encouraged to smoke as a result of advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i do <e> <s> i can only comment that in certain countries where there is a total ban on advertising the decline in smoking habits is not proved to be greater than the decline that is taking place in this country in general <e> <s> but in order to counteract the peer pressure peer with a small p which i understand to be the problem with young people among the current health education initiatives being pressed are the my body project which is intended to improve knowledge of the effect of smoking on health and the pacesetters dont smoke campaign involving sporting and other personalities likely to appeal to youth <e> <s> these personalities include daley thompson lenny henry tony knowles and many others and recently the england soccer team joined the campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking into account all such factors in relation to the renegotiation of the voluntary agreements <e> <s> my understanding on the norwegian experience was that the decline was no better than the decline in smoking habits in this country <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> indeed there was a serious programme on television last night on the subject of smoking particularly among young people <e> <s> it was shown clearly that before the war young people smoked as an act of rebellion and young women especially were counselled very strongly to knock the habit <e> <s> it may well be that now too strong an antismoking campaign could be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by expressing the regret of my noble friend lady trumpington that she is unable to reply to this question herself <e> <s> she is in fact attending the national schizophrenia fellowship conference in oxford <e>", "<cs> my lords on a number of occasions including during the recent debate in your lordships house only last december we have stated that consideration is to be given not only to sufferers from schizophrenia but to the people who look after <e>", "<cs> my lords on a number of occasions we have stated that any hospitals which it is proposed to close will not be closed unless the necessary alternative services are available to replace them <e> <s> broadly as regards local health authorities the secretary of state has in mind to provide earmarked support over the the next few years particularly for innovative projects for community care for mentally ill people in a number of districts <e> <s> the results will then be carefully evaluated and publicised for the general benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the government did indeed welcome the series of articles in <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully acknowledge the valuable contribution of the voluntary sector and other organisations in this matter <e> <s> there have recently been remarkable breakthroughs in research and techniques to help sufferers but the department assists voluntary sector organisations by making grants available for this research <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving us a hot-from-the-scene report on the conference taking place in oxford today <e> <s> the subject of legislation has been raised on many occasions and not least as i said before in the debate in your lordships house in december <e> <s> it has been suggested that legislation is required but the government feel that legislation itself could not conceivably solve all problems and they are taking time and care not to rush into further legislation without the most careful thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with the noble lord and i thank him for his comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i can assure the noble lord that one of the grants recently made to the voluntary sector is particularly for research into this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is referring to the appointment of district health authority chairmen which is to date from st <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that it would not be proper for me to comment on individual appointments in view of the statement to be made in another place shortly <e> <s> however in view of press comments and the general concern which has arisen in mr woods case i should say that it is unfair to imply that an individual has been sacked when the statutory term of his appointment has come to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed chairmen of health authorities are appointed for their personal qualities and not to represent any sectional or particu <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord like many of your lordships does not believe everything that he reads in the press <e> <s> in fact in the case of these appointments the secretary of state is not required to consult anyone <e> <s> he did however take account of nominations and views from various sources including those from members of parliament of all parties national and local organisations and various individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble baroness will have to wait until the announcement is made in another place very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> political qualifications do not count in these appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on individual cases but i can say that the views of regional health authority chairmen are clearly important in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords courses in engineering design including courses with a design element are listed in a booklet called <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that as a result of this question my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be more aware of the problem <e> <s> my noble friend has rendered a valuable service in drawing attention to the dearth of suitably qualified people in this field <e> <s> it is vital that industry should co-operate with educational institutions and make clear their needs and this is one of the objectives of industry year <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact the government have already taken several measures to provide substantial additional resources for engineering most recently the million to be spent on the engineering and technology programme <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this amendment contradicts the provision proposed subsequently in clause of the bill which specifies that elected and appointed governors are to have complete freedom of choice in their decision on whom to co-opt to the governing body <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord lord kilmarnock that we are in this case talking about the governors having the power to appoint whereas at the end of clause where the reference is to the appointment of parent governors it is the local education authority that has the power to appoint <e>", "<cs> in spite of the apparent virtues of the amendment extolled by noble lords opposite i hope that i shall have the support of all your lordships and of my noble friend lord renton in particular perhaps when i say that these are matters which are best left to the regulations which the secretary of state will make under subsection of this clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend to say that the regulations i referred to are to be made under subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and to other noble lords for their helpful comments <e> <s> obviously the position is not absolutely clear <e> <s> i will only mention that subsection <e>", "<cs> i am sure we shall do our best to achieve the most desirable solution but i think the main point to be made in relation to these amendments is that any detail will be governed by regulations rather than by primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat what i have just said <e> <s> we have noted the comments and shall consider the matter <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have the assurance from my noble friend that he does not propose to divide the committee on this particular point <e> <s> of course we were fully aware of the comments made by the noble lord lord irving of dartford during the second reading debate and indeed of the report of my noble friend lord renton which has been referred to <e>", "<cs> i understand the comments made by the noble lord lord ritchie in moving this amendment but unfortunately i have to say that i do not think the amendment adds particularly usefully to the existing legal position <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions are held regularly with the united states government on many subjects including latin america <e> <s> there have been no discussions about the possibility of united states combat troops being sent to south america <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to nicaragua in central america <e> <s> we have in fact our own policy which is shared by our european community partners <e> <s> we support a comprehensive and verifiable contadora agreement based on the contadora objectives which include peace stability democracy and development <e> <s> the united states has stated repeatedly that it also supports the contadora process <e> <s> we advocate a political rather than a military solution and the united states is well aware of our views <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware from our discussions with representatives of the united states of the views that the noble and learned lord mentions <e> <s> we are aware also that the house of representatives rejected on th march a proposal for aid to be given <e> <s> an amended proposal was approved by the senate voting on th march and as we understand it there is a likelihood of a new decision from the house of representatives very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said the situation in the area is extremely delicate <e> <s> the united kingdom government are kept fully informed by their embassies and the united states government and any other governments concerned are kept fully aware of the united kingdoms views on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the united kingdom governments attitude is fully to support the objectives of the contadora group <e> <s> that we do in concert with our european community partners <e> <s> the basic underlying principle is that we advocate a political rather than a military solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the best contribution that countries outside the region in question can make is to offer political and practical help for the consolidation of democracy in central america and to support efforts to achieve peace by the contadora group <e> <s> we are working with our european partners to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords both the united states and the european community are well aware of the underlying problems <e> <s> that is why efforts are being made on the economic front <e>", "<cs> my lords while i may not have had my mind on that particular quotation i am sure that president reagan has <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only restate that the united states government are well aware of our position and of our thoughts on this subject and that we support a negotiated settlement of the problems of central america <e>", "<cs> my lords we regret that our many appeals to the ethiopian government to release the detained members of the former ethiopian royal family have been of no avail <e> <s> we have ensured and we shall continue to ensure that our concern is made clear to the ethiopian authorities at every opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble and learned lords question i should say that nine members of the former ethiopian royal family were released from custody under an amnesty in september <e> <s> in fact one of them came to the united kingdom for medical treatment and has been allowed to stay <e> <s> although ministers have made clear our concern on numerous occasions it is our assessment that any decision to release these prisoners is unlikely to be taken by the ethiopians in response to external pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware of those factors none of which unfortunately necessarily carries great weight with the present ethiopian government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the secretary of state raised this subject with the ethiopian foreign minister in march last year and subsequently reiterated our concern to the new ethiopian ambassador on his arrival in london in july last year <e> <s> these of course were formal occasions but there has been no lack of opportunities for informal representations to be made as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already said that we are acting in co-operation with our european community partners in this matter and i feel sure that the government will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already responded to one part of the noble lords question <e> <s> in replying now to the noble lord i can answer specifically that as regards the suggestion of a united nations resolution or representations made through the united nations so far as i am aware no specific steps have been taken but no doubt it is under consideration with the various governments concerned <e> <s> certainly where aid is given to ethiopia in this context particularly through the european community representations are always made in so far as human rights are concerned <e>", "<cs> while speaking against this new clause i should make clear that the government endorse some of the thinking which underlies it <e> <s> it is common ground that schools should approach sex education responsibly and sensitively that teaching should be offered in a spirit which is supportive of family life and that parents should be fully informed about the schools policies in this area of the curriculum <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat that the government do not believe that the door is closed on <e>", "<cs> we of course recognise the problem to which the noble viscount has called our attention and i can understand and sympathise with the intention behind this amendment <e> <s> but i believe that it may have more far-reaching implications than the noble viscount intends <e> <s> i hope by explaining relevant provisions elsewhere to convince the noble viscount that a further statutory requirement to this effect is an unnecessary addition to current arrangements <e>", "<cs> i think i can give that assurance to the noble viscount that these matters will be kept under review <e> <s> the swann report is evidence of the governments involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of supplementary benefit weekly heating additions was approximately million in <e> <s> this includes expenditure on age and health-related heating additions which could not reasonably be redirected to a combination of thermal insulation measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> indeed in energy efficiency year this is something that the government are concentrating upon <e> <s> we have started an energy efficiency campaign which has been promoted on television <e> <s> leaflets have been distributed and they provide advice for all households on how to improve the energy efficiency of their homes <e> <s> in addition government funded voluntary sector insulation projects are expected to double in number from to during <e>", "<cs> my lords during that period the government looked and certainly in future crises of this sort will look at every way possible to make the system more efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords the voluntary sector insulation projects which i mentioned earlier are a good example of different government departments working together to improve the thermal efficiency of low income households <e> <s> there is the community programme and the manpower services commission funded programme in regard to financing the labour start-up costs are financed by the energy efficiency office while materials are financed by the dhss for draught-proofing and the department of the environment for loft insulation <e> <s> i believe that this is a good example of co-operation among government departments supported by the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords while i think that this point is slightly outside the terms of the original question i am most grateful to the noble lord for drawing the attention of the house to the scheme which i feel will be more generally supported in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i completely understood the relevance of the noble lords supplementary question but voluntary sector insulation projects which are being supported by government funding and in particular the wages of labour under the manpower services commission scheme are helping in addition with the unemployment problem <e>", "<cs> my lords current building regulations are set by the department of the environment and they specify a thermal standard for lofts and walls as well as a limitation on the area of external windows <e> <s> while it is relatively easy to bring dwellings with loft spaces up to this standard it is more difficult to bring walls especially solid walls and windows up to the standard set for new houses <e> <s> this is why i spoke of thermal insulation measures in a package as it were to give an indication of what might be achieved on an average property <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we appreciate the value of draught proofing and the work done in this way by the local voluntary projects <e> <s> i think i can do best by quoting comments made by my honourable friend the minister of state during a television programme recently <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> we must all sympathise with the intention behind this amendment which is that all pupils should receive instruction at school from the police in crime prevention and road safety <e> <s> this would not only provide all pupils with valuable knowledge and skills but would actively promote good relations between the police and our young people <e> <s> there can be few who will disagree with that particularly in view of the very grave problems that are recognised in relation to narcotics abuse <e>", "<cs> i think the only undertaking i can give is to draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state the comments that have been made in this committee today <e> <s> i can only say to noble lords who have just spoken that in my view legislation does not necessarily guarantee good practice <e> <s> the governments attitude and reaction to this amendment and indeed to others results from the traditions and well established practices which in the <e>", "<cs> yes i must remind the committee that family and parental responsibility are involved very much in this sphere <e> <s> the object behind the bill is to establish a structure by which parents have appropriate representation on governing bodies and the governing bodies have appropriate powers to control matters such as the one put forward in this amendment with which everybody must have considerable sympathy <e>", "<cs> i regret to inform the noble lord that the inspiration which i sought from my noble friend has not been forthcoming <e> <s> therefore i must reply by saying that part iii of the bill does not seek to be exhaustive on the prescription of functions but rather provides a framework around which good practice can evolve <e> <s> the noble lord himself said if i remember correctly that it is not the mechanism but the practice that he seeks to underline <e> <s> some local education authorities may decide as now to provide through articles of government for appeals procedures against exclusions <e> <s> that would be entirely reasonable and indeed clause anticipates such action <e>", "<cs> the government do not see the need to impose a particular system on all local education authorities <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock argued that appeal procedures could vary from school to school <e> <s> that is a theoretical possibility <e> <s> but if the position is to be set by articles of government and those will be made in a particular local education authority area then that authority can be expected to adopt a uniform approach for all the schools in that area <e>", "<cs> i shall consider most carefully what both noble lords have said <e> <s> it seems to me that the issue is whether or not there should be an appeals procedure <e> <s> the government while agreeing that there should be an appeals procedure concluded that it should not be mandatory <e> <s> bearing in mind the points that have been made i will take it away and consider it carefully <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that the intention of the amendment is to ensure that money may be spent how they wish <e> <s> that is the reason why the word how appears in the original clause <e> <s> therefore there is really very little if anything between us on this and indeed the spirit of the noble lords amendment is already implicit in the clause <e> <s> therefore the clause as it stands places absolutely no limit on the proportion of funds which local education authorities may place in the hands of their governing bodies so it could mean all <e>", "<cs> this clause provides a minimum requirement that is common to other organisations associations and companies the requirement to hold an annual general meeting to carry out certain statutory requirements <e> <s> in this case the annual parents meeting would be needed for the purposes of clause to consider the governors annual report under clause <e> <s> the government are not opposed in principle to the idea that a governing body should hold more than one meeting for parents in a year <e> <s> we feel however that this amendment has the potential to impose perhaps unwittingly too open-ended a commitment on the local education authority <e> <s> as already stated in relation to the previous amendment schedule paragraph provides that expenses deriving from the annual parents meeting are to be reckoned as part of the cost of maintaining the school and thus are borne by the local education authority <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the purpose of this amendment is to give greater public access to the reports commissioned from the head teacher or the governing body <e> <s> i also recognise that the terms of the amendment endeavour to ensure that items of a confidential nature do not have to be made available <e>", "<cs> i understand fully that the concern of the noble baroness in moving this clause and indeed of the noble baroness and other noble lords who have spoken to it is to draw attention to the anomalous position of some clerks to governors at aided schools <e> <s> matters such as those covered by this clause are normally left to individual schools articles of government <e> <s> where these cover the remuneration of the clerk and i should make it clear that we are talking about an honorarium rather than a salary they normally specify that such remuneration shall be determined by the local education authority <e> <s> the usual form of words leave it open to the local education authority to determine the remuneration at nil and this is the current bone of contention <e>", "<cs> i feel sure that the discussion we are having this evening may speed up the process <e> <s> i finish on this point by saying that this is a question which in future could be referred to the secretary of state when articles are to be made or amended and under the provisions of clause his powers of determination would be considerably wider than his current limited powers of intervention under sections and of the act <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly draw the request of the noble baroness to my right honourable friends attention and i feel sure that there need be no problem on this <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to start by agreeing with the noble lord opposite that this is an extremely complex area <e> <s> the purpose of clause as i understand it is to put beyond doubt the legality of the existing inter-authority payments committee system which has been operating successfully for many years <e> <s> it will also allow the secretary of state to use his default powers to bolster that system where appropriate by giving directions based on national average costs <e> <s> this system inevitably contains an element of rough justice but i think it is to be preferred to one based on actual costs because of its administrative simplicity and because it provides a better balance between the interests of the home and the providing authority <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would be to extend the principle of automatic recoupment enshrined in subsection to all types of further education except those financed from the advanced further education pool as the noble lord has explained <e> <s> the government are keen to remove the undesirable restrictions and anomalies in the present voluntary recoupment arrangements for non-advanced further education and in particular to eliminate the difference in the arrangements relating to those pursuing post-complusory schooling and those seeking further education in a college <e> <s> however we do not believe that automatic recoupment is appropriate for all types of further education for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> i can reassure the noble lord by saying that this is a subject which is generally considered to be important and the government will continue to look at it <e> <s> in my original response i explained that we see this as a developing situation <e> <s> that is why we seek the maximum flexibility which we feel the amendments do not necessarily provide <e>", "<cs> there was certainly no intention to be mean about this provision of the bill <e> <s> it was simply intended as a tidying-up operation <e> <s> it is in fact over years since the last central advisory council report was published <e> <s> that is not to say that successive governments have not continued to value the contribution of informed outside opinion on a wide range of policy matters <e> <s> as the noble lord suggested this is now done on a more <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord henderson on choosing this important subject for our debate today <e> <s> disability as such and the treatment of disabled people is of course a topic to which this house has rightly given a considerable amount of attention in recent years <e> <s> however i believe that we have not previously concentrated in our deliberations on the vital topic of the prevention of disability <e> <s> as has been said the reason that we are doing so today is a direct consequence of the valuable initiative by the uk impact foundation in arranging a seminar on the subject last february which had the full support of the department of health and social security <e> <s> like many of your lordships i wish also to pay tribute to the foundation and to the vision and energy of the chairman sir john wilson <e> <s> the seminar was clearly a very useful occasion and the admirably succinct summary of the conclusions which most of us here today have seen represents a valuable conspectus of the very wide range of issues involved in the prevention of disability <e> <s> these are issues which the government have taken and will continue to take very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is to maintain and wherever possible enhance standards of teaching and research at all of britains universities <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science expects to receive very soon advice from the university grants committee about how the funds available for the universities should best be distributed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i followed entirely the noble lords train of thought in putting that question <e> <s> if he was referring to funding then he will be aware that the government take advice from the university grants committee and that the secretary of state has made it plain that any systematic evidence of adverse effects upon universities as a result of funding policy will be taken into account during the annual expenditure review <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the question was founded on recent press reports that have been entirely speculative about possible closures <e> <s> in its strategy document the university grants committee stated that there might be circumstances in which the phasing out of grants to some universities might be the least damaging way of solving the problems facing the university system <e> <s> however i wish to make it absolutely clear that the university grants committee has not made any recommendations to that effect let alone named particular institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords in that area as in others the government seek to spend the money available in the best possible way <e> <s> it is for that reason that we have asked the university grants committee to submit plans for the allocation of grants to universities and to underline priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of entrants to universities is not being reduced <e> <s> since the evidence shows that the number of home students has increased by nearly <e> <s> the proportion of year-olds to year-olds entering higher education has increased by per cent <e> <s> and the number of mature entrants has risen by per cent <e> <s> the governments plans envisage further increases in participation rates over the next decade <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the university grants committee will be offering advice to my right honourable friend in the summer on the current and prospective financial position of the universities and the recommendations of the university grants committee will be taken fully into account in any plans for future spending as part of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only refer the noble lord to my earlier answer about the increasing number of students and emphasise the fact that in areas such as science and engineering the number has also been considerably increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the figures behind the noble lords supplementary question but the university grants committees decisions are based very much on the merits of the research being undertaken in various university departments <e> <s> the government welcome that approach which gives extra support for high quality research work <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> the training of both dental therapists and hygienists is governed by part iii of the new regulations <e> <s> questions of training are for the general dental council which approves and inspects courses and examinations <e> <s> normally the courses are held at approved medical schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is normal practice for noble lords to inform the house and put their names on the speakers list so that we know who intends to speak but there is no reason why the noble lord should not speak <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will take into account as many points of view as possible and certainly the views expressed here in your lordships house in the course of this report stage and the debate at committee stage when deciding what provision to make in the regulations which will in any event be the subject of wide consultation in draft form <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can certainly agree to write to the noble lord as he requested <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand and sympathise with the feeling behind this amendment and with those who have supported it <e> <s> however it is one of a number of amendments that seek to pursue essentially desirable results through what we see as inappropriate means <e> <s> the governments commitment to equal opportunities for all pupils regardless of ethnic background gender or other factors is clear and unequivocal <e> <s> however i am sorry to have to say to the noble lord lord pitt that i doubt very much whether the wording of his amendment is sufficiently precise to be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house although i understand very well the remarks of the noble baroness i wish to point out that many of the initiatives to which i referred are of fairly recent date and certainly stem from the swann committee report <e> <s> we feel that it will need time and patience to achieve the desired results <e>", "<cs> this amendment concerns an issue about which many people have strong and deeply held feelings as has been evidenced by the contributions <e> <s> i believe that many who have supported the amendment are in favour of the intention behind it as indeed are the government <e>", "<cs> my lords before dealing with the proposed amendment i should first make it clear to my noble friend lord mottistone that the provisions in clause are not new <e> <s> they are essentially a re-enactment of section of the act which would otherwise have been left in limbo as a result of the fresh provision made in this bill for the secular curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the assurance that monitoring will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is similar to one moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh during the committee stage <e> <s> when withdrawing it he indicated that he was less than happy with the governments reply which he suggested implied a roundabout way of getting at <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with all that the noble lord has said about the importance of training for school governors in order that they may be as effective as possible <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will be pleased to hear that the government accept the intention of his amendment which is to empower the secretary of state to grant-aid the development and dissemination of governor training materials <e> <s> however we believe that the necessary powers are already in place under existing legislation <e> <s> for example as regards research generally the secretary of state has appropriate powers under section of the act and the grant regulations of made thereunder <e> <s> it was those powers that were used for example to assist the development of the open universitys course for governor training under the act as well as some other related research <e> <s> maybe that goes some way towards meeting the noble lords point about distance learning <e>", "<cs> my lords i must to some extent reiterate what was explained when your lordships considered this matter at committee stage that it would be superfluous to impose a duty on local education authorities to give reasons for their proposals under sections to of the education act <e> <s> recent high court decisions have established that parents have a legitimate expectation that they will be consulted on such proposals and this is enforceable to the same extent as a statutory requirement to consult <e> <s> therefore the position is covered at common law <e> <s> the secretary of state has at all times made clear the importance he attaches to proper consultation where consultation has been inadequate the secretary of state will not approve the proposals <e> <s> there is thus no need for a statutory provision for local education authorities to provide reasons for their proposals they must already do so <e>", "<cs> my lords government policies have increased the number of full-time and sandwich course students studying engineering in higher education from in to in <e> <s> our most recent measure the engineering and technology programme announced in will add about a further student places in engineering and technology on high quality degree courses by the end of the decade <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a demographic factor in all this <e> <s> the government responded to earlier demands from industry and created more places which it may now be difficult to fill <e> <s> that is why the emphasis is switching to schools <e> <s> the government are aiming to increase the syllabus awareness of schools in order to encourage more pupils to follow courses that will lead to further education in engineering and science subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords in higher education only per cent <e> <s> of the engineering students in were women <e> <s> although it is a steadily increasing percentage the figure speaks for itself <e> <s> we feel that action to increase the number of women engineering undergraduates must begin in schools and that perhaps relates back to the previous supplementary question <e> <s> we need to increase the number of girls taking science subjects at a-level and to do that we <e>", "<cs> my lords the government can only do their best to encourage universities to create more places <e> <s> it is up to them how they use the funds provided by government in organising their courses <e> <s> i recognise that there is an increase in longer courses sandwich courses and the like in various universities throughout the country many of which are proving extremely beneficial <e>", "<cs> my lords again i can only repeat what i said in my original reply <e> <s> as far as government policies are concerned there has been an increase and there is an intended increase in the number of students on engineering courses <e> <s> if individual universities choose to alter their courses as a result of that it is up to the institution itself <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend intended to ask what industry itself is doing as i said the government responded to its urgings that more student places be created in engineering but a considerable responsibility rests on industry and commerce to ensure the success of those measures by signalling to young people that careers in engineering can be financially rewarding and stimulating <e> <s> other ways in which industry can help include the <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the initiative being taken by the engineering council <e> <s> in particular with this year being industry year the government are supporting the initiatives of the council and other organisations in a number of ways <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the university grants committee letter to which i assume the noble lord is referring is that in it there is a specific reference to the planned increase in engineering and technical numbers which it is intended should be maintained <e> <s> i have noted the noble lords remarks about the various institutions in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords the engineering industry training boards insight programme sponsors nine or residential courses at universities each summer to give girls studying mathematics and science in schools a chance to find out about engineering as a career <e> <s> so far about girls have attended those courses and per cent <e> <s> of that total have subsequently taken engineering degree courses <e> <s> i believe that is a measure which is proving valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only refer back once again to my original answer which explained the increase in courses and the engineering and technology programme announced last year which will add another student places in engineering and technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am happy that the noble viscount was able to welcome this amendment as were other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> we must hope that it has the maximum beneficial effect <e> <s> the government and others concerned with the education process will no doubt take into account the remarks made by the noble viscount and others both now and at other <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted the remarks of the noble lord and realised that his present amendment differs as he explained from his previous draft <e> <s> nevertheless i must repeat that the government have no blueprint to impose and want the framework and nature of an appraisal scheme to evolve discussion among the parties concerned and from field trials <e> <s> the government have been trying to get these trials going since the summer of <e> <s> the government have their own thoughts on the outline of any scheme that may come about <e> <s> these were set out by my right honourable friend the then secretary of state for education in his speech to the industrial society on th april <e> <s> these views were being put forward in the acas-assisted talks which following the pay settlement began in march of this year under the guidance of a three-man independent panel <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the noble lords concern and i think that we are all concerned with the role and future of small schools in this country <e> <s> the current school premises regulations with which this amendment is concerned were introduced in following extensive consultations with local authority and teachers associations and other interested bodies <e> <s> the regulations were based on extensive research into the requirements for school premises related to curricula needs and they therefore reflect the broad agreement that was reached on what those requirements should be <e> <s> the proposed amendment would abolish the provision

the noble lord lord pitt for the lucid way he has introduced this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord has so clearly highlighted the bills purpose i too can be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret the fact that neither the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey nor the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee felt able to congratulate the government on the success of the scheme as it is plainly achieving its objective by opening up the best independent schools to children who almost certainly would not otherwise have been able to look at them as an option <e> <s> i feel that can only be to the advantage of those children and the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the scheme opens up the option to all it must include the best <e> <s> i shall endeavour to respond to the detailed questions asked by the two noble lords <e> <s> the increase is in line with the increase in average earnings as the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee suggested <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh suggested that the regulations were expanding the scheme <e> <s> i am not sure how he figures that as there are currently no resources available for any expansion of the scheme <e> <s> if additional resources were available more assisted places would obviously be a happy option but there would also be many competing claims <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord means but i cannot give him the exact figure now <e> <s> i hope to be able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am happy to respond to the speech of my noble friend lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i should like to congratulate her on a most clear and interesting introduction of the purpose of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the british and spanish governments are discussing their differences over gibraltar in the friendly and co-operative spirit that befits two european allies and partners <e> <s> those discussions are taking place against the background of the british governments commitment to honour the wishes of the gibraltarians <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully aware of the changes and transformations that have occurred in spain over the past few years and not least of the importance of spains entry into the european community in that context <e> <s> the important point in this respect is that the process of negotiation has begun and that the climate has been improved <e> <s> as king juan carlos himself said here in this parliament there remains a long way to go <e> <s> it is very important to us that discussions on sovereignty at all times take place <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully aware of the wishes of the people of gibraltar <e> <s> we fully intend to respect those wishes and i believe that the spanish government are fully aware of that commitment on our part <e>", "<cs> my lords the chief minister of gibraltar has always been fully consulted about and involved in negotiations <e> <s> he himself welcomed the references made by the king of spain during his speech to this parliament to the progress that was being made <e> <s> at present i am not in a position to inform the noble lord of any new impetus since th may <e> <s> i can only say that with the british presidency of the european community coming up the incidence of meetings and contact between spanish ministers and the british government will if anything increase <e> <s> within that context i have no doubt that more progress will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords any attempt to make a comparison between gibraltar and any other particular part of the world can be difficult and dangerous <e> <s> i can only reaffirm to the noble lord that her majestys government have guaranteed to the people of gibraltar that their wishes will be taken into consideration in any negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords since the full opening of the frontier in february of last year there has been increased contact and co-operation between the spanish people and the people of gibraltar <e> <s> i believe that such contact can only be good and of benefit to the ultimate outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me now to pre-empt the negotiations that are currently in progress <e> <s> it may be that spain would make such an offer and we would consider it at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree wholeheartedly with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have already said enough to convince the noble lord that that will be so <e> <s> we are all very concerned about the wellbeing of the people of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords the british people have a reputation for honouring their agreements in the international context and my use of those words will be applied in that particular context also <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful debate in spite of the hour <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lords lord mcintosh of haringey and lord ritchie of dundee for the general if perhaps somewhat reserved welcome that they have given to these new regulations <e> <s> perhaps i may first refer to the objective of education support grants which is to facilitate the redeployment of a modest amount of expenditure into areas which by common consent are of national importance <e> <s> i think perhaps that this takes in the comments of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords we are deeply concerned about the human rights situation in iran including the persecution of minorities such as bahais <e> <s> the united kingdom co-sponsored the draft resolution that was adopted by the united nations general assembly in december calling for an end to violations of human rights in iran

rights violations in iran and we shall certainly consider doing so again should the circumstances warrant it <e>", "<cs> my lords i note with interest the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords that matter is somewhat without the terms of the original question and i am not able to give the noble lord a reply but i will look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only aware that the investigation is under way i cannot report back on it <e> <s> with regard to recent press reports concerning renewed persecution our own representatives in tehran have not been able to confirm them <e> <s> it is for

pursue and will certainly take into consideration the report of the united nations representative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not totally familiar with the procedures in such a case but i feel sure that if a question were to be put down by the noble lord then we should be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only reply that there was considerable support for the draft resolution that was co-sponsored by the united kingdom in the united nations in december <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that we will continue to express our concern about those violations at every opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have figures for the number of governments who hold this view but it is clear that there was widespread understanding of the united states action <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is widespread condemnation of terrorism and agreement that it needs to be combated <e> <s> reactions have varied but as i have said they have demonstrated considerable understanding of why we supported the action taken by the united states against libyan state-directed terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords remarks about this very positive aspect of the action taken by the united states in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that not all countries nor indeed all individuals agree and that there are differences of opinion and interpretation <e> <s> however it remains our view that the action was in accordance with the inherent right of self-defence that is recognised under article of the united nations charter <e>", "<cs> my lords together with our european community partners we have taken a number of steps to combat the situation <e> <s> i believe that the cutting of cash may well be involved and

the noble lord <e> <s> however i may be able to give him some comfort <e> <s> in fact there has been a development and i understand that there was renewed discussion on the funding of birkbeck when the university grants committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the government are very well aware of the unique contribution that is made by birkbeck <e> <s> in fact the university grants committee has not issued instructions or advice about the funding of birkbeck college <e> <s> it has drawn the attention of london university to the weighting that it has applied nationally for the funding of part-time students but that is only one of the factors which the university court will need to consider when determining birkbecks grant <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the university grants committee and not the government which has decided on the weighting to be applied nationally for the funding of part-time students and indeed other students <e> <s> it may help the noble baroness to know that the recurrent grant to the university of london is over million a year and it is for the university itself to decide how to fund its constituent bodies within that substantial total <e>", "<cs> my lords the ugc has adopted a standard weighting of for part-time students at all universities and has made that explicit for the first time <e> <s> the funding implied is less than some universities have previously allocated for part-time students but more than others have allocated <e> <s> individual universities are free to continue allocating their resources internally as they judge best <e> <s> i wish to repeat that it is not for the government but for the ugc and the universities themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that all the remarks made this morning will be carefully considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> but i must repeat that the ugc makes a block grant to london university and it is for the university court to decide how that is allocated <e>", "<cs> my lords i note all the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i remind him that the position of birkbeck college is under review or reconsideration but we believe that the general approach of the ugc as a result of its review and detailed survey has been beneficial <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion that birkbecks grant has been cut by per cent <e> <s> is speculation <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> so far as the government are aware its grant for has not yet been determined <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the house that since it has not been finally

that it may determine as a result of the recent meeting and any new evidence at which it may be looking <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be that the ugc pointed out that the national figure for part-time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ensure that that distinction is fully considered in the right places <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i regret that at this moment i cannot give the noble lord an answer but i shall let him know <e> <s> i believe that they may come out at the end of the year <e>", "<cs> this may

protection of the young is a prime aim of the latest voluntary agreement on cigarette advertising which came into effect on st april <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there are a number of innovations <e> <s> in the first place the industry itself under this agreement is to spend million a year over the course of the agreement in other words spending will amount to about million in a drive to encourage support for the law <e> <s> this campaign is intended to be far more comprehensive in its coverage than any previous effort of this type and involves media advertising and teams of merchandisers as well as direct mailing of material for display in shops <e> <s> in addition there is a ban on cigarette advertising on cinema screens a ban on advertising in magazines widely read by young women and other restraints on advertising such as posters near schools and at road shows and air shows <e>", "<cs> my lords targeting on the young in terms of this voluntary agreement was aimed at the school children population where there is some evidence that there may be a trend to more smoking <e> <s> the general campaign of the government against encouraging smoking is targeted at other areas which include pregnant mothers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government take note of all surveys and reports on this very important topic <e> <s> since this particular question is directed at campaigns concerning the young i think it is encouraging to note that at least in the post-school population of to year-olds there has been a steady decline in smoking among teenagers in that particular age group <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the private members bill currently before the house that is concerned with the protection of children certainly the government are supporting that bill which is intended to prevent sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products to young people <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord has read the latest voluntary agreement against advertising which is available in the library <e> <s> we believe that we have achieved more by our voluntary agreements than some countries that have legislated against cigarette advertising and the statistics bear out that evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that influence from whatever direction is much to be welcomed <e> <s> the difficulty in this area is that cigarette advertising is often cited as a direct cause of youngsters taking up smoking but in fact there is little direct evidence to support that <e> <s> the causes seem to be much more complex peer group pressure and adolescent experimentation among them <e> <s> obviously the governments campaign and the health education councils campaign which is supported by the government are directed at influencing teachers parents and others who can influence young people not to start smoking <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the total figures which i have somewhere show a decline in smoking overall <e> <s> the concern of the government and the concern of the original question was to prevent any increase among the young where there was some cause for concern that there might be an increasing trend <e> <s> but overall there is concrete evidence that the voluntary agreements and the campaigns against smoking have produced positive results <e>", "<cs> my lords the habit of snuff-dipping or skoal bandits is the subject of a new voluntary agreement which requires the use of health warnings and further marketing restrictions <e> <s> this voluntary agreement is still under discussion but it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too well aware of the anti-smoking lobby in this country and i am very pleased that the noble lord has taken the place of the late lord shinwell who was constantly making remarks of this kind <e> <s> the government do not in any way intend to ban smoking <e> <s> what they are trying to do under the present arrangements is to discourage people from starting to smoke <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is no <e> <s> but shall try to help my noble friend by making further inquiries and letting him know about this <e>", "<cs> my lords the anti-heroin campaign is being independently evaluated by two companies one using a quantitative survey of young people and the other interviewing small groups in depth <e> <s> the evaluation has indicated that the campaign has increased young peoples resistance to heroin <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the campaign is continuing on the basis that over the two-year period that it has been in existence the evaluation provides clear evidence that the percentage of young people who said that they would reject an offer of heroin increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> during the first year of the campaign <e> <s> there is also an increased awareness of the consequences of heroin misuse <e> <s> therefore the campaign will certainly continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the campaign is after all designed to prevent the need for services including the rehabilitation services and to avoid the prison consequences of drugs <e> <s> as i have said the campaign is only in the first two years of its existence and the results so far have proved beneficial <e> <s> but that does not mean to say that the government will stop there <e> <s> other means are being used to help fight the campaign against drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of this aspect of the problem <e> <s> they have taken steps and are continuing to do so to prevent the source of the drugs from continuing to increase <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lords first question yes the reason for this campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that goes slightly beyond the bounds of the original question <e> <s> nevertheless the government are using every means at their disposal to pursue the campaign both nationally and internationally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to break our proceedings <e> <s> in moving that the house resumes may i suggest that we do not reconvene the committee stage before oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i should point out that if the amendment were passed as it stands we should be left with the worst of all worlds <e> <s> in order for the dhss to establish whether there was title to statutory maternity pay and at what rate it would be necessary to contact <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help the noble baroness by saying that the requirement for smp for a woman who works fewer than hours a week with the same employer is extended from two to five years and follows existing rules for maternity pay <e> <s> it applies also to other employment rights conferred by the employment protection act <e> <s> where the employee works very few hours in the week it has always been considered right that a longer qualifying period be required before she acquires the employment rights enforceable on employers for full-time employees <e> <s> it provides greater freedom and flexibility for employers in recruiting part-time staff who often work on a less rigid basis than full-time employees <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter has not yet been referred to the secretary of state but we are aware that a recommendation to close the planning school at the essex institute of higher education has been made to the national advisory body for public sector higher education by the transbinary town and country planning group <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the schools high reputation in the area of rural planning <e> <s> in fact there is a special government-sponsored study of rural deprivation <e> <s> therefore we will not lose sight of that fact in future deliberations <e> <s> we are well aware of the geographical location of the school and will bear that in mind also in future deliber-ations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a number of questions and i shall deal with some of them <e> <s> the transbinary working group was set up in response to discussion and consideration of the need to have proper manpower forecasts in certain specialised fields <e> <s> i remind your lordships that for the three institutions recommended for closure an alternative was offered in that instead of a four-year planning course in this case for the essex institute they were offered the alternative of instituting a three-year general environmental degree course <e> <s> the noble lords allegations are not therefore entirely well-founded <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case it was very wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am well aware of that and indeed my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science will be taking it into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords that was obviously one of the considerations that the transbinary working group took into account and it will certainly be in the mind of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft social security benefits up-rating order <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a short but interesting debate <e> <s> i am sorry that it has been necessary to limit the discussion of these important instruments and that they have arrived so late in the timetable but noble lords will appreciate the difficulties that the business managers have been experiencing of late <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that the quality if not the quantity of the debate has shown that your lordships scrutiny of the instruments is in no way affected by the timing <e>", "<cs> my lords we can i believe assure the noble lord that the governments commitment is not to see any decrease or suffering in real terms in respect of child benefit <e> <s> i can perhaps refer the noble lord to the statement made by my noble friend lady trumpington in the course of the debate last night <e> <s> no doubt this point will be discussed at further stages of the social security bill <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt it could have been more or indeed less <e> <s> i shall have to do a little more research before i can give an actuarial definition as i do not claim in any way to have the knowledge of

eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until ten minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume the answer is that payments on the transfer back to serps would go into serps and would in fact boost the personal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords such as may be prescribed from time to time possibly by regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very technical and complex area <e> <s> indeed upon reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must say that i sympathise with the noble baroness over the complexity of this and many clauses of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless the aim of this amendment is to achieve consistency in having th april stated in all the subsections <e> <s> in fact th april is the start of the tax year <e> <s> that is the reason for having th april as the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady trumpington i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if the noble baroness is referring to reimbursement of benefit costs there should be only an per cent <e> <s> reimbursement of payment <e> <s> the remaining per cent <e> <s> could be supported through direct grant again

is that the bill will be amended to permit this but as i have said it is a question of further consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house may i say that i think that the noble baroness has not taken into account the effect of the rate support system <e> <s> but i should reiterate that the government have never been seeking to make savings from the proposed changes to the subsidy arrangements but to provide support for authorities costs in a way which gives more incentive to cost control and efficiency <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness is arguing along the wrong lines <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good discussion on this today although the issue has already been debated albeit late at night and i can really only help the house by restating the governments position <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of state has said that we have a lot of sympathy with the argument that adjudication arrangements for housing benefit should be brought into line with those for other social security benefits <e> <s> but this is not only a very important issue it is also a very complicated one involving difficult questions concerning the relationship between local authorities their staff acting as adjudication officers appeal tribunals and so on <e> <s> major administrative changes may also be involved <e> <s> and all this it has to be said again against the background that we have no clear evidence that the present review arrangements are not generally working in practice <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord lord stallard has said this afternoon about thousands of mistakes little or no criticism has been received from individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further consideration on report be now adjourned i suggest that we do not resume proceedings on the social security bill before half-past eight <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn <e>", "<cs> my lords in the year ended december an average of million cigarettes a month were imported into the uk from countries within the european community <e> <s> a small number of cigarettes were also imported from western european countries which are not members of the ec <e> <s> the government are satisfied that the existing procedures enable all brands which achieve a significant level of sales to be tested for their tar yield <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently testing brands representing per cent <e> <s> of cigarettes imported <e> <s> there has been a sharp increase in the number of imported brands available in this country in recent years <e> <s> it would not be practical or cost-effective to test every brand that comes on to the market but the government try to ensure that brands that have built up a considerable volume of permanent sales are tested <e> <s> the manning is therefore considered currently adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a serious matter but i believe that at the end of my last reply i said that we considered the manning to be adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed but in fact all cigarettes produced for the united kingdom market whether manufactured in the united kingdom or imported are subject to the same tests <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the last question first to my knowledge there is no evidence that the imported brands have on average a higher tar content <e> <s> the government are doing everything they can on the same basis as with home-manufactured products to carry out testing procedures to ensure that that continues to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that there is a european system <e> <s> certainly so far as the united kingdom is concerned we deal with the matter through voluntary agreements and under those agreements a substantial lowering of the average tar yield of cigarettes has been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords we are monitoring everything <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that we are currently testing brands which represent per cent <e> <s> of cigarettes imported <e> <s> that is not necessarily per cent <e> <s> of all brands but as i said previously all cigarettes produced for the united kingdom market are required to carry the tar group on the pack <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that we are all agreed that this is an uncontroversial bill <e> <s> although its provisions are complex they are indeed necessary <e> <s> i should also like to join with the two noble lords opposite in adding my comments about and acknowl-edging the valuable work done by both bodies concerned in the grants in their respective fields the fellowship in the maintenance and promotion of excellence in the field of engineering and the further education unit in the promotion and development of efficient further education provision <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for a prescription to correct refractive errors however small is a matter of clinical judgment by the optician or doctor who undertakes the sight test <e> <s> any complaint that may arise should be referred to the local family practitioner committee for investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of a recently published report that concluded that over-prescribing of spectacles to school children was very common <e> <s> however i understand that there are conflicting professional views on the criteria used in coming to that conclusion and that the author of the report herself accepts that the methods employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a little difficult to agree with that <e> <s> since the question asked about legal safeguards let me say that in addition to considering complaints family practitioner committees have powers to investigate any cases <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original reply there are conflicting professional views on the study <e> <s> it may be of consolation and interest to noble lords to know that the british college of ophthalmic opticians is funding a study into the identification and treatment of clinically important refractive errors in primary school children <e>", "<cs> my lords that is always taken into account <e> <s> but there is other evidence and indeed the report itself suggests that about one-third of the children who have spectacles came for their medical examination without them <e>", "<cs> this amendment goes to the heart of clause <e> <s> it would draw the teeth of the provisions of clause on repair charges <e> <s> as my noble friend has already explained in relation to improvements the main purpose of clause is to protect tenants who exercise the right to buy their flats against having to pay unexpectedly high service charges for repairs <e> <s> we propose that they should be given estimates before sale of the contributions that they would be required to make under the lease to the cost of repairs carried out in broadly speaking the first five years <e> <s> we propose that the landlord should then be bound by those estimates apart from an allowance for inflation <e>", "<cs> there is i think some basic misunderstanding here <e> <s> this clause relates solely to flats <e> <s> the noble lord was referring also to houses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred also to improvements <e> <s> in fact the changes that he seeks relating to improvements have already fallen as a result of our having passed previous amendments <e> <s> i repeat that this is a situation where there is not an easy answer <e> <s> we believe that the landlord is in a better position than the tenant to do this <e> <s> after all there is only a period of five years following purchase where this applies <e>", "<cs> clause gives the secretary of state power to make regulations concerning loans in respect of repair charges payable by leaseholders of flats bought under the right to buy or by agreement <e> <s> in the case of flats bought under the right to buy the regulations may confer on the leaseholder the right to a loan in prescribed circumstances in respect of repair <e>", "<cs> the right arising under clause is for the secretary of state to be empowered to make regulations concerning the loans <e> <s> the sort of detail that my noble friend has raised will be dealt with in the proposed regulations which will be a matter of the widest possible consultation

housing corporation <e> <s> so far as the related point that the noble baroness has made is concerned the detail of this clause is to be laid in regulations and i would wish to look at it further before giving a more detailed response <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and to the noble baroness opposite and i undertake to write to both on these points <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that the proposed new power to make loans has not in itself provoked controversy <e> <s> the proposed right to a loan has however been criticised <e> <s> i can only say that experience will i hope

<s> we have also been working with the housing corporation to develop housing association rented housing schemes funded through a combination of private finance and housing association grant <e> <s> we are confident that some schemes of this kind will start in the next financial year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the building societies act will allow building societies to provide rented housing directly or through subsidiaries <e> <s> societies are now considering what new powers they will use and already societies are using existing powers to make index-linked loans to housing associations for rented housing let under the assured tenancy scheme <e> <s> an example of that is the project under way at milton keynes <e> <s> certainly the government are well aware of the advantages in terms of job mobility that those new provisions will allow <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> in fact it is very early days because the powers under both the building societies act and the housing and planning bill which we hope will shortly become an act will not be coming into effect

referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is little difficulty in saying that the government will certainly bear in mind the rights of existing tenants in the private sector <e> <s> the government

the noble lord lord stoddart after sitting so quietly and patiently through the earlier debate feels it necessary to indulge in scaremongering to the extent of saying that if the european parliament

that he was scaremongering in what he was saying in relation to the amendment <e> <s> i was referring to his use of the expression filching power from somebody else which suggests to me at any rate a rather furtive way of taking power and which in view of the discussion today cannot be held against us <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendments which are now before us introduced by the noble lord

accommodation <e> <s> the government whole-heartedly share that aim <e> <s> as my honourable friend the minister for housing said at bournemouth on tuesday <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that the proposed amendment would apply only to secure tenants associations in other words to public sector tenants <e> <s> in placing a duty on local authorities to provide financial assistance for tenants

help and as the committee will be well aware local authorities do not have a bottomless purse <e>", "<cs> i understand that my noble friend has pursued this point since it was brought to the attention of the house during the closing stages of the debates on the housing and building control act to which he has referred <e> <s> since that debate the land tribunal in a decision that my noble friend has already explained and which was subsequently upheld in the court of appeal showed that there was indeed a problem and that it could have significant implications for ground landlords <e>", "<cs>

undertake <e> <s> with this amendment however the developer could proceed secure in the knowledge that he would have a reasonable period in which to complete a scheme <e> <s> the period could be adjusted for different projects so that the time allowed was commensurate with the scale and circumstances of the development scheme <e> <s> i do not believe this would mean that a ditch having been dug it would necessarily be left in that state for several years <e> <s> at the same time the power to serve a completion notice which must be approved by the secretary of state will give the local

examples <e> <s> if for example we kept to current official usage for the next european elections in we should continue to confuse the voter by referring to the parliament in all official electoral documents as the european assembly while all the manifestos and electoral literature would refer to it as the european parliament <e> <s> that would be the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not collect such information nor would it be appropriate to do so <e> <s> however we believe that religious education and collective worship make a special

have been made aware of the situation in brent <e> <s> the syllabus was drawn up and agreed by a properly constituted conference in which members of the church of england other christian denominations

seeks to encourage knowledge and understanding and respect for the beliefs of others as well as an awareness of the importance of the commitment to personal faith <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that this question raises certain theological points as well as legal points <e> <s> in terms of the agreed syllabus specifically in relation to the brent situation the normal procedures were complied with and in addition to the seven members of the church of england committee the conference included eight representatives of other christian denominations representatives of other world religions and one humanist <e> <s> since the responsibility lies with the local authority it is in that area that we must look to repair any damage that might be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the concern and

introduction of a loan element in student support <e> <s> however the important factor of the proposals now under consideration is that they include greater proposals for flexibility for individual

disturbed by any allegations of interference in academic freedom or in freedom of speech <e> <s> we are committed to supporting freedom of speech whether for invited speakers or the academic staff who are going about their proper business <e> <s> however i understand that mr selbourne has instructed his solicitors to undertake legal proceedings against <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course aware of the public comment that has been made <e> <s> we recognise that while the college clearly has strong links with the trade union movement its aim is to provide courses for liberal adult education which are open to all applicants and primarily for people from economically and socially disadvantaged areas <e> <s> that is why the government have supported the college <e>", "<cs> my lords successive governments have recognised that the provision of long-term residential education for adults by such colleges as ruskin college is a valid and valuable contribution to the range of educational opportunities available for adults in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the meeting with my honourable friend the under-secretary of state on monday constituted a full and frank discussion but i am not at present able to inform the house of the details <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the situation is rather difficult particularly as we understand that legal proceedings might be about to commence <e> <s> perhaps the less said at this stage which might prejudice the outcome of those proceedings the better <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord caithness i beg to move that this debate be now adjourned until tuesday next <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments view that the needs of dyslexic children be considered within the broader framework of children with special educational needs and so the government have no plans to carry out the research referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the problem and are concerned about it <e> <s> they have already funded research in the general field of specific learning requirements for example the warnock report published in may identified a number of areas where further research was considered necessary <e> <s> the department of education and science subsequently funded a programme of four research projects <e> <s> details of the findings were published by the department following a seminar on those projects <e> <s> the government are aware are concerned and are following through the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the existence of dyslexia <e> <s> a number of committees have advised successive secretaries of state for education and science on the subject <e> <s> they include the tizard committee and as i said the warnock committee <e> <s> in the light of their findings the government take the view there are children of at least average ability who have severe or long-term <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the increase to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> under the education act local education authorities and school governors are required to identify children who have or who may have special educational needs including those with special learning difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter with many others is obviously kept under review <e> <s> the difficulties of teacher diagnosis are understood <e> <s> parents also have a duty <e> <s> that is why under section of the education act a parent who feels that his or her child is in difficulty has the right to ask the local education authority to carry out an assessment of the childs needs <e> <s> the local education authority must comply with that request unless it finds that it is in any way unreasonable <e> <s> it is clearly a case where there must be co-ordination between parents governors and teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are obviously in contact with the specialised organisations on this specific subject particularly voluntary organisations such as the british dyslexia association which is the umbrella organisation for all the local associations working in this field <e> <s> so within the general framework of special educational needs <e>", "<cs> my lords we remain committed to supporting the efforts of the un fund for drug abuse control and those of all producing countries in eliminating the illicit production of heroin and cocaine <e> <s> in pakistan we have pledged million to long-term crop substitution projects since and have provided law enforcement assistance to the government in a number of specified areas <e> <s> in south <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> the united kingdom played an important role in the discussions which led to agreement on the elements to be included in the new convention in particular in discussions in february in vienna <e> <s> it continues to contribute to drafting and to negotiations <e> <s> we are currently working to see an early conclusion to the negotiation of the convention and we intend to resume at next years session of the united nations commission on narcotic drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the last question first <e> <s> in this context i believe that i am supposed to answer only one question at a time <e> <s> there are united kingdom drugs liaison officers stationed in south america the caribbean and in other parts of the world <e> <s> the united kingdom government have agreed to provide the governments of south america with such other help as they are able to provide <e> <s> in terms of security and personal risk to the individuals involved in this programme it is impossible for me to give details on numbers and placements of the officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a considerable amount of information about the programme in pakistan and it is difficult to extract the parts that are particularly relevant to the noble lords question <e> <s> perhaps i may write in detail to the noble lord but suffice it to say that action is being taken and progress is being made along the lines of the report <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in fact following the visit of my right honourable friend the minister of state at the home office in september this year the projects in south america have taken a quite specific form <e> <s> in bolivia ecuador and colombia the projects in which united kingdom investment is involved are receiving close co-operation from the countries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords in trying to answer the noble lords supplementary question within the terms of the original question i should emphasise that support for international action to curb illicit drug production is a key element in the governments strategy for reducing the supply of drugs <e> <s> we take every suitable opportunity to raise the subject bilaterally and in multilateral fora <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this debate be now adjourned until tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady young i beg to introduce a bill to establish an incorporated board of trustees of the trusts contained in the trust instrument set out in the schedule to the chevening estate act to confer functions on and to transfer property rights and liabilities to the board to amend the trust instrument and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the present requirements for energy efficiency in dwellings are being reviewed <e> <s> our aim is to combine a higher standard with greater flexibility in the ways in which the requirements can be met <e> <s> we hope to publish proposals next month in a consultation document <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the consultation document will contain proposals for the insulation of ground floors of dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it these regulations will affect new buildings only <e> <s> the additional costs of construction of a range of measures to be discussed in the consultation document is estimated to be between and per house <e> <s> of this to relates to floor insulation alone <e> <s> this is a consultation document <e> <s> what will eventually come out of it remains to be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of the consultation document is to bring in greater flexibility which will introduce a higher overall standard so that builders can choose from a range of measures that will satisfy the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords only a couple of weeks ago in the debate on this topic of heating particularly for the elderly i gave an undertaking to the house that the government were keeping this matter under review and that they recognise that this is a matter of urgency especially when considering the winter months <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that the teacher force is the major single determinant of the quality of education and they are committed to policies for enhancing the professional effectiveness of all teachers <e> <s> teaching quality is <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help the noble lord to know that the hmi expenditure report for stated that the quality of pupils work was being adversely affected by the quality of teaching in three-tenths of the lessons seen <e> <s> it further identified a mismatch of qualifications poor identification of pupil needs and unsuitability of teaching styles as being among the key determinants of inadequate teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to confirm the reports mentioned in the question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> however the government in favouring a pay structure which rewards good teachers and those with extra responsibilities with significant promotion and significant pay differentials are aiming to attract teachers into areas where there is perhaps a scarcity <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking measures to improve teaching quality as was stated in the white papers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are reviewing the whole position of teachers pay as your lordships will be well aware <e> <s> the aim is to provide incentives to encourage teachers in areas where there are scarcer resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to suggest that the appraisal system is to be used to weed out inadequate teachers is a very negative way of describing a positive process <e> <s> systematic appraisal will ensure that problems are identified early on and that help can be provided <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not prepared to confirm that statement <e> <s> the governments policies for improving the match of qualifications with subjects taught and for developing in-service training as well as for the introduction of teacher appraisal apply to all levels of school teachers and to further education as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the system of appraisal that has been designed by the government is intended to encourage teachers and if necessary to encourage them to take a different tack if the area in which they have been working is not suitable to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords supplementary question gives me the opportunity to say that the government are fully aware that the majority of teachers are able dedicated and work extremely hard <e> <s> indeed the former system of appraisal was intended to ensure that such teachers are recognised <e> <s> the proposals on pay structure made by my right honourable friend will ensure that they can be adequately rewarded in an effort to ensure that the best teachers remain in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the education no <e> <s> act will come into force in september <e> <s> institutions have first a period in which to draw up their codes of practice as required by subsection <e> <s> however my honourable friend has initiated inquiries of the principal of university college cardiff to find out how he expects that the agreement with the students union in practice will help protect freedom of speech <e> <s> in preparing its code of practice the college will need to consider the bearing of section upon this agreement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the governments intention is that free speech should be protected <e> <s> this does not mean that the traditional means of expressing dissent through peaceful demonstration should be inhibited <e> <s> nor does it necessarily rule out some heckling <e> <s> i think your lordships would agree that where the speaker is a member of parliament he or she can reasonably be expected to cope with that <e> <s> the criterion to be applied is whether the speaker is being prevented from speaking <e> <s> clearly continuous heckling or chanting could be designed to have this effect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are aware that the college authorities are taking the necessary steps to prevent the recurrence of such an incident and institutions as a result of the education no <e> <s> act will have to take a position from next autumn to demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable and practical steps to this end <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of that quoted remark <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has himself recently been able to make comments in the same vein <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords and of course once section of the new act is in force it will he for the courts to rule whether particular actions on the part of those under a duty to protect freedom of speech in any way contravene its provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords since the new provision includes a requirement that each institution should establish a code of practice to guide all those concerned in meeting the new duty within the particular institution the government would like those codes to be thoroughly thought through before they are brought into operation <e> <s> that will take a little time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course important that freedom of speech should be protected <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i think that what everybody wants to see is freedom of speech on the university campuses without any problems <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord irving of dartford and lord ritchie of dundee for their comments on this extremely important subject <e> <s> both noble lords have suggested that the attitude of my right honourable friend the secretary of state in making this statement was perhaps a recipe for conflict <e> <s> however i have to say that we have all heard on previous occasions the promise of imminent peace and calm if only there is no interference <e> <s> there have been no fewer than three agreements this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall happily pass on the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> all that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord murray for his intervention but it is not right to say that the agreement signed on friday by four out of the six unions involved has provided an open door for progress <e> <s> the deputy general secretary of nas/uwt has been ready to portray our schools as battlefields <e> <s> indeed i read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> perhaps i can best answer him by emphasising that it is the improvement of the quality of teaching in schools at which the secretary of states package is aimed <e> <s> from the statement let me again quote what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to agree with the noble lord lord howie of troon that the key to education is good teachers <e> <s> from that point on i have to differ with him because of course we believe that the differentials which the government offer and which i have already outlined will provide the necessary key and a career structure for those who are in the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill for his remarks and i can assure him that they will be drawn to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> however as i have already said the secretary of state is and continues to be very willing to consult all parties and to have discussions with them <e> <s> he is seeking a speedy conclusion to the problems and is doing everything in his power to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords we all want to see teachers regarded as a responsible professional body <e> <s> we recognise that many are behaving professionally <e> <s> we must begin to put in place new machinery which will allow this dispute and would have allowed previous disputes to be brought to a close <e> <s> there is no point in perpetuating a negotiating process which has produced never-ending talks but which even after so long still falls short of delivering a final agreement <e> <s> the secretary of state intends to hold to his plans as outlined in the queens speech <e> <s> to do otherwise would leave us with no means of breaking the deadlock <e> <s> it would be imprudent for any government mindful of the course of the dispute to sit on their hands <e> <s> progress will be made toward disbanding burnham <e>", "<cs> my lords there are always difficulties in negotiating with representatives of any group of people because there are always people who suggest that they are not truly representative <e> <s> from our direct contact with teachers we believe that the governments proposals have the support of the vast majority of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not collect statistics on truancy at a national level <e> <s> nevertheless we are aware that unjustified absence is a serious problem in some schools <e> <s> in february the department issued a circular to local education authorities which made a number of recommendations about the work of education welfare officers with a view to concentrating their efforts on school attendance problems <e> <s> progress on this will be monitored early next year <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lord i agree that there may be a link between truancy and juvenile crime but connections are not firmly established in spite of the statistics that he quoted <e> <s> juvenile delinquents often have a history of poor attendance at school <e> <s> but whatever the interaction the government are committed to urgent and effective action to tackle the problem of drug and solvent abuse <e> <s> a booklet giving information and advice to teachers and other education service professionals was issued last year <e> <s> the appointment of a co-ordinator is being funded in each education authority area to combat drug misuse and in-service teacher training related to drug abuse is being supported by the new scheme of inset grants <e> <s> we hope that this together with an attack on the attendance problem will help <e>", "<cs> my lords on hearing my noble friends question my immediate reaction was that absence from school must help guard against smashing the school <e> <s> nevertheless i take on board the example that he has quoted and i assure him that we shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that parents have an important role to play in this <e> <s> where they show an interest in their childrens education and show that they regard education as important truancy is less likely to occur <e> <s> the government in all the steps that they are taking are very keen on introducing and cementing parent power in this as well as in other areas of education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that there is any entitlement for parents to receive these figures but i understand that in many local authority areas they are made available to them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may half answer that supplementary question <e> <s> i agree that teaching needs to be lively and absorbing and that the curriculum has to be seen by pupils and parents to be relevant to encourage pupils to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer must be not many <e>", "<cs> my lords the education welfare officer has an important role here <e> <s> the officers most important duty in the governments view is to investigate and remedy school attendance problems <e> <s> indeed the circular to which i referred in my original answer recommends that education welfare officers devote the major part of their time towards this end <e>", "<cs> my lords although we do not collect statistics on a national level we receive some local surveys including an ilea survey <e> <s> the survey of secondary school pupils absent on one day in produced a figure of nearly absentees <e> <s> that is per cent <e> <s> of the pupil population and it is rather an alarming figure <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been over this ground before <e> <s> it is i believe of the utmost importance that teachers fulfil their proper role in making school and education attractive and interesting to pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the accounts with interest <e> <s> any study claiming results as dramatic as those reported needs to be looked at carefully and officials at the department of health and social security have requested details of the experiment which they will review with the help of their expert advisers <e> <s> responsibility for providing the school meals service rests on the local education authorities not the government <e> <s> i have no doubt however that they will want to follow any advice given by the dhss and the good dietary practices recommended by recent reports <e>", "<cs> my lords we are already aware of the problems to health caused by high fat high sugar and low fibre diets <e> <s> more recently many local education authorities have sought to produce food with reduced additives colouring and preservatives <e> <s> however well conducted studies of the effect of diet including additives on aggressive behaviour and hyperactivity in children have not suggested that diet is generally an important factor <e> <s> so far as the common agricultural policy is concerned it may be blamed for many things but i do not think it could be accused of doing away with a sensible skimmed milk pudding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am assured always that there is no such thing as bad food there is only bad diet <e> <s> local education authorities are increasingly introducing healthy eating campaigns in their school meals service providing higher fibre and lower fat meals and seeking out manufacturers who provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in my original response that the claims made by the study which took place in the united states are being studied very carefully and further details have been asked for <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that all food is good so long as the diet is right and sufficiently varied <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to define what is essentially an american-english expression <e> <s> all i can say is that i am assured that there is no such thing as junk food or bad food <e> <s> only the diet may be bad <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree entirely that a balanced approach to this topic is as important as a balanced diet <e> <s> there is now a much more productive liaison among school meals staff teachers of home economics biology physical education and so on and community dieticians towards helping children choose a more balanced diet and a more sensible way of life <e>", "<cs> my lords copies of the preliminary account of the study to which the noble lord referred were received only at the end of november <e> <s> as i said the information in the study and in particular its methodology requires a good deal more study before judgments can be made about either the accuracy of the report itself or its relevance to schools in this country <e> <s> but i will inform the house and the noble lord in particular of something of which he may already be aware that is the preliminary report of a nutritional analysis of a nationwide dietary survey of british school children which was recently published by the department of health and social security and which covers a wide range of topics <e>", "<cs> my lords this topic is in the hands of local education authorities although the government are always prepared to advise <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that that is somewhat outside the terms of the original question <e> <s> nevertheless dhss catering guidance to hospitals and local authorities is also used by many private caterers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are following with interest the work being done in this area but they are also conducting their own researches <e> <s> as i said there is a preliminary report of findings already available which will be followed up <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the government are most concerned about the quality of the education service provided by the london borough of brent <e> <s> consequently my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has caused a special inspection to take place in accordance with his duty under section of the education act <e> <s> he will give careful consideration to the position in the light of hmi advice and will follow it up as appropriate <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> in connection with miss mcgoldrick my right honourable friend was not satisfied with the authoritys initial statement of its reasons for holding a disciplinary hearing <e> <s> he asked the authority to provide immediately a more detailed explanation which has now been received <e> <s> he is considering whether further action would be appropriate <e> <s> with regard to the case of mr gwyn powell my right honourable friend is concerned about press reports which if accurate paint a most deplorable picture <e> <s> officials in his department have asked the authority for the facts of the case and that matter in turn will be pursued <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> the speed with which the inspection programme has been mounted is clear evidence of the governments concern <e> <s> we acknowledge that the labour party in the shape of its leader of its spokesman for education and of its spokesman for local government has expressed its grave doubts over the mcgoldrick affair <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the position <e> <s> authorities are free to advertise where they want but brents refusal to advertise in a widely read publication because of its political stance on an unrelated dispute is to be condemned <e> <s> it is placing dogma before the needs of children <e> <s> the recent education no <e> <s> act gives increased powers to governing bodies on the recruitment of teachers and we hope that they will use them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that is a little away from the main question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the programme of inspections began in mid-november <e> <s> her majestys inspectorate is talking among others to advisers teachers parents and community groups formally and informally collectively and individually <e> <s> this will continue until february when it is expected that the report will shortly follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i entirely take the noble lords point <e> <s> if he is asking about the salaries of teachers the financing comes from the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the last part of my noble friends supplementary question is indeed a new point <e> <s> i hesitate to commit the government but i shall certainly pass on those remarks to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i can of course assure my noble friend that we are well aware of the situation at willesden college of technology as well as the other incidents to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey the noble lords request to my right honourable friend but as i said so far the department has only press reports to go on and the time between now and the recess is short <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the question of placing dogma before the needs of children is extremely reprehensible <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i understand that the committees recommendation was that new ways should be found of funding the slide library <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the question concerns the university of london library that is the central library and not the more heavily used individual college libraries this is currently operating at a deficit and it is consequently reviewing which of its activities might be reduced or how additional income might be attracted which has given cause to the rumours which prompted the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking a number of measures to attract engineers and other suitably qualified people to change to a career in teaching by for example special funding for initiatives in higher education institutions the development of better industry and education links and the introduction of a bursary scheme for students <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the government welcome the engineering councils concern and interest in this matter <e> <s> i am sure that the industrial affiliate organisation of the engineering council which has a loose network of subscribers from the public utilities and other major industrial companies who gather together to discuss items of common interest will prove extremely helpful and officials are currently giving further consideration to the best ways to tap into this matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely aware of the particular reference in the newspaper report to which the noble lady has referred <e> <s> certainly the government are as i said in a number of different ways taking initiatives to encourage both the increase of training of teachers in these areas and in the form of the city technology colleges in the spread of technology instruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords under the education act the secretary of state has a statutory duty to consider proposals for the reorganisation of schools on their individual merits <e> <s> in exercising that duty he has regard <e>", "<cs> indeed yes my lords <e> <s> the secretary of state is currently considering proposals under section of the education act for the closure of grammar schools <e> <s> whether the schools which my noble friend has mentioned are among those i do not know <e> <s> certainly if proposals are brought forward by a local education authority the consent of the secretary of state is required <e>", "<cs> my lords the closure of any school is approved only when the secretary of state for education and science is satisfied that it is unlikely to be able to sustain its established quality and that the alternative provision is likely to be better <e> <s> decisions must be taken on the individual merits of particular proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords evidence indeed shows a slight statistical correlation between selective schools and enhanced examination results particularly at o-level <e> <s> this will be taken into account by the secretary of state in exercising his statutory duty to decide cases individually on their merits <e>", "<cs> my lords once proposals are published i understand that the secretary of state receives written objections from parents or from anybody else who wishes to write in <e> <s> the views of all parents would therefore be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords parental preference is a very strong consideration in this matter and i am sure that parents will take the opportunity to present their objections in this particular case <e>", "<cs> i understand the concerns about the composition of the advisory committee <e> <s> it is of the utmost importance to get it right <e> <s> however most of us are agreed that the most important aspect of the advisory committee is that it should be independent <e> <s> it should not represent various interests each with its own self-interest but should consist of independent minded people who can look at difficult problems objectively and come up with an appropriate and helpful solution <e> <s> i am not convinced that the committees independence would be enhanced by formal consultations about its membership such as are proposed by amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the suggestion that this amendment is in any way necessary must be nonsense <e> <s> perhaps i can reassure any noble lord in doubt <e> <s> i draw attention to the fact that the main committee which looked at teachers pay and conditions in scotland included within its membership a head teacher and a former member of an education committee <e> <s> it has been a much respected committee and no such formal requirement or limitation was placed on the main committee <e>", "<cs> we are not talking about that <e> <s> we are talking about the composition of the committee <e>", "<cs> it is true that we have always sought to emphasise the interim nature of the advisory committee and frequently refer to it as such <e> <s> therefore we are very happy to accept this amendment <e> <s> there is a consequential amendment that may be required in clause to the definition of the term advisory committee which will then relate to any reference to the committee throughout the bill <e> <s> i suggest that we may be able to cope with this by tabling this evening a government amendment which could be dealt with tomorrow during the later stages of the committee <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to take a break in the proceedings <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i should have said that the break will be until oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall speak at the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> b a and <e> <s> i understand the intention behind these amendments which is to broaden the remit of the advisory committee if not perhaps to turn it into an independent review body as proposed in an earlier amendment but by the back door <e> <s> but doing so could prove counter-productive in terms of what the committee can achieve <e>", "<cs> these amendments may indeed be modest and we do want to avoid any aggravation as the noble lord lord alexander has just referred to it <e> <s> however i must repeat what has been said on many occasions <e> <s> the secretary of states door is open and he is very happy to receive contacts from the organisations that have been referred to <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords concern but in view of the debate which has taken place and the points which have been made from all sides of the committee and indeed from outside the house i think that any secretary of state must take into account the need to consult and take evidence and have his door open <e>", "<cs> that is why there is provision in the bill for the local education authorities and representatives of the teachers to give evidence or to be required to give evidence to the advisory committee as well as to the secretary of state <e> <s> i think there are two stages in which these bodies have the opportunity to make their views well known <e> <s> i believe that those opportunities are adequate within the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> i can inform the noble lord lord mcintosh that the objection in this instance is that the amendment would introduce yet another round of consultations <e> <s> the wording of the bill is perfectly clear <e> <s> it is for the secretary of state to decide what matters are referred to the advisory committee <e> <s> i am sure that the teacher unions and the local authority associations will not hesitate to make their views known to the secretary of state about matters that they feel should be referred to the advisory committee <e> <s> indeed there is no limitation upon the associations and organisations that may do this <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to disappoint the noble lord once again but as things stand both <e>", "<cs> if it helps the noble lord i can say that persons means more than one person <e> <s> i think i made it fairly clear in my earlier intervention that we feel that an entirely independent component within the interim advisory committee will be very important for reasons of objectivity and the wider experience that this can offer <e> <s> therefore we do not feel that it is necessary to have the committee consisting exclusively of educationalists <e> <s> we would welcome other points of view <e>", "<cs> of course we believe that parents have an important role to play in the education of their children and we have already referred to this point in dealing with a previous amendment <e> <s> there may be no statutory requirement to consult parents but there is nothing to prevent organisations representing parents from presenting their views to my right honourable friend who will i feel sure be glad to hear those views and will take them into consideration <e> <s> as a result of last years education act to which the noble lord lord mcintosh has already referred governors of schools and the parent body now more generally have a right to be involved in determining the culture of the school and what is being taught to the children <e> <s> such involvement must benefit the children <e> <s> however when it comes to pay and conditions of service of a particular group of workers in this case teachers that must surely be the province of those directly affected the employers and the employees and the government who provide approximately half the money and have a general responsibility for ensuring an effective education service <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should reply briefly to the points that have recently been made <e> <s> in response to the noble baroness lady seear i believe that i was not guilty of saying that parents have no direct interest in these matters <e> <s> of course we hope that they as responsible parents take an interest <e> <s> but it is not within their province to be involved as a statutory right in the pay and conditions considerations of the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> all i can say to that is that the process envisaged is that once the committees recommendations are passed to the secretary of state the report will be published and parliament itself will have an opportunity to scrutinise the provisions of the order <e> <s> it seems to me that that gives ample opportunity for any matter in the order that has been considered by the advisory committee to be fully and widely debated <e>", "<cs> i will rush in <e> <s> i am very relieved to hear that the noble lord lord mcintosh is happy with the governments version and since the noble lord lord kilmarnock has suggested that he is too i think i need speak no further <e> <s> i trust that the noble lord lord kilmarnock will feel able to withdraw his amendment and that he will in due course support amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i recognise the concern of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton in this matter and his desire to avoid any superfluous references in legislation <e> <s> nevertheless if he were to press this amendment i acknowledge he has said that it is only a probing amendment i very much doubt <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty now because i understood the noble lord lord henderson of brompton to be saying that it would be possible to have a separate document referred to in an order giving details without actually providing for it on the face of the bill <e> <s> so whether or not we provide for it in the bill i believe that we could end up having a separate document <e>", "<cs> i am referring to the amendment to clause page line leave out paragraph a which i have down in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> in fact there are two amendments <e> <s> there is one in the name of my noble friend lord belstead and one in the name of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clarify the position with regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment is necessary in view of amendment no <e> <s> since the particular subsection was subsumed by that amendment <e> <s> therefore the government amendment replaced the original amendment which was put down in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> that has led to the confusion but perhaps we may proceed in the manner suggested by the noble lord lord henderson which will solve the problem <e>", "<cs> in view of the lateness of the hour and the fact that the noble lord lord mcintosh has said that we shall return to this at a later stage at his instigation and indeed under threats of duress from the noble lord the chief whip i think it is preferable that at this stage i do not respond in detail to the remarks of the noble lord lord monkswell <e>", "<cs> we shall certainly look at that point <e>", "<cs> on second reading the government promised to consider sympathetically this point raised by my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> the amendment tabled by my noble friends lady cox and lord beloff would have the effect of protecting the <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i am sorry if i gave the suggestion of any flicker of doubt <e> <s> if there was a flicker of doubt it was in relation to the word opportunity alone <e> <s> we felt that the use of the word reasonable very much strengthened the position <e> <s> nevertheless his comments and the advice behind them will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to add that what is being put forward is the minimum requirement <e> <s> nevertheless the amendment does not exclude anybody and merely guarantees a place for those who are presently on the burnham further education committee <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord feels that it is clear from the bill that these are temporary provisions <e> <s> the long title of course goes to clarify that point <e> <s> in order to make a general point in relation to short titles i should like to quote from the famous case of <e>", "<cs> i apologise for any lack of grace but my understanding is that it is only in very exceptional cases that a qualification such as <e>", "<cs> i would add my comment that there is nothing sinister or inadequate in this provision of schedule which states that the secretary of state may remove a member from office if that member is in the opinion of the secretary of state unable or unfit to discharge the functions of a member <e> <s> contrary to the experience of the noble lord lord kilmarnock and bearing out the case quoted by my noble friend lord elton such provision is standard form in statutory arrangements for committees <e> <s> it appears in the employment and training act in relation to the manpower services commission <e> <s> it appears in the health and safety at work act which was passed by a labour government in relation to the health and safety commission <e> <s> commissions such as the msc have carried out controversial tasks without any suggestion that the power to remove members was being abused <e>", "<cs> i must say as in the previous case that it would be very odd and unusual indeed for the appointment of the chairman to be the responsibility of the members of the interim advisory committee itself <e> <s> it is standard practice for such a sensitive decision to rest with the secretary of state <e> <s> governments of different parties have followed this practice when appointing the chairmen of advisory bodies <e> <s> in addition to the cases quoted by my noble friend lord beloff i point out for example that successive secretaries of state have appointed the chairmen of the university grants committee and the advisory board for the research councils <e> <s> other examples are the business and technician education council and the secondary examinations council <e> <s> none of the chairmen of those bodies is accused of <e>", "<cs> the government have not yet decided who should provide the secretariat for the advisory committee so i feel sure that the comments made by members of the committee this evening will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord harris of high cross for again concentrating our minds on this important issue and indeed for his historical analysis and wide review of the social and economic factors involved <e> <s> this debate has also provided noble lords opposite with the occasion to state clearly their parties policies in this area <e> <s> it will be for the electorate to decide whether even more rigid controls will solve the problem caused to a large extent by existing controls <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a short business statement <e> <s> by agreement through the usual channels the noble baroness lady seear has decided to withdraw the unstarred question standing in her name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the government have made it clear that they do not consider that if this bill is enacted the united kingdom will be in breach of its obligations under the conventions to which the noble lord referred in putting forward his amendment <e> <s> if the united kingdom should act in breach of its international <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend lord skelmersdale may be allowed to deal with this particular aspect of the matter when he winds up the debate <e> <s> it has come to light as a result of investigations into the position in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords home insulation grants have not been withdrawn they are being targeted at those most in need <e> <s> the proposed new scheme would withdraw the general rate of grant at per cent <e> <s> but would extend the availability of the more generous per cent <e> <s> grant <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that by targeting the resources to those most in need we are making the best use of our energy resources <e> <s> the more extended grant will be available not only to those elderly or disabled people who already receive a per cent <e> <s> grant but to all householders who are in receipt of housing benefit or supplementary benefit <e> <s> by <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the proposal will increase the potential number of people who can benefit from the per cent <e> <s> grant by about per cent <e> <s> precise figures are not available <e> <s> we think that the number of eligible householders will increase from milliion to about million <e> <s> more detailed information will be available when the english house conditions survey figures become available <e>", "<cs> my lords the insulation arrangements which are being revised by the government are intended to improve energy efficiency <e> <s> the results of energy efficiency year are still being considered but they already appear to prove that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have increased by per cent <e> <s> gross provisions to local authorities in the housing capital grant programme for <e> <s> there are obviously realigned priorities within that programme <e> <s> one of our first priorities cannot be to assist well-to-do householders to save their money <e> <s> the provision in the scheme announced last december should be enough to meet the expected demand from people who genuinely need help <e>", "<cs> my lords during the eight years that the current scheme has been available we believe that most people able to take advantage of it have done so <e> <s> making grants available to new groups of people who could not otherwise afford insulation will expand the effective market <e>", "<cs> my lords only in devon and cornwall i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords the existing scheme is designed to help people start from scratch or improve their existing insulation <e> <s> there are also schemes which include draught-proofing <e> <s> future arrangements to help with the cost of draught-proofing materials are being considered by the government departments concerned and they would be in addition to insulation <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends upon the extent of the existing insulation <e> <s> as i said the existing scheme covers householders from scratch and improving existing insulation <e> <s> if the existing insulation is less than mm about one inch thick it can be improved up to mm <e>", "<cs> my lords i also said i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we too are most grateful to the noble lord lord stallard for tabling this motion <e> <s> the government fully recognise the importance of the issues that it raises and we are grateful for the many ideas that have been advanced by noble lords from all sides of the house in the course of todays debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that correction <e> <s> i wanted to make that point in case it was in peoples minds that prices were going to be affected as a result <e> <s> the conservation issue is also being taken seriously and is a priority for consideration <e> <s> obviously we must keep an eye on things <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to that point but i am happy to deal with it now as the old scheme is still in operation <e> <s> the announcement which was made in december said that the change would take place next year meaning this year <e> <s> my right honourable friend will lay a scheme before parliament under the negative order procedure <e> <s> therefore the point made by the noble lord that there might be a rush of applications for the existing grant was quite timely <e> <s> there is the interim period during which they are able to submit their applications under the old scheme but at the moment i am unable to tell him the cut-off date <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a date for any announcement on the subject <e> <s> i can only say that consideration has been given to the matter since the statement was made last year <e> <s> i believe that we are close to the time when a decision might be made regarding the alternative arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords this gives me a convenient opportunity to remind the house of the governments position on the bill <e> <s> as my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords since the act it has proved convenient for the extensive provisions relating to teachers pay to be found in a document published by hmso and updated by order as necessary <e> <s> as we have said before the current document contains pages covering such detailed matters as incremental credit for qualifications and experience and rules about a variety of special allowances among other provisions <e> <s> while some pruning may be possible in the future additions on conditions of service may be needed <e> <s> the total length of the material may prove much the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all aware of the problems caused by a surfeit of paper and of amending changes <e> <s> we hope and expect that the system as provided by the bill will prove to be the most convenient and the most manageable <e> <s> the safeguard for parliament is that all orders must pass through the process of parliament so that everybody will be well aware of changes <e> <s> it has worked to have a separate document in the past as we have said since the act <e> <s> we believe that will be the most manageable way of dealing with this problem <e> <s> the document will be revised from time to time <e> <s> there will be no excessive period before a new edition is published and there is no need to publish a new full document each time a minor amendment is made <e> <s> that is the purpose of the provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lords fears are unfounded and that this amendment is in fact entirely redundant <e> <s> i believe there is a short answer to the concerns expressed and that is that the result that the amendment seeks to achieve is already in fact embodied on the face of the bill <e> <s> if i may i should like to remind noble lords of the words of subsection which appears on page line of the bill and which refers to the fact that remuneration <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may try to reassure the noble lord further with regard to clause d which allows schools currently designated as social priority schools to continue to be designated as such and for any other special designations that may be required in the future <e> <s> that is the primary purpose of clause d <e> <s> it does not and cannot refer to taking out of local education authorities control in any way since the scope of the bill is confined to teachers in schools maintained by local education authorities or teachers otherwise employed by local education authorities <e> <s> so i think that the fears as to the open-endedness of clause d to which he refers are in fact unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house before the noble lord presses the amendment to a division i should say that there is nothing in the bill that would in any way enable the government to bypass the local education authorities without primary legislation <e> <s> therefore there is no doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities are responsible for deciding the level of cleaning necessary on their own beaches <e> <s> expenditure which an authority incurs on beach cleaning forms part of its total expenditure towards which the government give support through block grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that as a result of severe storms fronds from the kelp which grows about a mile off worthing beach break loose and are washed ashore and that they cause unsightliness and stench and give rise to fly problems all of which are clearly unwanted on holiday beaches and cause expense to the local authority <e> <s> my understanding is that worthing borough council has called in a firm of consultants to advise on the problem and that the southern water authority has also offered its services and is in touch with the local authority on this issue <e> <s> clearly the government department concerned is well aware of the issue if only in part as a result of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely right <e> <s> the government are right behind the voluntary effort in this sector and fully recognise the work done by the keep britain tidy campaign because we recognise that the long-term solution to the litter problem must lie primarily in persuading the public not to drop litter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take note of the noble baronesss point and will draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state at the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> it is a problem which is widely recognised <e> <s> it does not apply just to worthing and we acknowledge that there are many different forms of seaweed as well <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords and this may be of particular interest to the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> it may well be that the firm of consultants which has been retained by the local council will advise that this is a use and that it is worth spending money on taking up the seaweed and using it in this way as a fertiliser <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i inform your lordships that the revised time for the end of this debate will now be pm <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a vital and challenging topic but before i give an overview of major developments by the government in this important area i should like to thank the noble lord lord sherfield who introduced the motion and who chaired the select committee which has produced the valuable report that we are now discussing <e> <s> perhaps i can also say how much we welcome the opportunity that the debate gives us to hear for the first time in this house from the noble lord lord dainton <e> <s> we look forward to his contribution with considerable interest <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to take a break in proceedings <e> <s> in moving that the house now resume may i suggest that we do not return to this bill before eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> there has already been considerable discussion about the scope of the validation of the secretary of states past decisions on rate limitation and it is now being suggested by means of these amendments that we should in some way aim to validate the decisions so that they cannot be challenged on the grounds of the problems relating to <e>", "<cs> i said that the concession on the greenwich and islington cases was made on the basis of the total expenditure problem <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> as i understand it it is up to the local authorities to challenge the decisions of the secretary of state and so far the local authorities that have done so are the ones to which i have referred <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier the normal period for making these challenges is within three months unless the circumstances are exceptional <e> <s> in the case of all the decisions and orders referred to in the various subsections to which amendments have been proposed i believe that the last order was laid last july which has allowed the local authorities plenty of time <e>", "<cs> i could say that it would be unreasonable to allow them to do otherwise <e>", "<cs> i start by saying that i believe there is no hybridity risk in this clause since all authorities are treated in exactly the same way <e> <s> nor does the clause in any way give the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is in error in his understanding of this point <e> <s> the effect of the clause is to cover only past decisions made by the secretary of state which as i have said have already been laid as orders or in some other way so that there is no future effect as a result of the clause <e>", "<cs> it is not as the secretary of state wishes it is as he has done already and i think that should leave no one in any doubt <e>", "<cs> i was referring to general principles of administrative law which under normal <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has me slightly on this <e> <s> however it is my understanding that although the decisions all relate to occurences in past years in the complicated methods of referring to some of those decisions and their effects the reference to intermediate year is necessary in the subsection in order to make it clear that it relates to past decisions <e> <s> i think elsewhere in the bill will be found although i am not absolutely sure where at the moment a definition of intermediate year <e> <s> courts do give leave in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> therefore it is intended to cover exceptional cases and possibly cases in the pipeline <e>", "<cs> the point which i tried to make earlier is that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> the circumstances in which the general rules of administrative law apply on the grounds of unreasonableness will apply in any event <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if we break our deliberations now <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for the welcome given to my right honourable friends current proposals and also for their recognition of the fact that he has taken into account consultations already held and points raised and comments made during the passage of the teachers pay and conditions act as it now is through this house as well as the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must all recognise and welcome the progress that is being made <e> <s> the profession is receiving a per cent <e> <s> average pay increase and a defined set of conditions <e> <s> therefore a new beginning is opening up <e> <s> while there are already many excellent and respected teachers doing a demanding job in an outstanding way i believe that implementation of the settlement will allow this fact to be reflected throughout the profession <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> i note what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the offer made by the settlement provides a new beginning for our schools <e> <s> i believe that the vast majority of teachers will recognise the need for this and will welcome the pay increases and the new structure <e> <s> i do not believe that teachers like to disrupt schools and i am sure that they will put the interests of the children first <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some trepidation after dare i say it <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i too welcome the opportunity that this debate gives us to consider the operation of the education act as it affects children with dyslexia <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord ritchie of dundee for asking the question and indeed to all noble lords for their interesting and well-informed contributions <e> <s> indeed it fits remarkably well with the debate we had a little earlier this afternoon on the importance of the english language and the case for making it easier to learn <e> <s> we have had a very educational afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have consistently taken the view that the issue of war and peace should be treated in the context in which it arises and not as a separate subject or course <e> <s> this principle applies to the use in schools of the ministry of defence film <e>", "<cs> my lords the film is provided as part of a range of information that is available in the ministry of defence as a back-up or prop to teachers and as a school aid <e> <s> if the subject arises in the natural course of a history or geography lesson the film can be made available <e> <s> it is not obligatory on schools to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords for many years it has been the accepted practice of governments of both political parties to explain government policies whether on defence or other aspects of public interest <e> <s> this is one of the most important issues facing mankind today <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is frequently slotted into the house of lords after prayers it may he the most appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> if i may repeat my original answer the issue of war and peace can arise naturally from many aspects of the curriculum <e> <s> the objection which the government have and have always maintained to peace studies being taught as a separate subject is that it provides a different emphasis <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> as i said before it has been accepted practice for governments of both political parties to provide information <e> <s> the film keeping the peace is not intended to stand alone <e> <s> it provides information on the governments policy as a contribution to an informed debate on the issues of war and peace where those issues arise naturally in the curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not discussing how peace studies should be taught because it has been decided that they should not be taught as a separate subject <e> <s> we are discussing information supplied by a government department as an aid to the teaching of the subject in the natural course of a school curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords provided that there is a proper balance the same rules apply to whatever information is available whether from the government or another source <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing against the subject of peace being considered in schools provided that it arises naturally in the curriculum in relation to the normal studies of history and geography <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is correct to use public funds to explain government policy whether on defence or any other aspect of public interest <e> <s> i have seen the film in question <e> <s> it is extremely informative and provides a balanced picture <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the film that is the subject of this question provides information and not propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be a matter of subjective response <e> <s> in my view it did not eulogise it provided a balanced picture <e>", "<cs> my lords the eight-point plan was agreed with the football authorities on rd february <e> <s> the football league has already asked its member clubs to prepare local plans on crowd control and to introduce membership schemes covering at least per cent <e> <s> of their ground capacity <e> <s> the intention is that the whole of the plan should be in operation before the start of next season <e>", "<cs> my lords this package of measures together with measures already implemented is seen as having the possibility of achieving the maximum effect <e> <s> it reflects the determination of the government the police and the football authorities to work in partnership to tackle hooliganism in the interests both of public safety and of the future wellbeing of the game <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i believe that that was the intention of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and we welcome that co-operation <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary has yet to receive up-to-date statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to quote chapter and verse on that matter <e> <s> however if i obtain any detailed information with which i can supply the noble lord i shall follow up the matter in the ususal way <e> <s> my understanding is that the widest possible consultations have taken place in producing the eight-point plan <e> <s> certainly in regard to local clubs and their local plans wide consultation which must include players as well as supporters clubs will take place <e>", "<cs> my

in the eight-point <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is also another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the police have not yet approached individual schools <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has asked the leader of the inner london education authority to act to ensure that teachers co-operate with the police over the showing of the video <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i believe that the hostility shown by the inner london teachers association at the idea of showing the video has been very much squashed

collaboration between the metropolitan police and the inner london education authority <e> <s> it is intented to teach children particularly very young children to be on their guard as regards possible abduction and child abuse <e> <s> i believe that in the odd project where the film has been shown it has been well received by the children in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly welcome the co-operation of the inner london education authority in this matter <e> <s> however we understand that the inner london teachers association did display hostility initially and i can only say that for any head teacher to adopt a hostile attitude towards the police in this matter as in any other would be both deplorable and unprofessional <e>", "<cs> not offhand my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very timely and instructive debate <e> <s> the large number of speakers which has been matched only by their eminence and distinction will ensure that it will be a most useful

fees <e> <s> that is why the question comes under the comprehensive review of student support of my honourable friend mr walden which is currently under way <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords and we have

the authoritys policy statements and its plans for implementing them is being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords if not before certainly now i am aware of haringeys attempt to side-step the provisions of the education act <e> <s> in fact i understand that the act applies to any sex education taught in schools no matter when where or how it is taught <e> <s> so changing the label does not alter that position <e> <s> in fact sex education is often not a separately timetabled subject but part of a broader programme of personal and social education or health education and so the education act applies <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed aware that haringey argues that its policies are consistent with the law that it is consulting locally on proposed steps to implement the law and that its previous actions have been misreported <e> <s> these claims are being studied <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the report <e> <s> it is a most reprehensible situation but it does not tie in exactly with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all your lordships will welcome any delays in this matter <e> <s> my understanding is that the local education authority adopted a general policy statement on equal opportunites in november and a more detailed report on this in relation to homosexuality last september <e> <s> the primary purpose seems to be to discourage unfair discrimination against homosexuals and other minorities <e> <s> it has currently set up a curriculum working party to develop guidelines for antiheterosexist approaches in schools and the local authority proposes to consult interested parties before adopting the guidelines <e> <s> clearly the subject will arise again when the local authority has come to a firmer decision <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we made our position very clear during the passage of the noble earls bill through this house <e> <s> we understand the reasons for its introduction and we entirely share the concerns which underlie its purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends remarks and would refer your lordships to the date on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government believe that in this context schools should not avoid teaching about homosexuality but that it should be factual balanced and sensitively handled <e> <s> this is particularly important at this moment of time in view of the threat posed by aids <e> <s> my right honourable friend will be addressing this in his forthcoming circular on sex education at school <e> <s> there can be no justification for any teaching which advocates homosexual behaviour or encourages homosexual experimentation by pupils <e> <s> however the main thrust of the governments policy has always been to set any such teaching in a family context <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on higher education and research which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of issues have been raised <e> <s> i am very happy that the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble baroness lady seear have felt able to welcome the statement and the news which it contains <e> <s> i thought that perhaps the noble lords not as bad as it could have been remark was a bit grudging <e> <s> this is in fact very good news <e> <s> and it should be welcome both to the institutions involved and to the public in general <e> <s> it goes to prove that the government do listen and do when necessary revise their policies <e> <s> in this case the government have been reviewing their higher education policies for some time <e> <s> sir keith joseph published a green paper in may and it is in the light of responses to that and of subsequent developments that the government have revised their policies particularly on access and on planning and funding arrangements for polytechnics and colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> i need hardly say that i am grateful to my noble friend the leader of the house for being present so that the wishes of the house in respect of a full debate on this topic will be clearly understood by him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his welcome for the proposals and the proposed new funding council <e> <s> after all that is an acceptance of the recommendations and the broad thrust of the croham committees report <e> <s> its general approach to the shape and functions of the ugcs successor has been taken on board <e> <s> further decisions on the detail will be taken in the light of continuing consultations on the report <e> <s> the ugcs independence cannot be criticised in view of the number of measures upon which it has insisted <e> <s> i believe that the ugc can be pointed to as a body which has proved how valuable independence from government can be <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the queries raised by my noble friend are covered in the white paper <e> <s> in general the effect of the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole process of higher education and these arrangements for higher education are always subject to review innovation and good ideas from any source <e> <s> the form will not be fixed in concrete as a result of the present change <e> <s> the work of sir alistair pilkingtons committee will be considered <e> <s> it is important that polytechnics work out their own links with local industry and to date many have <e> <s> we have seen the benefit that can result from it <e> <s> we are of course aware of the good management practice working group which has been studying the position <e> <s> it includes a representative of the department of education and science <e> <s> the working groups brief does not go as far as the arrangements which are currently being made <e> <s> although i believe that the report is to be published shortly it would not fully solve the problem that we feel we have tackled in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will excuse me i hope to hear his question in a moment <e> <s> turning to the important question of wales which i expected would be raised the noble lord lord cledwyn will be well aware that that is the responsibility of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> my understanding of the differentiation is that the welsh system is smaller and very few colleges concentrate on higher education so that the need for change is different <e> <s> i believe that there is in fact only one polytechnic in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the words national and local are both to be taken within the context of the word wales <e> <s> does that help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments and i shall draw them to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the funding and other arrangements to be made by the universities are very much questions for the universities and the new funding council to work out <e> <s> as was explained fully in the statement the governments contribution does not represent a cut in funding in any way <e> <s> our aim is to urge the universities to co-operate with local industry to encourage industry to have schemes which will help to provide funding from the private sector and also to make the best possible and most efficient use of the funds that are available <e>", "<cs> my lords the first phase of strike action called by the nut and nas/uwt took place between th and th march <e> <s> the information that we have is that about a third of teachers went on a half-day strike <e> <s> the same unions called a second phase of action which began last week <e> <s> the proportion of the countrys schools affected by selective strike last week was per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the total <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand my noble friends concern and indeed the concern of parents and the public generally <e> <s> the action being encouraged by the two unions which i mentioned is quite unjustifiable but the scale of the disruption is so far very limited <e> <s> perhaps i may remind my noble friend that amma voted against action and pat is not in the business of any strikes <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords and it is hoped that the arrangements being introduced now as a result of the teachers pay and conditions act will give a fresh start and will show teachers parents and pupils exactly where they stand particularly in regard to conditions of service <e> <s> we hope that the fresh start will improve conditions in schools generally <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand the problems of the inner london education authority <e> <s> i also acknowledge that it is having to face particular disruption <e> <s> even today strike action was called because it had at last decided to adopt sensible arrangements for redeploying supernumerary teachers <e> <s> we recognise the problems of certain local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of this <e> <s> we consider it most reprehensible action on the part of the teachers concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the teachers pay and conditions act requires the secretary of state to set up the interim advisory committee on schoolteachers pay and conditions and i think that the interim period that this gives the secretary of state to consider and consult on future arrangements is generally welcomed <e> <s> i can perhaps do best by quoting what my right honourable friend recently wrote to three of the teachers unions <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords all universities have responded to the university grants committees request for detailed information about the steps they are taking to implement the recommendations of the jarratt report <e> <s> the ugc will submit a report and commentary to my right honourable friend the secretary of state by july this year <e>", "<cs> my lords almost all universities say that they are implementing the recommendations of the jarratt report and profess themselves to be in favour in principle <e> <s> but we recognise that there are different structures in different universities and sometimes procedures do not quite fit <e> <s> however as i said the university grants committee is still analysing the universities responses in order to determine what practical action has been taken <e> <s> we shall take note of the noble lords remarks in that context <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but in this case i think we must await the final analysis in july before further action is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the longer funding horizon proposed by the jarratt report the white paper on higher education rejects the idea of government funding for the new funding council being fixed for a series of three-year periods <e> <s> the government believe that the rolling triennium effectively offered by the public expenditure survey is a better means of indicating future funding levels <e> <s> as for the funding arrangements between the proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that this is a period of change <e> <s> nevertheless it is important that such changes as have been agreed should be seen to be implemented as rapidly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i will most certainly pass on the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that one of the messages of the jarratt report is that leadership within universities may have swung too far in favour of senates and away from councils and the procedures which have been followed through are helping to counteract that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ezra has raised a matter of continuing and considerable importance and i am most grateful to him for putting the question so positively in asking in effect for a progress report on the repair and renovation of the housing stock <e> <s> one of the vital things to remember about the housing stock is that it is constantly changing changing in response to changes in demand in living patterns and in expectations <e> <s> all this is a perfectly healthy sign of a vigorous market <e>", "<cs> my lords just over has been allocated to the college for capital and recurrent expenditure during the academic year <e> <s> costs of are likely to be incurred on adult education state awards for students studying at ruskin during the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords the government continue to recognise that the provision of long-term residential education for adults by colleges such as ruskin complements the range of educational opportunities available for adults in the country and the education offered by the college is regarded generally as sound <e>", "<cs> my lords ruskin certainly has a place in the education system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the government review the the science budget each year in the course of the public expenditure survey and have shown themselves ready to provide extra resources when urgent needs are identified <e> <s> but there can be no automatic supplementation to meet rising costs <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in fact the united kingdom government spend more on university and research council research as a proportion of gross domestic product than some of our competitors notably japan and the united states of america <e> <s> but industry in those countries spends more on research than does industry in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try my best to answer that question as positively as possible <e> <s> in fact academics will be getting a very substantial pay increase in terms of the per cent <e> <s> which is to be phased over the period from st december to st march <e> <s> employers will also have discretion to pay more to the best people <e> <s> so our policy of selectivity and concentration will mean better facilities for outstanding groups who are most at risk of being drawn overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret i am not able to do that without notice but i shall endeavour to find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords we do indeed recognise the many commitments involved for people running budgets in this particular field <e> <s> but i should like to emphasise that the government are not reducing and have not reduced the science budget in any way <e> <s> in fact the expenditure plans announced last november allowed for a cash increase of million or per cent <e> <s> between and <e> <s> since then the government have also agreed to provide an additional million over the next three years for aids research as well as the million announced on st april this year <e> <s> the science budget for now stands at a total of million an increase of per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e> <s> we hope and expect that the institutions involved will be able to manage better as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords the million which was announced on st april is intended to be additional money to buy more first-class science highly selectively <e> <s> that is the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass my noble friends comments to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> that matter and the whole subject of scientific research is kept under constant review by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that we must get the best value from the substantial funds which are available <e> <s> i have already referred to the fact that the funds for stand at a total of million <e> <s> it is the hope of the government that those funds will be concentrated on outstanding research groups and will provide more selectivity in the areas which we support <e> <s> the important matters in this area are that there should be a great deal of competition for the resources available and that there should be new ideas and new initiatives <e> <s> the challenge is to concentrate on getting the best possible results <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always a drain sometimes the drain goes in both directions <e> <s> however we understand that it is not significant <e> <s> it is most important in areas of advanced research on any subject that there should be international liaison <e> <s> that is all part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are prepared to acknowledge and i have already acknowledged that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord speaking from the benches from which he speaks will recognise the importance of international co-operation and the movement of peoples <e> <s> i think that the results must be self-evident <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i said previously that there is a two-way flow <e>", "<cs> my lords i must emphasise that the most recent study which was based on facts and figures then available and which goes back to showed that the output and influence of british science was still ahead of that of all the other oecd countries except the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the government plan to continue their present policy of providing financial assistance for some insulation measures and targeting this on those most in need <e> <s> housing authorities can determine their own priorities for insulation within the financial resources for housing available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the effects of home insulation <e> <s> indeed the take-up under the existing scheme is very satisfactory <e> <s> results from the survey carried out by audits of great britain indicate that only per cent <e> <s> of private dwellings with loft spaces now have no insulation <e> <s> our aim is now to target help on those who most need it that is those on housing benefit and supplementary benefit and it is therefore much more sensible to increase the amount available to those in real need rather than pay out a smaller amount to many who could afford it <e>", "<cs> my lords the new targets for the scheme are intended to help more people at a lower level <e> <s> the calculations which have been undertaken lead us to believe that this will increase substantially the number of homes with insulation <e> <s> as the noble lord knows there are three different departments involved in these schemes <e> <s> in terms of energy efficiency and the projects brought forward during that period the department of energy has played and is playing a vital role <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too well aware that we have had previous questions and indeed a full debate on the topic <e> <s> i can only go on the figures that are available to the government which we believe are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords just slightly adapting the opening words of the recent white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> that is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the fact that the consultative document on contracts was in the pipeline <e> <s> i think i can reassure the noble baroness by saying that it is likely to be published within the very near future <e> <s> as i said that should meet the queries that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill before your lordships implements the main findings of the committee chaired by mr edward nugee qc which examined the problems of management in privately <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that my noble friend lord coleraine was the first of a number of your lordships who feel that the timing of the passage of the bill leaves something to be desired <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean of beswick suggested that the bill should have been brought forward earlier <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord donaldson have said it is a long and complex bill <e> <s> we recognise that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord graham for their remarks and their welcome for these orders <e> <s> on the question of membership i recognise that this is an area of great interest and one that is most important if the urban development corporations are to carry out their work satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords that may go some way to reassure the noble lord and the noble baroness <e> <s> consultation with the local authorities has taken place and the government aim to strike a proper balance between local authority and other membership <e> <s> however they have insisted that all members are people with local interests or roots <e> <s> i am sure that everyone will argee that that is the most desirable aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by saying that as always on these occasions this has been a wide-ranging and most fascinating debate <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that protection of our environment is a continuing government commitment <e> <s> we are keen that the nations of europe should put into practice the policies which we collectively develop <e> <s> i believe that we need not be ashamed of our record <e> <s> alone among member states apart from those most recently joined the united kingdom has never been taken to the european court of justice for failing to implement a european community directive on the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid there is very little time and i cannot give way there may be time at the end of the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord gibson asked what will replace structure plans <e> <s> our proposals for replacement of the cumbersome process of structure planning were established last year <e> <s> i cannot describe them in detail now because of time constraints but i can assure the noble lord that district councils will not be left without guidance from the county councils on the key issue of planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at liberty to reveal what the government will do at that point

debt both principal and interest and its <e>", "<cs> my lords absolutely so <e> <s> they took upon themselves the business of lending to these local authorities on normal commercial terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot provide my noble friend with details on the number of such arrangements <e> <s> in terms of protection for creditors and for anybody else who lends on this basis of course the normal preference rules apply <e>", "<cs> my lords what can be done we hope is to persuade local authorities not to behave in this extravagant and outrageous manner <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have taken action to deal with a number of devices used by local authorities including deferred purchase arrangements <e> <s> the measures we have taken will apply equally to all authorities <e> <s> of course i am aware of the case of harrogate borough council <e> <s> it entered into a deferred purchase arrangement in to finance the construc <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of what happens in these situations is that first the local authorities must apply to the public works loan board and if the board finds that it cannot meet the liability the auditor can institute proceedings surcharging and disqualifying councillors and the responsibility is that of the councillors themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in present circumstances the public works loan board could not lend to an authority which chose to act illegally or which appeared unable to service and repay debt even under its lender of last resort facility <e> <s> we have no present plans to alter this arrangement and i trust that the authorities which are so vigorously mortgaging the future will recognise this fact <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware that a number of authorities have used creative accounting devices simply to flout the governments expenditure controls <e> <s> they have knowingly mortgaged their future at the expense of their ratepayers and have entered into these schemes with their eyes open <e> <s> we have made it abundantly clear to both them and to the city that we shall not bail them out <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that has always been the aim of the government in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the public works loan board will not perform its function only if local authorities are acting illegally <e> <s> any arrangements and guarantees into which the government have entered will be honoured <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that and i hope that the local authorities will hear it too <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move

why we particularly welcome the results of the report which actually provide sound facts which were not available before <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat that the governments intentions concerning the policy of selectivity and concentration of research when they have had time to bite will mean that outstanding people will increasingly remain in this country and find opportunities

said the consultation document is about to be issued so there will be ample time to consult further in detail <e> <s> however i can give the noble lord the assurance that there is no intention of change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm my noble friends understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the decision of that meeting of the education committee on tuesday last week

refute the statement made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are going a bit wide of the specific question <e> <s> nevertheless i rejoice that the result of the general election is providing the country with the opportunity to decide whether it wants more choice in the field of education <e>", "<cs> my lords i happily agree with my noble friend and say that we should all rejoice in the excellence that these two schools have provided <e>", "<cs> that is a promise i can cheerfully give my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view which was stated on a number of occasions

personal experience <e> <s> i am sorry to hear that there is this feeling among the students at sixth form colleges <e> <s> nevertheless we believe that the decision which as i have said was fully debated during the act was the correct one <e> <s> however we feel that schools should encourage the participation of senior students as much as possible in the general running and considerations of the welfare of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure of that and i hope that once they are they will exercise that vote in the many opportunities that are available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords we

area of research and development is a serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that those subjects will continue to be treated as cross-curricular themes and that initiatives such as the tvei will continue to have scope to operate <e> <s> what has happened so far is that of the two groups set up earlier this year the science curriculum working group has been asked to cover the practical use and application of computers and information technology and the mathematics curriculum working group has been asked to have regard to this and the development of economic

understanding is again a cross-curricular theme which will be dealt with by a number of working parties that have been set up <e> <s> i referred to that as a specific one where instructions have already been given on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for her supplementary question i reiterate that the duty to provide basic training lies with the local education

are running pilot projects and consider the next steps to take as a result of that evaluation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is indeed an important consideration <e> <s> we believe that as a result of underlining and increasing the responsibilities of school governors we shall be in a position to attract more people to take on that important and valuable role <e>", "<cs> my lords it will

act as governors <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> indeed the open university already has a video and a course for school governors that has been used very effectively <e> <s> the government are following that up and consulting the open college which we also feel has a role to play in this context as well as the bbc voluntary organisations and specialist publications <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of helping people who are prepared to give their time and energy to operate as school governors obviously lies in the area of facilitating them with expenses and expenses payments <e> <s> that in fact already occurs <e> <s> obviously it would be helpful since we hope that there will be a large number of governors representing employer interests if the private sector helps in that <e>

employees are governors <e> <s> the bbc and the civil service are also giving paid leave for the task <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend has drawn my attention to a very interesting analogy <e> <s> we are looking closely at the very effective training which is given to magistrates <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the commonwealth programme will not be located in any one country <e> <s> it is to be a network of distance learning activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that we do have unique experience in the field <e> <s> however i believe that the documentation unit and the credit transfer register at the open university will be central parts of the network <e> <s> those are the facilities which the british government have offered <e> <s> the documentation unit already houses lists of prospectuses from all distance learning institutions in the world <e> <s> that will he developed to serve the needs of the network <e> <s> i think that those facilities are potentially just as important as the co-ordinating centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we will provide a valuable and essential part of the proposed network <e> <s> however i agree with the noble baroness that the overseas development agency has collaborated with many british institutions over the years including the bbc and the open university <e> <s> it has a particularly close working relationship with the british council <e> <s> all that experience will serve what is not simply a british but a commonwealth network <e>", "<cs> my lords the principles were agreed by the heads of government in vancouver for co-operation in distance learning <e> <s> what is now being set up is a committee to study the detailed arrangements <e> <s> no doubt the remarks of the noble baroness will be taken into account in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords no reason at all that i can think of <e> <s> we welcome the fact that canada is prepared to contribute on that scale <e> <s> perhaps i may take this opportunity to draw it to your lordships attention that the british government on a bilateral basis has funded correspondence colleges in several southern african countries adult education courses in kenya the development of the indira ghandi open university in india and the consultancy study of distance learning in the commonwealth commissioned by the commonwealth secretariat as part of the exercise leading to the briggs report <e> <s> in those ways we are helping other commonwealth countries to play important roles in the commonwealth network <e>", "<cs> my lords in this matter i can speak from personal experience <e> <s> i attended on behalf of the british government the commonwealth education ministers conference in nairobi earlier this year <e> <s> the british government were the first government to offer financial support or facility for the project <e>", "<cs> my lords the two facilities to which i referred earlier the documentation unit and the credit transfer register are likely to cost the government between million and million over a period of five years as estimated <e> <s> we remain committed to a detailed study of the project and as a result of that funding will be considered in the overall context <e>", "<cs> my lords when studying the advisory boards report the government are considering any additional resources that may be required <e> <s> they are well aware of the debate and the comments made by your lordships during it <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of education and science published a paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the figures published in the departments december statistical bulletin / show an even higher differential than that quoted by the noble baroness <e> <s> however the figures in the bulletin were derived simply by dividing relevant expenditure by the relevant student population <e> <s> they are crude calculations which take no account of differences in the funding arrangements under which each sector operates nor of the very different research efforts in the two types of institution <e>", "<cs> my lords i find i cannot be in agreement with the noble baroness on her last point <e> <s> however i would judge that the greater clarity in planning and accountability which are likely to be introduced with the new universities funding council and the polytechnics and colleges funding council in the proposals in the education reform bill will make comparisons of various kinds much more possible <e>", "<cs> hear hear my lords <e> <s> the government certainly recognise the excellent job which has been done in the polytechnics over the years <e> <s> it is precisely because the polytechnics and colleges have been so successful in what they do best that the government are offering them the new deal set out in the education reform bill <e> <s> nevertheless the two sectors are not the same <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the situation is not as simple as some noble lords may have suggested <e> <s> we believe the two sectors do retain and will retain differences in important aspects of their provision <e> <s> the universities after all have a considerable commitment to basic research while the polytechnics and colleges are mainly teaching institutions <e> <s> the government will continue to address the funding of all higher education on the basis that the provision is different <e>", "<cs> my lords it is taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am fully aware of the institution which conducts its arrangements in that way <e> <s> all i can say is that in the debate and discussions which have been carried on in the light of the education reform bill all manner of new ideas and concepts were brought up <e> <s> the whole question of our total education system is under continual review <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments proposals in the education reform bill are to give the polytechnics autonomy and to release them from the financial control of local education authorities <e> <s> with the powers of financial delegation that they will now have they will be far better able to cope with the priorities of each individual institution <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord is aware of the true position which is outlined in the bill <e> <s> the funding of the polytechnics will be given to the pcfc the new funding council that is to be set up but each individual institution will have considerable control of its own financial arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords ultimately it is the taxpayer who gives the money to everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had occasion to say thank you already <e> <s> last week i was at the launch of a pilot project which is supported by the department of education and science through a programme called pickup which is based upon an initiative by the engineering council <e> <s> it gave me a suitable forum for saying thank you on that particular front <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that question <e> <s> on all fronts the government are encouraging the easier access of women to the professions and to kinds of work which were not normally feminine occupations <e> <s> the government have taken action to increase the number of engineering and technology places in <e>", "<cs> my lords the various initiatives taken by the government particularly in terms of the proposals for a national curriculum are intended to ensure that computer knowledge is widespread across all fields of education <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that not only the government but the engineering council will subscribe to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what to say about that matter since my father was an engineer <e> <s> it is for the engineering industry to be concerned about pay <e> <s> the government can do all that is possible for them to do in terms of ensuring that the engineering workforce is properly prepared and educated <e> <s> it is then for the employers and the industry to ensure that they get the best possible people to perform the jobs by offering the best possible salaries <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that the access courses which are being supported by the government in various institutions are designed primarily to ensure that discrimination should not take place <e>", "<cs> my lords in the conclusions of the document published by the engineering council on restructuring of higher education resources were not referred to at all <e> <s> but i understand that the responses are expected to be finally in at the end of april at which time we can assess the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise the many advantages of the type of course to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> our aim is to start at a very early age in inspiring young people to find interest in occupations such as engineering by involvement with employers and industry in the education process in schools and colleges <e> <s> however it is for the higher education planning bodies the ugc and the national advisory board to advise the government on what action should be appropriate as a consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the university of essex has many highly esteemed departments <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend alongside says per cent <e> <s> most certainly the government consider that the education support grant programme has been a success <e> <s> there has been a great deal of valuable activity covering all age groups and many areas of the curriculum as well as aspects of local education authority management <e> <s> all the local education authorities have received some esg support over the three years of its existence and for the round each category was overbid <e> <s> in total the bids for activities other than those which are essentially formula based amounted to times the envisaged expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly he happy to write to the noble lord with the detail he requested <e> <s> i can in general respond that there appears <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can agree with the noble lord <e> <s> last week i visited two colleges of further education both of which welcomed very much the influence and effect of the education support grant provision in their establishments <e> <s> in fact taking a particular example over million of expenditure on it in non-advanced further education has been supported and local education authorities have had the opportunity to bid for around worth of equipment for each of their colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that he will say the same thing but no doubt in an inimitably welsh way <e>", "<cs> my lords the details of the programme have yet to be finalised <e> <s> certainly the training needs of school governors is an important issue in the light of the educational reforms and will be considered when the esg programme is drawn up for the next period <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend refers to a figure of some per cent <e> <s> in relation to non-observance of this requirement <e> <s> the government are not aware of such evidence and indeed i should be surprised if that figure were correct <e> <s> if the noble lord has such evidence i should be grateful if he could supply it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are fully committed to maintaining the requirement for a daily act of worship to take place in all maintained schools for all pupils and the proposals for change contained in the education reform bill do not affect that general requirement in any way <e> <s> the whole area of the teaching of religious education is of course separate <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the existing law on collective worship was first criticised officially in by the education science and arts committee report on primary education <e> <s> subsequently a consultation exercise was carried out by the department of education and science in which revealed overwhelming support from educational and church bodies for greater flexibility in the timing and organisation of daily collective worship <e> <s> certainly the design and size of secondary school premises make it more difficult than the authors of the act envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the benefit of his considerable experience in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> the response to the consultation process from the churches and educational establishments is what has led to the provision in the bill <e> <s> clause of that bill provides that such arrangements may in respect of each school day provide for a single act of worship for pupils or for separate acts of worship for pupils in different age groups or in different school groups <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i shall happily draw this point to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> however i should like to repeat that the government are fully committed to maintaining the requirement for a daily act of worship to take place in schools because they feel that this is an important part of the school programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions for greater flexibility by allowing acts of collective worship under the proposals in the bill to take place at different times and in different groups will enable representatives of outside interests to participate in these acts of worship <e> <s> it is something that we would welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for reminding me that i omitted to add this point in answering the original supplementary question of my noble friend <e> <s> the act provides that a pupil may be excused from attending collective worship at the request of his or her parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can confirm it but we certainly hope and expect that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to agree with my noble friend that the singing of hymns can uplift the spirit and the memorising of the words of hymns even more so <e> <s> the arrangements that are proposed will be met by the individual schools and it is proposed that head teachers in consultation with the governors will make the necessary arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble baroness and the noble lord for their comments i must say as a preliminary how surprised i am that they were both shocked and forced to resort almost to rudeness <e> <s> i find it rather difficult to discern this in the case of the noble lord lord ritchie <e>", "<cs> it is a her actually the noble baroness lady blackstone <e> <s> she has been quoted when she spoke at a conference on this matter <e> <s> she told us that we should have the courage of our convictions and abolish the authority for this very reason in order to have proper and orderly progress <e> <s> however i shall endeavour to respond to the questions raised both by the noble baroness and by the noble lord lord ritchie <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will forgive me if perhaps i do not get my responses in quite the right order or put them quite as gracefully as i should wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his intervention <e> <s> it is certainly true in terms of size that ilea is the largest local education authority in england <e> <s> it has therefore developed commensurately large support services <e> <s> clearly from some of the examples i have given size does not guarantee effectiveness <e> <s> in fact the outer london boroughs have been responsible for education for over years and three of them harrow kingston and barnet achieved better examination results than anywhere else in the country <e> <s> that is a very hopeful and happy prospect to which to look forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the standard of education available in london is the paramount consideration <e> <s> we believe that the continued failure of ilea to put its house in order makes an arrangement such as we are proposing the best way of raising standards for children in inner london <e> <s> i can only say that there was a lot of fuss and bother about the abolition of the greater london council and the metropolitan counties but who is missing them now <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the last point made by my noble friend there will no doubt be a transitional period with the continued existence of a rump <e> <s> however the process will no doubt be speeded up <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention underlining some of the comments which have been made and indicating how important and urgent it is to get on with the job now <e>", "<cs> my lords we are learning in relation to ilea and i can assure the noble lord that he will have no further problems because there will be no further elections in ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his courteous introduction to his comments <e> <s> however i must disagree with him <e> <s> the subject is not a new one which has been brought up overnight <e> <s> the whole question of ilea and its future has been under discussion for a considerable length of time <e> <s> it was a manifesto commitment that action would be taken and the subject has been well discussed both in the media and in education circles <e> <s> i do not think that it can be regarded as a sudden move requiring a separate bill <e> <s> furthermore the new clauses will be introduced at committee stage in another place <e> <s> there will be ample time under the guillotine motion for a discussion <e> <s> there will be further time for discussion at report stage <e> <s> the emphasis must now be on action rather than further discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her comments and for underlining the fact that the present proposals remove the uncertainty which existed and which indeed was growing <e> <s> the government are carrying on a continuing consultation process on education reform <e> <s> they are responding not only in this area but in other areas to comments and consultation <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the age of miracles has not passed <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for reminding me to put in a word for the teachers the very good teachers who do indeed perform miracles in some of londons schools <e> <s> i believe that those teachers will welcome these moves because they will be able to continue teaching in the schools and provide education with less interference than was experienced under ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to accept the point made by the noble lord because if he is talking about resources for schooling there has been no indication that those resources will be reduced <e> <s> in fact our aim is that the available resources should be used more cost-effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to judge competing evidence which is put forward <e> <s> however the governments evidence has been that an orderly and rational progression to the splitting up of ilea will be the best possible solution that will find acceptance and support among parents and teachers in the boroughs concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i have tried to draw your lordships attention to the fact that these proposals should not be taken out of the context of the other proposals in the education reform bill <e> <s> neither should they be taken out of the context of the proposed new system of local government finance <e> <s> any arguments therefore for cross-subsidy of education from one inner london borough to another will no longer apply <e> <s> we believe overall that the new system will provide a fairer means of distributing resources to local authorities taking account of local social needs <e> <s> boroughs will have an opportunity to examine the cost of education in their areas in this light <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of the outer london boroughs perhaps i may remind the noble lord that they took over not only the education functions but also all other functions <e> <s> they managed to do that successfully in the time <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be a matter for another place <e> <s> the governments timetable motion in another place is the most generous for years <e> <s> the government have made it plain that they will allow additional time to debate these issues <e> <s> tomorrow there is to be a full days extra debate in another place and a supplementary timetable for the committee and report stages is being agreed <e> <s> there will be a full discussion <e> <s> as we discussed last week on the statement the whole question of the governments manifesto commitment and the consultation process that followed have been taken into account in introducing these changes to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that we have already had a very full consultation process on the principle behind the changes <e> <s> we had it in the lead up to the general election last year <e>", "<cs> we had it in the consultation process which followed the general election and we are continuing to have it <e> <s> as the government have always said they are listening to the comments that are being made and in taking those comments into account they are making these changes <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate on the statement last week we discussed fully why the arrangements for the break-up of the inner london education authority were being changed <e> <s> the question tabled today is directed at how those changes will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble baroness will forgive me <e> <s> perhaps i should have said discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall start by apologising to the noble baroness for referring to her in her absence last week <e> <s> i had no intention of mentioning her name <e> <s> however it was expressly at the request of noble lords opposite that i referred to her by name <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that i quoted faithfully from her statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue of ilea was in any event to be debated during the course of the bill <e> <s> we are not deviating from the principle we are merely deviating somewhat in the detail <e> <s> i appeal to noble lords opposite to ask their friends in the inner london boroughs not to indulge in expensive and acrimonious campaigns but to accept the realities of life and to co-operate in an orderly transfer of functions in the childrens best interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the principle of the changes to ilea and the devolution of ilea to the boroughs was already well-established <e> <s> it is merely a question of the method by which we shall do it and the timing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that there is a variety of opinion about our proposed plans <e> <s> however we believe that we are responding to the wishes of the majority on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords difficulties and those of the head teacher <e> <s> we believe that taking together all the proposed reforms in the education system schools in small boroughs will be in a better position than they might have been had those reforms not been put in place <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i can neither confirm nor deny the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the evidence suggests that the higher level of vacancies in the south east is due to the price of housing rather than rates of pay <e> <s> however a similar pattern of vacancies can be found in other professions <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have launched a wide range of initiatives designed to remedy the shortage of teachers in certain subjects <e> <s> those initiatives include a bursary of some for trainee maths physics technology and craft design technology teachers <e> <s> there are also many other initiatives including training such as two-year beds and part-time courses using distance learning <e> <s> there is nationwide publicity with the new regionally based unit the teaching as a career unit to promote teaching as a career and million has been set aside in for in-service training for teachers teaching shortage subjects who are perhaps not properly or fully qualified to do so the so-called hidden shortage <e> <s> so there are a number of ways in which the government are making an effort to tackle the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have those figures at present <e> <s> i do not know whether they are readily available but if they are i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord on that question <e> <s> however we have now removed that uncertainty <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i was of course speaking of our intentions <e> <s> by putting forward our proposals we believe that we have removed a great deal of the speculation and uncertainty that has arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords the main impact of schemes of financial delegation will be at local level <e> <s> the manpower implications for the department of implementing the bill have been taken into account in the manpower plans for set out in the public expenditure white paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the departments manpower is planned to rise from on st january this year to an average of in <e> <s> this increase takes into account the extra workload related to the bill overall <e> <s> when schemes are actually submitted some redeployment of that manpower may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are considering what extra costs might fall to local education authorities for example in the training of head teachers and governors the promotion of schemes and the introduction of new information systems and whether any additional support may be needed <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state is thinking along the lines of the possiblity of specific grant support for implementaion of these functions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we sincerely hope that will be the case <e> <s> indeed there is considerable experience already in the country since i believe some per cent <e> <s> of local authorities already have pilot projects under way in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that we are likely to be discussing this in some detail in the future when the bill comes before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the figures which i have quoted for any increase in civil servants show that it will be a very small increase in a department that is already very small <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is perhaps being slightly mischievious in putting that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i quoted the projected figures at the outset in response to the first supplementary question <e> <s> i think that those small increases are in line with a trend which has developed over the last few years <e> <s> but i should perhaps have said in relation to the previous supplementary question that i would like to underline that the pupil/teacher ratio in this country is at the best level ever <e> <s> it is currently to one and it is going down <e>", "<cs> my lords i would reply to that by saying that they have adequate expertise and knowledge to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very wide supplementary question <e> <s> we have gone through a considerable consultation process since the original plans were announced in the governments manifesto <e> <s> in relation to the particular area of financial delegation there are of course a number of authorities where schemes are under way and where there is experience <e> <s> in addition to all this coopers lybrand have prepared a specific study for the government which has been published and is available to all concerned <e> <s> we have always said that the consultation process is an ongoing one and judging by the number of responses which we are still receiving it still it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken note of the remarks of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords although few in number this evening the quality of the observations made demonstrates once again the interest and knowledge of members of your lordships house on a wide variety of topics <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support shown for the bill by both speakers and i shall attempt to deal briefly with the questions that were raised <e>", "<cs> the information is not available in the form requested <e> <s> since pupils in england and wales have not been classified in accordance with categories of handicap <e> <s> the total number of children with statements in england and wales in january was <e> <s> of these were attending special schools maintained by local education authorities and were attending ordinary schools maintained by local education authorities <e> <s> the bill to establish grant-maintained schools is at present before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are running out of time <e> <s> if the noble lord is not satisfied with the numerous ways i have described in which we are going to meet this challenge perhaps i may be permitted to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be as brief as possible <e> <s> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his supplementary question <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree with the suggestion that this service will be given a low priority <e> <s> the voluntary sector provides a very valuable and highly regarded service in this area <e> <s> the government believe that a continuing statutory voluntary partnership in the delivery of the youth service within the boroughs will lead to good value for money <e> <s> this partnership is well established <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking the boroughs of inner london to produce development plans for the whole of the education services consideration will be given to the provision that they are suggesting in the youth service area <e> <s> i am setting up arrangements for meetings with representatives of voluntary organisations to hear their ideas <e> <s> it is still early days but there will be full consultation and dialogue <e> <s> the best possible arrangements will be made which may well include co-operation between two or more boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> nevertheless to reassure the noble lord i would point out that the secretary of state is going through a series of meetings with representatives of local boroughs as well as with representatives of ilea <e> <s> guidance will be issued after royal assent <e> <s> development plans will have to be submitted by each local borough and vetted by the department <e> <s> there is a special unit in the department to help and advise <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will be asking for development plans for each borough to be presented before the end of february of next year in relation to the provision for april <e> <s> we believe that in this way there will be plenty of time to cover any gap period to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords not only is the secretary of state aware we believe also that local councils are aware of the youth service machinery already in place in their areas <e> <s> we believe that the voluntary sector working with local councils will be closer to the needs of communities and that there will be appreciation of the effective work undertaken by voluntary organisations in those communities <e> <s> furthermore local communities will be able to bring pressure to bear on their local councils to sustain the work of voluntary organisations serving their needs which as i have already said perform an extremely valuable role <e>", "<cs> my lords the boroughs will need to review the organisation and cost of the youth service and the other services that they will be undertaking <e> <s> the voluntary sector of the youth <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will provide funding for the whole of the education service <e> <s> we are taking every possible step to ensure that the youth service is included within the general arrangements and that it is not forgotten or left aside <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has raised an important point <e> <s> we wish to emphasise the fact that we believe that the youth service in particular can be better handled at a more local level <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is wide of the original question but i shall bear in mind the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the time limits which are likely to be put upon us and in view of the need to provide for the gap period to which my noble friend lady faithful referred we believe that at this stage it is best to get on with matters <e> <s> the consultation and dialogue will certainly continue and i believe that the noble lords point will be met by the issue of guidance which it is intended to publish after royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> considerable time and effort over the past decade have gone into the planning of the gcse probably more than for any other examination or curriculum change of which we are aware <e> <s> we believe that people should support the change by using their best efforts to make it a success <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate over empathy goes wider than the gcse which merely seeks to reflect different approaches to history and not to dictate them <e> <s> empathy has not been introduced into history by the gcse it is an approach that has been developed by some teachers over quite a few years <e> <s> those seeking to damn all gcse history because of disagreement with the approach of a particular syllabus should examine the full range of syllabuses <e> <s> freedom of choice of syllabuses exists to cater for different views <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the interim report that we have received from hmi is reassuring <e> <s> it informed us that the introduction of the gcse is already leading to better teaching and learning in many schools <e> <s> that must be my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is an important and increasing problem <e> <s> we are in contact with the department of trade and industry <e> <s> the national curriculum will ensure that all pupils study a broad and balanced curriculum to the age of which is the pattern of our european neighbours <e> <s> that should help as regards the problems of transition <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an existing problem <e> <s> we are looking at ways of ensuring that the situation is improved <e> <s> to that end the government support the role of european schools and the role of british independent schools abroad <e> <s> there is a variety of local education authority provision to meet the needs of parents abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords the objectives of the national curriculum are not designed to fit in precisely with the international baccalaureate <e> <s> however the government believe that the introduction of the curriculum will help pupils <e> <s> its broad and balanced nature in addition to the series of tests and attainment targets and the system of testing will tie in better as do the gcse examinations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that british-type schools provide a valuable service for british citizens working abroad <e> <s> for that reason we welcome the efforts of cobisec a body representing the interests of independent schools mainly situated within the european community <e> <s> in addition the ministry of defence makes special financial arrangements for the children of service personnel <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we are looking at the problem in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords in many circumstances it is extremely well handled and well met by private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if my reply gave cause for confusion <e> <s> my intention was to say that the national curriculum should make it easier to comply with the requirements of the international baccalaureate <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> all interested parties will be consulted and listened to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords without proper research we can only guess the figure and i believe that my noble friend lady young in answering the question of the noble baroness in made it clear that the precise information was not available at the time <e> <s> that was the reason for my previous replies

produce the precise information would involve a manual search of the confidential personal files of each official and that would cost a disproportionate amount since only authorised senior officials could make the search <e> <s> in this country we have a great tradition of a career civil service and on that i rest my case <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> we have a wealth of experience of teaching in various institutions in her majestys inspectorate indeed most of the officials in the grades referred to have been in the civil service for many years and their abilities experience and training as civil servants are of the highest order <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting that we duplicate the work of local authorities <e> <s> after all it is the local authorities which administer and will continue to administer the education service at the grass roots <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier my case rests on the fact that we have in this country a great tradition of career civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason to suggest that the information is or should be kept secret it is simply not available at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys inspectorate is indeed independent <e> <s> however we benefit in the department from its valuable advice <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a separate question <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that hmis are in close contact with schools and very much aware of remarks such as that which the noble lord has just expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords that may indeed be a problem <e> <s> however such people will have the benefit of advice from a small unit which is being set up in the department to assist them <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand by my original answer <e> <s> the information is not presently available <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals put forward by my noble friend are two of the possibilities that are under consideration <e> <s> we certainly recognise the concern expressed about the need for satisfactory long-term financial arrangements and we hope that a final announcement will be possible soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no reason to believe that this has been suggested or indeed that it would be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give no final assurances in this respect but i can emphasise that we recognise the importance of the collections and in particular the ethnographical collections at the horniman <e> <s> the museums provide a substantial service in the south-east particularly to schools and colleges and we are actively looking for ways to safeguard this service and to preserve the funding <e>", "<cs> my lords before a final decision is made that must always be a possibility <e> <s> however at the moment it seems unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all conscious of the weight of our mailbags these days <e> <s> however i can do no more than assure the noble baroness that the announcement will be made as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i said that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and as i said those possibilities are under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so <e> <s> i shall certainly raise the point with my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> in fact my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science announced in another place in november last year that he intended before the end of to review the criteria for the approval of courses which were set out in des circular / and to consider what the future arrangements should be for the review and approval of courses of initial teacher training <e> <s> this will take into account both the hmi reports <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that it will encourage a number of new entrants <e> <s> the government are doing a great deal in connection with encouraging mature students to enter teacher training <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is the policy of this government always to try to improve upon the best <e> <s> certainly so far as concerns accreditation the then secretary of state my noble friend lord joseph set up the council for the accreditation of teacher education in to advise the holder of his office on whether individual courses met the criteria which were set out in the des circular to which i have referred <e> <s> some of these criteria are designed to eradicate the deficiencies which were noted in the first hmi report <e> <s> so we are seeking to improve the situation the whole time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are a number of good things which go on in the education system which are predominant <e> <s> it is the minority of difficult cases which always attracts publicity <e> <s> certainly it is that minority of cases which the government are dealing with in the committee of inquiry into discipline in schools which has recently been set up <e>", "<cs> my lords in preparing development plans for education each inner london council will be required to list the property it wishes to take over to carry out its education responsibilities <e> <s> this will include sports facilities used by the schools and colleges in its area <e> <s> draft guidance on development plans was published earlier this week and sent to the boroughs <e> <s> it explains the proposed arrangements for sports facilities which are used by more than one borough and also gives any other interested party the opportunity to contribute to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we have consistently emphasised that we are willing to discuss the future of services in inner london with anyone with a special interest <e> <s> this will include the sports council the national playing fields association and other similar bodies <e> <s> we are happy to include anybody with such an interest in sports facilities <e> <s> no disposal of the land can be made without the agreement of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the processes are intended to establish these areas for sporting facilities <e> <s> if there is no take-up from inner london boroughs outer london boroughs or any other interested party other suitable use for the land may be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the intensity of use of the facilities will be one of the important considerations <e>", "<cs> this particular debate may not have been going on quite since but it has been going on for a very long time <e> <s> nevertheless it has been long and stimulating and quite rightly so because the national curriculum stands at the heart of the governments proposals and has indeed been widely welcomed not least in this chamber during second reading as the means by which standards can be improved overall low expectations raised good teachers confirmed in their practices and parents more easily involved in what their children are doing in school every day <e>", "<cs> this subject is important and it merits our attention <e> <s> it is of course a relatively easy matter for the government of the day to testify to the importance they attach to religious education <e> <s> successive governments of both political parties have made such commitments since the act came into effect <e> <s> but we have also seen over those years a steady decline of the subject in schools with relatively little done from the centre to correct matters <e> <s> we are now seeing in this bill a turning of the tide with a practical demonstration of the governments commitment to the effective provision <e>", "<cs> if the amendments are within the grouping then i take it that my noble friend has already spoken to them and will simply move the amendments when we come to them in due course <e> <s> however if my noble friend wishes to add something now i shall be happy to hear what she has to say <e>", "<cs> all the amendments to which we are speaking relate to the need for the national curriculum to meet the individual needs of all pupils in maintained schools some of whom will have very special needs but all of whom will be different from each other in their patterns of abilities aptitudes and enthusiasms <e> <s> i understand the concerns that have been expressed and welcome the opportunity to discuss them further <e> <s> however i am not wholly convinced that all these amendments are necessary to secure that such needs are met <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness can take that phrase as positively as she has interpreted it <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps that those cases are not included in the group of amendments dealing with special needs which we are discussing at this point <e> <s> but i should like to stress that the arrangements for the implementation of the national curriculum are intended to take account of the fact that certain schools and perhaps certain individual children may wish to specialise in some way <e> <s> that is why the arguments i put forward earlier about the means of implementing the provisions of the national curriculum i believe allow for those possibilities <e>", "<cs> i spoke against amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> no doubt my noble friend will speak to that amendment when we come to it <e> <s> perhaps i may make it clear that i intend to move the government amendments when we come to them <e> <s> i assume that there will be no objection to that course <e>", "<cs> by bringing forward the amendment the noble lord has gone a long way towards making what is implicit explicit <e> <s> the growing tendency to make declaratory statements on the face of the bill is to be deplored <e> <s> therefore i stand by the comments i made at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to establish in law the professional rights of teachers <e> <s> i believe as does the noble baroness lady seear that the teachers professional role must be safeguarded <e> <s> the importance of the teachers role has been fully recognised as has been emphasised by my noble friend lady young <e> <s> i am not convinced that the amendments are necessary or workable <e>", "<cs> the three amendments of the noble baroness lady david are somewhat ambiguous <e> <s> in the context of attainment targets the word individual could mean either single or related to each particular child <e> <s> the former interpretation would add nothing to the meaning so i take it that the noble baroness intends by these amendments to ensure that attainment targets and assessment arrangements are individually described to suit the personal needs of each child being assessed <e> <s> clearly such an objective is not quite practicable <e>", "<cs> the group of amendments deals with two related points <e> <s> dealing with consultation first clauses and already require the secretary of state to consult the ncc as respects england and the secretary of state for wales to consult the ccw before making orders covering attainment targets and programmes of study and certain other matters <e> <s> wide consultation is also to be conducted in england by the national curriculum council which is to report the results to the secretary of state <e> <s> it is only after this that my right honourable friend may draw up a draft order <e> <s> he then has to consult on that draft order with all interested bodies <e> <s> only in the case of orders about assessment arrangements is there no requirement for consultation but those orders will flow from the proposals for each subject on which there will have been consultation and would be of a technical and administrative nature <e> <s> the assessment tasks themselves will have been piloted in schools <e>", "<cs> the government have always made clear as regards the implementation of the national curriculum that they would lay emphasis on the core subjects first and then follow them with the various subjects which form the foundation part of the curriculum <e> <s> the government are already doing work in terms of shortage subjects which affect mathematics and science teaching <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord can be assured that everything is being done to ensure that the mathematics part of the core curriculum has a suitable supply of teachers well before <e>", "<cs> i was trying to give a positive answer to the noble lords negative question by saying that we intend to ensure that the maths teachers will be there <e>", "<cs> i should like to clarify what i said <e> <s> we expect all primary schools to teach all the core and other foundation subjects as appropriate to their pupils for a reasonable time from september but not necessarily in line with attainment targets and programmes of study which may not have been worked out by then by the relevant task groups <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern expressed about the possible nature and effects of the national assessment arrangements which we intend to introduce in association with the national curriculum <e> <s> however i believe that the governments actions so far show that concern to be unfounded <e> <s> we are now familiar with the fact that the task group on assessment and testing was established last year to advise on arrangements for a national assessment system <e> <s> the group brought to bear on the subject an impressive weight of educational expertise <e> <s> it produced a report which has been widely welcomed not least by the government as being both sound and innovative in education terms <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot give any guarantees but i hope so <e>", "<cs> it is not the governments intention to create league tables in any event <e> <s> however the inclusion of paper and pencil tests as part of the arrangements was supported by the task group because it has a value in certain contexts <e> <s> however it is not to be the only basis on which children are assessed and tested and certainly not at the first stage of seven years <e>", "<cs> i can only agree to differ <e> <s> my understanding was that the task group said that paper and pencil tests had their place <e>", "<cs> these are important concerns and we have been extremely fortunate in the variety of views expressed in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> i find myself able to agree with many of the sentiments expressed in the course of this debate <e> <s> however i fear that the conclusions i reach are rather different <e> <s> i am confirmed in my view that it is in the best interests of all pupils to study a full range of subjects up to the age of but to add subjects of the students own choice particularly in years and of secondary school <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must stand by the fact that we think that the subject is adequately covered by the provisions in the bill <e>", "<cs> we return with these amendments to a fundamental challenge to our national curriculum proposals <e> <s> there are two central reasons why i ask the committee to reject the idea of a national curriculum consisting of core subjects only <e> <s> the first and most important is that such a national curriculum would not serve the purposes of a true national curriculum as set out in <e>", "<cs> i understand that and i believe that to be part of the problem because the exhortation did not work <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may not be arguing against a broad curriculum but what he is arguing for is the means of dispensing with the methods of ensuring that broad curriculum <e> <s> i answer his query by saying that what we are doing with the subjects which are enumerated as foundation subjects is building on those best practices in many of our schools to which a number of your lordships have referred <e> <s> it has been frequently said in the course of this debate that many of our schools already deliver the national curriculum <e> <s> it is in building upon best practices that we have seen the way forward with this bill and its proposals <e> <s> that is how we have found our subjects <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i recognise that the committee wishes to include in the list of foundation subjects important topics such as personal and social education and life skills <e> <s> as i said then this is an area where the government have already identified a need for coverage within the national curriculum and have taken steps to ensure that it has a role to play in the curriculum <e>", "<cs> good and fair testing and assessment will be essential for the successful implementation of the national curriculum <e> <s> as the noble lord lord glenamara and other noble lords have pointed out good teachers and good schools already carry out regular testing and assessment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher made some supportive remarks about the advantages of early testing and assessment or about assessment at any rate it is essential for effective teaching <e> <s> i should like to emphasise as a general remark that what we intend with this bill is to build on best practices and thereby ensure that good teaching and higher expectations apply to all and not just to some lucky children <e>", "<cs> the proper expression is that the children will be formatively assessed so that teachers can find out what stage they have reached <e> <s> if a particular problem is shown there may be scope or need for subsequent diagnostic testing <e> <s> i think i have made it clear or at least i thought i had made it clear both this afternoon and indeed on the first day of committee that the testing and assessment arrangements which have been recommended by the task group involve certainly at the age of seven mainly assessment processes <e>", "<cs> we debated the other day the question of the responsibility of teachers in all this and i have been at pains to point out that the method of implementing the national curriculum including the assessment processes and testing will be very much the responsibility of the teacher within the general criteria laid down by each individual working group on each individual subject <e> <s> however if i may say so before other noble lords spring to their feet i am about to respond in more detail to some of the other questions which have been raised in the course of the debate <e> <s> i think what i have to say will meet at least some of the inquiries which have already been made <e> <s> therefore i should like to continue <e>", "<cs> i went into that matter in detail on tuesday but i recognise that all the members of the committee were not here for the whole debate <e> <s> summative testing shows the stage children have reached at a particular age formative testing as i understand it looks at the individual childs ability to reach target levels <e> <s> so in that sense it is slightly diagnostic <e> <s> at ages and the results of the assessment are made available as appropriate and we hope that the assessment will go on throughout a pupils education <e>", "<cs> the intention of the broad and balanced curriculum is that pupils should follow all foundation subjects to the age of <e> <s> for various reasons they will wish to follow them at different levels <e> <s> some will take the gcse <e> <s> for others there will be an alternative form of testing and assessment <e> <s> as i have already pointed out for the three nonacademic subjects music the arts and pe there willl not be scope for similar testing and assessment arrangements <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in the bill to prevent those practices being carried on <e>", "<cs> my intentions are honourable <e> <s> so far as it is possible to know them i know what they are and so do the government but in certain respects it is not possible to know them yet because we are still waiting for further reports and further decisions <e>", "<cs> in response to the last point made by my noble friend lady faithfull and the remarks of the noble baroness lady david it was never the governments intention to put this sort of detail into the bill <e> <s> it is a framework bill <e> <s> nevertheless the provisions relating to each separate subject in the national curriculum will come before parliament <e> <s> they will be subject to a consultation process and there will be scope for people to make their views known at that stage <e>", "<cs> i believe that this has been an extremely useful debate <e> <s> of course we shall take note of what has been said but i have tried to explain that the arrangements which will be brought forward make it unnecessary to add to the size of the bill and to add the amendments which are being proposed to the weight of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> my understanding was that the amendment had been debated earlier with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure my noble friend the duke of norfolk that the ethos and character of voluntary-aided schools and in particular of catholic schools about which he spoke so eloquently are safe under the national curriculum proposals <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord peston for raising this issue since it enables me to explain the ways in which the secretary of states <e>", "<cs> we believe that because the secretary of state is obliged to take advice from the national curriculum council before making orders and the processes for the ncc involve wide consultation only if he disagrees with that advice should it be necessary to have a procedure of this kind <e>", "<cs> as we have heard amendments nos <e> <s> and are alternatives <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would require all national curriculum orders to be subject to affirmative resolution procedure while amendment no <e> <s> would only extend that requirement to orders in which the secretary of state failed to give effect to the advice of his advisory bodies <e>", "<cs> the noble lord would leave the duty and power to define assessment arrangements with the secretary of state but give to local education authorities the power to specify attainment targets and programmes of study <e> <s> local education authorities will have a new strategic role as a result of the bill <e> <s> i was at pains to point that out at second reading <e> <s> however this amendment appears to be a recipe for disaster <e> <s> we do not want an assessment-led curriculum with local education authorities reduced to inventing alternative ways of meeting centrally-set assessments <e> <s> we want assessment arrangements which serve the objectives of the national curriculum to flow naturally from the agreed targets and help to chart pupils progress in a consistent and useful way <e>", "<cs> the provisions of the subsection as it now stands refer to testing and assessment arrangements at all ages <e> <s> targets are to be related to <e>", "<cs> we have a long way to go this afternoon and i do not wish to spend too much time on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i may sum it up by saying that as i understand it the noble lord wants a local curriculum that is nationally assessed which would not meet the point raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the national curriculum will set out nationally-agreed targets and the broad framework of programmes of study <e> <s> there will be considerable freedom for teachers and local education authorities as at present to tailor specific educational provisions to pupils needs <e> <s> i believe that that meets the case <e>", "<cs> we have indeed already touched upon this subject today <e> <s> the task group recommended that at the last key stage age there should be no immediate change to gcse to fit the national assessment arrangements but that the gcse criterion syllabuses would in due course be revised as appropriate to incorporate the -plus attainment targets and programmes of study <e> <s> the nature of the revisions required would only become clear following the development and implementation of the national curriculum and assessment at the younger ages <e> <s> the task group also considered that when a pupil was not studying a subject to gcse level he or she could be assessed against less demanding attainment targets <e> <s> so they will indeed be separate <e>", "<cs> we discussed this matter in some detail during debate on the national curriculum at the beginning of the week <e> <s> it may reassure the noble baroness if i say that the gcse is and will remain central to our plans for raising standards in schools <e> <s> we intend the gcse to form the basis of assessing most pupils against national curriculum attainment targets at age but the foundation subjects of the <e>", "<cs> the amendment relates to consultation on orders made under clause <e> <s> on all orders establishing or amending attainment targets and programmes of study consultation is already required in a way which goes well beyond that contained in clauses and of the bill <e> <s> we have been referring to the task group on assessment and testing and indeed the task group did not deal with the question of consultation on the specific assessment and testing arrangements and instruments to be adopted under the new system <e> <s> but we do not consider it necessary to provide for statutory consultation on orders establishing assessment arrangements for the foundation subjects for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is not entirely clear <e> <s> where formal consultation is required obviously consultation will be requested <e> <s> otherwise it is open for anybody to come forward and to contribute <e>", "<cs> this amendment would make each of the five independent gcse examining groups a designated body empowered to give statutory approval to qualifications and syllabuses <e> <s> the intention presumably is to enable each examining group to approve its own qualifications and syllabuses <e> <s> but this would completely undermine the objective of national quality control of independent scrutiny and approval <e> <s> this national oversight of the system is a key element of the existing voluntary arrangements under the secondary examinations council and it forms an essential basis for the statutory arangements now envisaged <e> <s> the five gcse examining groups in england and wales bring experience of gce and cse examinng and longstanding reputations for high standards <e> <s> but it is nevertheless essential to have an independent guarantee of the standards across those five separate groups from a national perspective <e> <s> the current voluntary arrangements do not provide that guarantee <e> <s> that is why these provisions are in the bill <e>", "<cs> the case for effective national approval is supported by experience <e> <s> under the o-level and cse the examining boards approved over syllabuses for use in schools <e> <s> with gcse they have currently produced many fewer just under but the number is growing <e> <s> the gcse examining groups were directly responsible for approving some of these the mode and syllabuses <e> <s> sec has now scrutinised nearly half of the approved by the groups and so far i understand has found only that come up to standard <e> <s> that evidence i submit points sharply to the need for effective national approval with teeth <e>",

baroness for intervening <e> <s> my mderstanding is that in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> she would also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> clause is intended to provide essential underpinning for the national curriculum <e> <s> it is widely recognised that school examinations exert a powerful influence over the curriculum <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to have a statutory

possible basis for the assessment of pupils achievements at the age of <e> <s> nevertheless there is no intention that the clause should create a harmful straitjacket or enforced monopoly <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can give my noble friend the assurances for which she has asked and i do not believe i need to add anything further to the remarks i made on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> we debated the whole subject of the number of amendments under this heading and the general response was that this is a subject that we believe to be important that it should be dealt with in the normal school curriculum as a cross-curricular theme if necessary but that there should be room otherwise to deal with it in the amount of time which is available for specific subject areas <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord thorneycroft has indicated that these are probing amendments <e> <s> we have had considerable debate on this subject so i feel that it is not necessary for me to add to what has been said by the right reverend prelate except to agree with him that this is a complicated and sensitive matter which needs carefully looking at <e>", "<cs> to clarify the position i believe that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am sorry to have to tell the noble lord lord dormand that the harmony which exists between us in our views on the role of teachers cannot extend to those amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to increase the membership of the national curriculum council the school examinations and assessment council and the curriculum council for wales <e> <s> membership would be increased from between and members to between and members <e>", "<cs> the government are not unsympathetic to the thoughts which lie behind the amendment of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i am somewhat persuaded by some of the arguments that have been advanced this evening <e> <s> if the noble baroness will permit me i should like to take this matter back without commitment and perhaps deal with it at another stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to confirm that in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> we are speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i understand that there is considerable concern in this respect <e> <s> as my noble friend lady young pointed out earlier the provision that councils should include persons with relevant knowledge or experience of education means that there is a sufficient basis on which to build councils which are in all respects aware of the problems they face and are competent to deal with them <e> <s> i include in that the practical problems and opportunities of the classroom and the considerations which must apply to children with special needs <e> <s> nevertheless because of the concern which has been expressed and in taking back the previous amendments which relate to the composition of these councils i must include this one i shall take the amendment back again without commitment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ritchie for drawing our attention through his amendment to an important aspect of the framework established by the bill <e> <s> clause makes it encumbent on the secretary of state on local education authorities and on the heads and governors of maintained schools to exercise their respective functions so as to secure that the curriculum provided for pupils is balanced and broadly based <e> <s> this is a fundamental principle of the bill <e> <s> the functions of the curriculum councils as set out in clause are to keep all aspects of the curriculum under review to advise and assist the secretary of state and to make information available to all who are concerned with the provision of education and with the curriculum <e>", "<cs> at this stage i regret that i am not able to add anything to what i said on the previous occasion <e>", "<cs> the amendments proposed by the noble baroness lady david to the functions of the curriculum councils seek to give the councils a significantly greater degree of formal freedom than we intend <e> <s> the responsibility for promoting and developing the national curriculum properly rests with the secretary of state the leas and the schools <e> <s> the work of the councils is to provide support and advice in this important endeavour <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his advice <e> <s> i emphasise that curriculum development is the primary focus of and reason for the kind of research and development that the councils can undertake <e> <s> to return to the point raised by the noble lord lord hylton and the link with clause the work of the curriculum development councils requires the fitting together of specific national curriculum requirements in particular schools so that it can be carried out more fully <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to add to the functions of the national curriculum council and the curriculum council for wales so that they take account of regional considerations <e> <s> i ought to point out first of all that the curriculum councils do not actually have the job of determining the content or the format of the national curriculum <e> <s> they are <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to embark upon another semantic discussion but in terms of wales the point is that welsh is a foundation subject there and is a core subject in welsh medium schools <e> <s> clause refers to the core and other foundation subjects <e> <s> it may be helpful to the noble baroness to say that the distinction is that the core subjects are part of the foundation subjects but they have a slightly different emphasis in that they are the subjects which we believe to be at the heart of the whole curriculum <e> <s> they are therefore the first subjects to be introduced and they are subjects which will be compulsory throughout primary and secondary schooling <e> <s> so there is some distinction but they are part of the foundation curriculum as well as of the national curriculum <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get into a long and involved discussion at this point <e> <s> foundation subjects are to be continued until but for example we are not expecting a foreign language to be started at the beginning of primary school <e>", "<cs> clause deals with the duty to establish the national curriculum by order <e> <s> that refers to the way in which the secretary of state should make the orders <e> <s> but for further clarification i believe i can refer the noble lord to clause <e>", "<cs> i confirm that the orders under clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the heading has given offence <e> <s> i reassure my noble friend lord swinton that i do not feel that my back is bleeding <e> <s> i understand very well the reason for the noble baronesss suspicion of the power in schedules and <e> <s> that power is not intended to be used to discriminate against people who may become disabled in some way while holding office <e> <s> only if the disability were so severe that they were plainly unable to continue would the secretary of state seek to remove them and the schedules provide for that <e> <s> i agree that the power is unnecessary and we accept the amendment <e> <s> we shall also be prepared to accept an amendment removing the identical provision in schedule <e>", "<cs> i have nothing to add to the comments which i made in the previous debate <e>", "<cs> clause of this bill has perhaps been one of the most controversial clauses because i believe that this has been one of the least understood elements of our national curriculum provisions <e> <s> clause does not regulate the scope for all curriculum development and experimentation in future <e> <s> the great majority of this work will continue as now in schools and local education authorities in colleges and university departments of education to look at alternative ways of meeting commonly agreed broad curriculum objectives <e> <s> the only difference will be that increasingly in future these commonly agreed broad objectives will take the shape of national curriculum attainment targets <e>", "<cs> like the previous amendment the amendment from the noble lord lord graham would also extend the scope of the secretary of states powers to cover disapplication of the national curriculum in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> the national curriculum provisions of the bill would not be legally enforceable upon a school which was unable because of unforeseen circumstances to meet its obligations and for this reason the amendment is also an unnecessary addition to the clause <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> requires the secretary of state to act reasonably but that is already a general principle underlying all the provisions of the bill and of all legislation <e> <s> if any secretary of state were to exercise his powers unreasonably he would be open to legal challenge <e> <s> if we were to write in the requirement to be reasonable <e>", "<cs> i said that the general principle underlying all legislation as well as the provisions of the bill is that the secretary of state in the circumstances should act reasonably <e>", "<cs> the government have made clear that they do not wish the national curriculum to be a static one set in stone <e> <s> it must be capable of responding to changes of need and circumstance and to the development of knowledge over time <e> <s> that is why clause requires the secretary of state to revise the national curriculum when he judges it expedient to do so and why clause requires the ncc to keep the school curriculum under review <e>", "<cs> within the framework of attainment targets and programmes of study there will be scope for experimentation without having to make specific application under this clause <e> <s> therefore i do not anticipate that there will be an enormous increase in the workload in this respect <e>", "<cs> i think that is what we are doing now

that the foreign office at present has no plans to build on that site <e>", "<cs> my lords the second question asked by the noble lord goes rather beyond the original question on the order paper <e> <s> if he cares to table a question on that point i shall be most happy to try to answer it <e> <s> certainly there are some deficiencies in the present residence <e> <s> its lease is coming up for renewal <e> <s> foreign office policy is to replace leased accommodation overseas with owned properties whenever it is cost-effective to do so and when the building has all the advantages required by security <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords i shall make sure that when the overseas estate department representative visits madagascar later this year he is aware of my noble friends thoughts on the matter <e> <s> i can confirm that one of the problems about the present residence is the poorly arranged circulation between public and private areas of the house <e> <s> there are also other features which render it perhaps not as suitable as it might be as an ambassadorial residence <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the governments interests to ensure that the commissioners submissions are dealt with promptly <e> <s> the bill provides for the commissioners submissions to be approved by her majesty in council <e> <s> her majesty will be advised in the normal way by the privy council <e> <s> this will involve consideration of the commissioners submission by officials in both the privy council office and the department of education and science neither of which foresees any difficulty in the extra work being handled by existing staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is any intention to revive the universities committee to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> it is expected that the commissioners will be chaired by a senior retired judge and will include a specialist lawyer with knowledge of university law <e> <s> their supporting staff will include a lawyer <e> <s> their draft modifications should therefore require a minimum of consideration by officials <e> <s> they will need to examine the statutes of about institutions over a period of three years or just over one a week <e> <s> that should not be too onerous a task for the department of education and science or indeed for the privy council office to handle <e>", "<cs> the clause describes the detailed checks and balances which will apply to the exercise of the powers of any secretary of state to establish and amend the components of the national curriculum <e> <s> the checks are in addition to parliamentary scrutiny which is secured by the provisions of clause <e> <s> clause also secures <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can assure the noble baroness that there is no oversight in this case <e> <s> our main reasons for deciding not to consult on orders establishing assessment arrangements were rehearsed in the response to amendment no <e> <s> last week but i will briefly recap <e> <s> in the first place the main aspects of assessment which i would regard as controversial its existence at all the age points at which it should generally be applied and the establishment of seac as the body charged with securing the quality control in this area are all being debated on this the primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i recognise the special interest of my noble friend in this matter <e> <s> i believe that i can give an assurance that suppliers will be made aware in good time <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the effectiveness of assessment arrangements is something that the seac will be able to comment upon as it will be responsible for monitoring the overall progress <e> <s> the major function of the school examinations and assessment council is its role to approve gcse syllabuses as the sec does now <e> <s> this is provided for under clause <e> <s> i believe that to be hardly a negligible function <e>", "<cs> it is the assessment arrangements for the national curriculum assessment proposals together with the assessment which is already covered by the schools information regulations on school-leaving arrangements <e>", "<cs> i must speak against amendment no <e> <s> a as proposed by the noble baroness because it is very wide in its scope <e> <s> it takes us beyond topics which are the subject of this chapter and indeed of the bill as a whole <e>", "<cs> the amendment picks up one aspect of the matter that we discussed on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> the case for extending the complaints machinery to clause and to other curriculum provisions is one that we have agreed to consider further <e> <s> on that basis i trust that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> we make no claims that the policy embodied in clauses to of the bill represents a radical departure from the <e>", "<cs> i have explained in response to the previous amendment why the government do not consider it proper to allow local education authorities and governors to fix a maximum admissions limit below a schools standard number <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ritchie has explained amendments nos <e> <s> and would enable governors to fix a maximum limit to take account of curricular factors <e> <s> if a school admits more pupils as a result of the implementation of more open enrolment the local authority will have to take account of those increased numbers in allocating resources to the schools and the schools budgets will have to be deployed so as best to support the delivery of the curriculum <e>", "<cs> the issue of community and adult education use of a schools facilities is important <e> <s> we are aware of the concerns and i feel sure that local authorities will keep this very much in mind <e>", "<cs> i recognise the argument of the noble baroness <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that she will accept my reassurance on this point <e>", "<cs> the government believe that the provision for more open enrolment will offer to all parents of whatever ethnic origin a better chance of having their preferences met and existing safeguards against illegal discrimination will continue to apply <e> <s> as now no schools will be able to refuse admission to a pupil on racial grounds <e> <s> nor will they be able to set criteria for admissions priorities in the event that there are more potential pupils than places available that discriminate between applicants on racial grounds <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add another word to what i previously said <e> <s> i understand that at present there are at least maintained schools in england whose pupils are all from an ethnic minority and about schools with per cent <e> <s> or more ethnic minority pupils <e> <s> a large number have per cent <e> <s> of ethnic minority pupils <e> <s> those developments are dictated largely by patterns of settlement <e> <s> there will be many reasons for parents choice of school <e> <s> convenience and geography will figure high <e> <s> schools will therefore continue to reflect that pattern <e> <s> segregation is no part of the bill and in not accepting the amendment we are merely underlining the fact that in giving parents choice in this matter we do not wish to circumscribe that choice in any way <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern that has prompted this amendment to safeguard the position of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream schools <e> <s> the government share this concern <e> <s> i have already mentioned in a different context the guidance which the department will be issuing to local education authorities and others after royal assent which will recommend a formula for calculating the physical capacity of secondary schools and which will make allowance for the space requirements of pupils with special educational needs <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to retain what it terms the orderly provision of education services across the area of an authority <e> <s> but it amounts to a rejection of the whole principle of more open enrolment that where parents want to send their children to a school they should be able to do so if the school has room <e> <s> if a school is popular with parents then in the governments view it should be allowed to admit pupils up to its real capacity <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i do not have the precise figures at this moment but i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> i believe that this policy will help local authorities by giving parents the choice <e> <s> it will underline which schools are the popular schools and those which because of falling school rolls have to be closed and which are the most suitable for closure <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving us the benefit of her knowledge in this matter <e> <s> i of course fully agree with her explanations <e> <s> if admission processes are set in train in good time it should be possible to plan the situation even taking into account the odd last minute arrival <e> <s> quite possibly the introduction of open enrolment will cause local authorities and indeed schools to revise their admission policies and to further promote them which should help <e>", "<cs> the government believe that existing temporary accommodation should count towards a schools physical capacity <e> <s> to disregard it would be to underestimate that capacity <e> <s> so amendment no <e> <s> would make matters worse <e> <s> it would not only appear to disregard temporary accommodation but would also allow admission authorities if they saw fit to set an admissions limit lower than the capacity of the schools permanent buildings <e>", "<cs> i understand that it is the overall capacity of the school and therefore all age groups which are involved in terms of establishing the standard number <e>", "<cs> there are procedures in the bill to enable schools and local authorities to revise standard numbers <e> <s> if that revision is agreed to and if it is reasonable to remove the temporary accommodation that will be taken into consideration <e> <s> if it proves unreasonable in the circumstances to remove the temporary accommodation it may be that the school will have to reinstate it <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have explained that there are procedures to revise the standard number <e> <s> it is not a case of sticking to the standard number through thick or thin <e> <s> the standard number equates to the number of pupils which a school can admit in the year or years when pupils are normally admitted <e> <s> however the departments guidance on the assessment of capacity will advise schools to look at their total capacity <e> <s> in the case of an to year-old school there would be a capacity for five age groups <e> <s> the admissions limit would then be calculated by dividing that total by five <e>", "<cs> i was somewhat mystified as to the purpose of the amendments <e> <s> if i have understood the noble lord correctly his general aim is to replace the standard number of schools as defined in clause by reference to section of the act with a later admission figure <e>", "<cs> clause already establishes that for the purposes of this chapter a schools capacity to accommodate pupils is changed if the premises regulations change or if there are changes in the availability or use of accommodation at the school <e>", "<cs> i regret at this stage of the proceedings it is a little difficult to be clear about that <e> <s> i said that a school that has a nursery class or unit on the premises makes appropriate accommodation available for that provision in accordance with the different space standards for such pupils <e> <s> the existence of that provision will be taken into account in determining the capacity of the school to accommodate other pupils <e> <s> it seems to me that accommodation is part of a standard number <e>", "<cs> i recognise the importance of nursery education and i believe that the guidance to be issued which will be helpful in so many areas will also be helpful in this area <e> <s> it is not the intention to push out existing nursery provision in schools where it has proved successful <e>", "<cs> there is nothing on the face of the bill to push out nursery classes and so nursery provision will remain <e>", "<cs> the question put by the noble baroness is similar in terms to that of the noble baroness lady seear which i have just answered by saying that there is nothing in the bill to push out nursery classes and therefore nursery classes will remain <e>", "<cs> the government fully recognise the vital importance of the head teacher and indeed other senior staff being fully involved in the decisions of the governing body under a scheme of financial delegation <e> <s> that partnership will be the cornerstone of any successful scheme <e> <s> but the partnership must be based on trust <e> <s> the act already provides for head teachers to be members of the governing body except where they choose not to be <e> <s> we expect that increasingly head teachers will exercise their right to be members <e> <s> even where they do not the school government regulations give a head teacher who is not a member of the governing body the right to attend any of its meetings <e> <s> so heads will be fully involved with the decisions of the governors <e> <s> this existing framework offers as good a guarantee that the partnership will work as it is possible to provide through legislation <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i should have thought that a head teacher who is a member of the board of governors of a school would be aware of all that is going on to the extent that he or she desires <e> <s> nevertheless i agree to look further at these amendments to ensure that all the concerns of my noble friends are covered <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify the position <e> <s> my noble friends concerns are covered in the bill as it stands but i undertake to look at the matter again to ensure that that is so <e>", "<cs> the government support the general intention behind the amendment <e> <s> however we believe that its aims are adequately provided for in existing legislation <e> <s> by seeking to enforce the curriculum through schemes of delegation the amendment risks upsetting the balance which the existing provisions were intended to create <e>", "<cs> we believe that these amendments flow naturally from the principle of financial delegation as my noble friend lady young said <e> <s> in making these appointments governors must have regard to a number of factors in deciding on the appointment and what grade to give to the post <e> <s> like everyone else the governors will be obliged to act in accordance with general law and in particular with the law on sex discrimination <e> <s> in response to the noble baroness lady seear the contract of employment for non-teaching staff as for teaching staff will be with the local authority which is the employer <e>", "<cs> paragraph of schedule sets out the arrangements which apply when a head teacher or deputy head teacher is to be appointed <e> <s> these arrangements require that the governing body shall notify the lea of the vacancy in writing before taking any steps and that before recommending any person for appointment the governing body must advertise the vacancy in publications circulating throughout england and wales <e>", "<cs> i can only say to that that any employer who runs a small business and has to employ someone must be in the most dreadful difficulties <e>", "<cs> i have already explained that the chief education officer of the local education authority is entitled to attend for the purpose of giving advice as regards the proceedings of the governing body <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the questionnaire was sent to local authorities with a deadline of february but we have only recently received some responses <e> <s> some local education authorities or per cent <e> <s> replied to the questionnaire and the results show that there were deaf-blind children for whom those local education authorities had responsibility <e> <s> that represents about one in of the total school population in england <e> <s> i have no doubt that some of the information collected in the questionnaires will be part of the statement to be published in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the concern and the need for training in this area <e> <s> at present there are no training courses specifically for teachers of double-handicapped deaf-blind children <e> <s> i understand that the university of birmingham with the help of a grant from the leverhulme trust is developing teacher training in this area <e> <s> but generally speaking it is a post qualification in-service training course that is appropriate in such cases <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> one of the problems in this area has been a lack of information hence the need for the questionnaire and the gathering of information <e> <s> department officials have met representatives of sense on a number of occasions and most recently in the last month <e> <s> they have made very helpful contributions to our consideration and we shall be keeping in close touch with them <e> <s> we are most grateful for the role that they have played <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the statement will be to deal with the children who have the double handicap of being both deaf and blind <e> <s> this is a complex subject and will involve to some extent the consideration of speech therapy <e>", "<cs> my lords all the provisions of the education act are in force <e> <s> the act lays upon local education authorities certain duties in respect of provision for children with special educational needs <e> <s> it is for local education authorities to determine their own priorities for the level of resources to be made available for the purposes of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the warnock report estimated that it would take until the end of the century for all its recommendations to be fully implemented <e> <s> all local education authorities are now operating the procedures introduced by the act <e> <s> prior to the act base lines for special education provision varied significantly among local eduction authorities <e> <s> some of the variation persists as some local authorities push ahead at different rates with reviews of their provisions <e> <s> however all are doing something <e> <s> some are doing more than others <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not believe that the provisions of the new bill diminish the effects of the act in any way <e> <s> it is intended that all children including those with special education needs will benefit from the provisions of the bill <e> <s> much is already being done in this area in respect of teachers and teacher training <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not agree with the conclusions of the noble lord <e> <s> the governments plans for local authority spending on education for announced last november represent a cash increase of per cent <e> <s> over the plans <e> <s> that is in addition to the substantial increase of per cent <e> <s> for the previous year <e> <s> the plans for special education in are per cent <e> <s> higher than the plans <e> <s> that increase should help local education authorities to pursue their policy priorities for special education <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that problems have emerged in local authorities in certain areas <e> <s> of course they are being kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement relating to the previous question standing in the name of the noble viscount will be issued fairly soon though i cannot give a date <e> <s> it relates specifically to double-handicapped children <e> <s> however the department will be undertaking a review of the act later this year <e> <s> that will take into account the outcome of research projects the advice of hmi together with the findings of last years report of the house of commons select committee on education science and the arts on children with special education needs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness and her friends have made sure that we are fully aware of this particular area as it is affected by the education reform bill <e> <s> we are still in the process of considering the comments and concerns that have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the importance of teachers in this area my mother was a teacher in a special school <e> <s> much has been done <e> <s> the government have established national priorities with funding at per cent <e> <s> grant level for in-service training in order to meet the special education needs of children with learning difficulties in schools <e> <s> priority areas include teachers of children with disabilities of sight or hearing or with severe learning difficulties designated teachers within ordinary schools and the training of education psychologists <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the act was largely based on the warnock report hence my reference to the comments in the report <e> <s> the department intends to conduct a review during which consultation with a number of interested parties and organisations will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords we have said on many occasions that the education reform bill is a framework bill <e> <s> these considerations will be taken fully into account in the implementation of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the review will take these factors into consideration <e> <s> it would not be proper for me to pre-empt the conclusions of that review <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> universities are after all autonomous institutions and it is not axiomatic that all their costs should be met by the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords all universities have some items of expenditure which could be regarded as out of the ordinary but the ugc is prepared on current practice to make a special factor allowance but only in the most exceptional circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that has already been considered and no doubt it will be an element in the review <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the distinction but the question on the order paper focuses especially on the financing of university libraries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments and for his invitation <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and i believe that the matter was discussed on another occasion <e> <s> we are aware of the factors attaching to the sale of books in the rylands collection <e> <s> i should like to reiterate the fact that the sales were of second copies of books in that collection <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the bequest made an express provision that books may be sold exchanged or otherwise disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that contribution <e> <s> it is a point that we should all bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the government considered carefully the option of allowing special schools maintained by local educational authorities to be eligible to apply for grant-maintained status <e> <s> however we concluded that such a step would be inappropriate for several reasons <e> <s> first the prime objective of our proposals for grant-maintained schools is to increase the scope for parental choice yet it often happens that the special school is the only one of its particular character for a very large area <e> <s> i have to say to the noble baroness that in this case i do not believe that greater parental choice would be the likely outcome <e>", "<cs> the government are committed to raising educational standards and enhancing parental choice <e> <s> grant-maintained schools offer a <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken once and so i shall be very brief <e> <s> some parents will be satisfied by the greater vitality and responsiveness that will result from our reforms of local authority schools <e> <s> however if some governors and parents want to go further and take complete responsibility for running their own schools we believe that they should be free to do so <e> <s> true choice should not simply be the privilege of the rich who can afford to pay fees <e> <s> parents should not have to accept second best within a local authority monopoly of free education <e> <s> if parents are perfectly happy with the service offered by their local authority they will see no need to assume the burden themselves <e> <s> the existence of an alternative should itself help to raise standards in all authorities and schools <e>", "<cs> both of them <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the concern of the bishops of the roman catholic church to maintain the unity of catholic educational provision as has been expressed this evening <e> <s> i also realise that in expressing their concern the bishops are not setting their faces against the concept of grant-maintained status and that they acknowledge that in some circumstances it may be right for their schools <e>", "<cs> to reiterate there is nothing to stop the governors from informing parents when asking for their name and address that they have the right not to have those details disclosed to other parents <e> <s> that may be a sensible precaution for the school itself <e> <s> however the governing body will need to satisfy itself that the parent is asking for the list for good reason <e> <s> if it is not so satisfied then it is open to that body not to supply the list <e> <s> i can reassure the noble lord that i shall look further at that point <e>", "<cs> i shall try to reassure the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i believe that i should have already achieved that <e> <s> schools that become grant-maintained will continue with their existing catchment areas so there is no change on that front <e> <s> the property continues in the ownership of the trustees so there is no change on that front <e> <s> the only change is that the source of finance will come from central government instead of from the local authority <e> <s> the trustees always have the power in that they have the right to appoint a majority of the foundation governors <e> <s> therefore i believe that there is no need for the sort of anxieties that have been expressed <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the grouping is of amendments nos <e> <s> a za and zb <e>", "<cs> to take first the point of the noble lord lord morton of shuna on amendment no <e> <s> ca if the time limit has served satisfactorily for the purpose of section of the act i see no reason why it should not do so in this case <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i do not follow the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have this further opportunity to make it clear that it is the governments firm intention that the introduction of grant-maintained schools should not prejudice the integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream schools <e> <s> as it stands the legislation includes a number of safeguards to ensure that children with special educational needs will continue to be admitted to schools which become grant-maintained <e>", "<cs> i understood that the grouping in this matter had been agreed <e> <s> if it is not too difficult for my noble friend i think we should be happy to have the whole discussion together <e> <s> then he can of course move the amendment separately when the time comes <e>", "<cs> certainly if my noble friend feels that then we are content <e>", "<cs> i of course appreciate the significance of these amendments and the government have recognised the concerns many noble lords have expressed during the debates we have already had concerning religious education in schools <e> <s> i have therefore noted very carefully the views that have been put forward about religious education in grant-maintained schools and collective worship generally <e> <s> i have to say however that i do not think it would be appropriate to take decisions on these matters now <e>", "<cs> in view of the many declarations which have been made this evening i should like to start by saying that i too am a practising christian and feel most strongly about my faith <e> <s> i should be disappointed if my noble friends felt that they had to press the issue to a vote now <e> <s> i was glad to hear from my noble friend lady cox that that may not be the case <e> <s> i can only repeat the governments advice that they should support the line advocated by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e> <s> as my noble friend lord sandford has reminded us the right reverend prelate has agreed that the word christian could and should appear on the face of the bill <e> <s> the difficulty is how that should be done <e> <s> he has given the committee an assurance that he will come back with a solution <e>", "<cs> this is an important topic on which many of us hold strong views <e> <s> we have now discussed the substance on three different occasions and there is not a great deal that i can add to what i have said previously on all these amendments <e> <s> i believe that the right time to return to a substantive debate will be on report <e>", "<cs> i can assure my noble friend that we shall be looking at this provision in the light of the whole package <e>", "<cs> the government had believed that the matter was adequately covered <e> <s> clause permits the secretary of state to request whatever information he considers necessary in relation to any building work which would be required to implement proposals for a significant change of character or enlargement of a grant-maintained school if those proposals are approved <e> <s> the particulars which the secretary of state will require should be sufficient to enable him to ensure that the buildings will meet the necessary constructional standards including where appropriate those in design note <e>", "<cs> i regret that i cannot give the noble baroness a clear answer on that matter at this moment <e> <s> perhaps i may write to her <e>", "<cs> i understand the concerns which have led my noble friend to seek to make these changes to the composition of school governing bodies <e> <s> he is concerned that they may prove to be unwieldly there may be difficulty in recruiting enough people to act as governors and that in the case of teachers there may be inappropriate conflicts of interest inherent in their membership of school governing bodies <e>", "<cs> the purpose of many of the proposals in the bill is to introduce an element of competition into the education system particularly into the maintained sector with grant-maintained schools <e> <s> i see no reason why there should be any problem in a grant-maintained school and a ctc existing in a similar area <e> <s> they offer different opportunities and i believe that they will be both welcomed by parents <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord young of dartington has spoken very persuasively in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is an argument i remember well from second reading <e> <s> the opportunity to attend small schools is already available to children living in many rural areas <e> <s> indeed in areas of sparse population small schools are sometimes the only schools available for children within reasonable travelling distance of their homes and it is obviously right that where such schools are educationally viable they should continue to operate <e>", "<cs> yes i take the point of the noble lord <e> <s> but we feel that a newly established foundation school of the kind that he is advocating would not enjoy the sort of support structure which would provide that broad and balanced curriculum <e> <s> if pupil numbers and teacher numbers in that school fell there would be no means of ensuring that pupils received a sufficiently broad curriculum <e>", "<cs> the government do not underestimate the seriousness of the truancy problem <e> <s> we fully understand the concerns which underlie the amendment <e> <s> at present the responsibility for taking action on truancy rests with local education authorities <e> <s> it is for them to decide on a policy for their area and it is for schools themselves in association with the leas education welfare service to pursue individual cases of unjustified absence <e> <s> there is an important distinction to be drawn between absence from school which may be for entirely valid reasons and truancy <e> <s> truancy is usually defined as unauthorised absence without parents knowledge or consent but the term can also be used to embrace absence which is unjustified from the viewpoint of the school or lea but condoned by the parents <e> <s> such problems of definition make it very difficult to identify levels of truancy within the overall incidence of non-attendance <e>", "<cs> of course we believe that music is important <e> <s> that is precisely why music is part of the national curriculum <e> <s> however these amendments would prevent schools from charging for individual music tuition <e> <s> in introducing the amendment the noble baroness lady birk said that the bill would introduce charges for music lessons for the first time <e> <s> that is not correct <e> <s> music lessons have always been seen as an optional extra to the mainstream curriculum and local education authorities have been free to charge <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by reassuring this committee of the governments commitment to music as an integral part of the learning process and of each childs artistic and aesthetic development <e> <s> we are indeed strengthening musics position in school life by making it part of the national curriculum <e> <s> all children will now have to study music throughout the years of compulsory schooling <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is perfectly clear and that there is no need for an amendment <e> <s> however i shall consider this to make absolutely sure of that point and take any action if it is necessary <e>", "<cs> i said amendment no <e> <s> zd <e>", "<cs> i have not but i have entirely lost my place <e> <s> i was saying that as a result of the consultations that have been carried out the government have taken careful account of the views in drafting the new clause <e> <s> they have endeavoured to balance the legitimate concerns of those affected by a transfer of powers with the need to ensure that the transfer is genuine and credible <e> <s> the interests of parents staff and other interests specific to the school and adjacent schools have been taken into account <e>", "<cs> yes it will be possible to experiment and to seek new ways of doing things <e> <s> since the government are satisfied that the safeguards included are adequate to ensure that governing bodies consider all the relevant factors and consult and inform concerned interests before initiating any changes i believe that these clauses will open up new possibilities <e>", "<cs> since worries have been expressed that the strategic planning role proposed for local education authorities might constrain the ability of colleges to respond to the changing needs of students and employers i am happy to give an assurance that that is certainly not the governments intention <e> <s> nor we believe will it be the effect of our proposals <e> <s> on the contrary a key purpose of delegation is to give colleges greater freedom of manoeuvre <e> <s> the government have all along emphasised the importance of strategic planning by local education authorities of the fe provision in their areas <e> <s> in the absence of such planning there is likely to be unnecessary duplication of provision in some subject areas and lack of provision in others <e>", "<cs> we think that the idea is already covered and for that reason we do not think that the amendment would add anything to what is contained in this section of the bill <e>", "<cs> in general i would say that the detail of these issues is discussed in the guidance which the department issued on st april <e> <s> a number of queries might well be answered by that <e> <s> the guidance shows that we have sought to achieve the right balance in what is admittedly a difficult area <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lady that it was my intention to listen to any arguments that might be advanced and to look again at these amendments <e>", "<cs> this is a complicated issue <e> <s> the need to define the boundary line in the bill arises from the repeal of the old provisions in the act on further education schemes <e> <s> those provided a means of deciding at any given place whether an institution was a school or a further education establishment <e> <s> in effect fe was defined as being the provision set out in the local education authoritys fe scheme <e>", "<cs> i believe that the two colleges to which the noble baroness referred were new college swindon and alton college in hampshire <e> <s> those colleges are classified as fe colleges and they have the pattern of provision typical of a sixth form college <e> <s> since we need a clear boundary line between the secondary and the fe sectors there is always a chance that wherever the line is drawn some college will fall on the wrong side <e> <s> the two colleges concerned have fallen on the wrong side <e> <s> it would be relatively simple for the colleges concerned to bring themselves within the requirements of classification as a college simply by increasing the proportion of part-time or post- work <e>", "<cs> we believe that sixth form colleges and further education colleges have distinctive characteristics and that it is right that those characteristics should be preserved <e> <s> if we allow too much blurring of the boundaries local people who have been consulted on the creation of schools and colleges will have no assurance about their future character <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston has said with all such matters there is an evolution and it may be that in future the need for such distinctive characteristics disappears <e> <s> we do not believe that that time has arrived <e>", "<cs> we also believe very much in the importance of part-time education and training particularly for this age group <e> <s> if it would help the noble baroness i shall be happy to write to her explaining the government proposals more fully if i have done so inadequately <e> <s> we are doing an enormous amount in the bill and also outside the bill to encourage work in this area and to emphasise the importance of part-time education and training <e> <s> i do not see that the amendments proposed would help in any way <e>", "<cs> the proposed new clause seems to have two main purposes <e> <s> firstly it provides a philosophical exposition of the place and purpose of higher education and second it places a duty on the secretary of state to secure the provision of efficient higher education to meet the needs of the people of england and wales <e>", "<cs> we believe that in the arrangements made in the bill we are establishing some new and revised structures in order to deliver higher education more efficiently and to a wider group of people <e> <s> we believe that to be the essential aim of the bill <e> <s> i can certainly confirm that we are sympathetic to the aims but do not feel it appropriate to state them in this way on the face of the bill <e> <s> there are many way in which one can widen access and improve the means of ensuring that people enjoy <e>", "<cs> these amendments do not increase or decrease the powers of higher education corporations <e> <s> they are essentially intended to clarify and simplify the provisions in the bill <e> <s> as yet we have not issued any draft guidance on this matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will be helpful to the committee if i intervene at this stage <e> <s> my noble friend the lord privy seal will speak at the end of the debate on this group of amendments <e> <s> he will then respond to many specific points which have been raised in the course of our discussions <e> <s> however i believe that it will be useful at this point for me to remind the committee of some of the background to the governments proposals and say something about their implications and what action has been taken <e> <s> i hope that that will go some way towards meeting the appeal made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark and the points raised by the noble lords lord kilmarnock and lord annan <e>", "<cs> the government as a listening government listened to the many comments on this subject that were made <e>", "<cs> all the procedures would be delayed and slowed down <e> <s> everything would grind to a halt <e> <s> it is very difficult to estimate such factors at this moment of time <e> <s> however we believe that the need to settle the doubts and uncertainties that have arisen in inner london perhaps in particular with teachers means that there is an urgency about this case and that it is important that we get on with the job <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady david has explained why she believes that these amendments provide an element of local decision about the structure of inner londons education service <e> <s> it would not of course allow free local choice about the way in which education was to be run and in that respect it differs from the proposals which the government originally introduced into parliament <e>", "<cs> we recognise the importance of further and adult education and i have already acknowledged the high quality of much of the ilea provision <e> <s> indeed i go so far as to say in a general way and not just with reference to ilea that adult and continuing education has an increasingly important role to play as my noble friend lady young said <e> <s> indeed the widening of access to which the noble baroness lady blackstone referred is supported by the government <e>", "<cs> i shall try to answer one or two of the additional questions which have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston asked whether the subject of adult and continuing education has been discussed with the conservative boroughs <e> <s> i should remind him that the guidance which has been issued which refers to adult and continuing education and its importance in the development plan has been issued to all boroughs <e> <s> further it has certainly been discussed with the leaders of those boroughs which have been prepared to come forward and discuss their plans with us <e> <s> i refer the noble lord to the leaflet issued by wandsworth council which has a section headed adult education which refers to various details on the matter <e>", "<cs> from memory i believe that the act <e>", "<cs> it is a suggestion that has been put forward and obviously there are people who many well be willing to pay such additional fees to those institutions <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> as i understand it as well as the property matters to which the noble lord referred these amendments are largely concerned with the extent to which the lrb will take account of education interests in discharging its functions in relation to ilea and the transfer of education responsibilities in inner london generally <e>", "<cs> i had rather assumed that the noble lord lord kilmarnock was tabling these amendments as probing amendments <e> <s> i therefore hope that i shall be able to reassure the committee on the point that they raise <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble baronesss concern over the future of the residential schools for children with special educational needs maintained by the ilea <e> <s> there are of them of which lie outside the ilea boundary either in the outer london boroughs or counties in the south-east of england <e>", "<cs> as i said guidance was distributed some three weeks ago to a very wide variety of people <e> <s> i expect that the staff will certainly be aware of what is said in that and can go some way in being able to reassure the parents <e> <s> as regards the establishment of the working group i am not sure but i think that it was announced by my noble friend this afternoon and therefore people might not be aware of it <e>", "<cs> i shall try to meet one point as well as the general points that the noble lord lord carter has raised <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment addresses specifically the cases of the residential schools <e> <s> that is why i confined my remarks to that factor <e> <s> we have considered the general provision for special educational needs and the cost element to which the noble lord has drawn our attention is not really a problem because the cost follows the child <e> <s> the recoupment takes place at full cost <e> <s> even if the example he quoted for wandsworth were to exist where only a small number of local children were in the school for children coming from other areas the full cost would be met in a similar way to what happens in other parts of the country <e> <s> i do not foresee any major change or problem in that respect <e>", "<cs> because we have requested the boroughs to address this concern in the development plans they are to bring forward we shall be looking closely at those plans to ensure that the provision is adequate <e> <s> in terms of any other support as i said these arrangements are made in other parts of the country and therefore i see no reason why london boroughs provided that they go about it the right way should not be perfectly capable of and responsible for handling these needs <e>", "<cs> i accept that in moving this amendment the noble lord was not moving it as a probing amendment <e> <s> i also recognise that in tabling these amendments in any event he is taking a most constructive approach which i very much welcome <e> <s> i believe that the amendments contain a good deal more detail than is either necessary or appropriate for primary legislation but they nonetheless deal with important questions which we have addressed in our draft guidance on the preparation of development plans which we shall want to discuss in more detail with the inner london boroughs during the coming two years <e>", "<cs> i said that these would be administrative and support services <e> <s> it is largely in the administrative services that we expect to see possibilities for savings <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assure the noble baroness that there is nothing sinister in the words discussion with ilea as appropriate <e> <s> we intend to involve the ilea fully in all aspects of the transfer of functions and hope for its full and effective cooperation as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> as i understand it in addition to moving that amendment the noble lord was also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> dza and eza <e>", "<cs> the flexibility to designate schools outside a boroughs area is designed to cover two specific cases <e> <s> first ilea maintains a number of schools completely outside the inner london area and this is a matter that we have already discussed most of them catering for children with special education needs <e> <s> we do not wish to preclude those schools from being transferred to one of the <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord was concerned about the possibility of flexibility in this case <e> <s> in preparing their development plans under clause councils will be required to specify all schools inside their area which are currently maintained by ilea and therefore to anticipate the kind of example that the noble lord has given us <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure the noble lord <e> <s> clause follows the model of the arrangements established at the time of the abolition of the glc which provided for deemed borrowing by successor authorities <e> <s> the purpose of that was twofold to provide for the smooth transfer of outstanding liabilities and to protect third parties who were owed money at the time of abolition <e> <s> we expect the detailed operation to follow the model of the act also <e>", "<cs> the government are well aware of the valuable service provided by the horniman and geffrye museums to the people particularly the children of london and the south-east as my noble friend lord st john reminded us <e> <s> we have said all along that we are anxious to preserve that service <e> <s> we believe that we have now found a satisfactory way of ensuring their future indeed of providing for both museums to improve their standing and service in the community <e> <s> i am therefore most grateful for the welcome extended from all sides of the committee to our proposals <e>", "<cs> the government have on many occasions paid tribute to the high quality of ileas provision for the musically gifted and in particular the centre for young musicians based at pimlico school and the london schools symphony orchestra <e> <s> these have a deservedly high reputation <e> <s> i know that members of the committee share the governments view that such opportunities for high level music tuition and performance should continue to be available <e> <s> under our proposals the inner london boroughs will each become responsible for music tuition generally in their area as are the outer london boroughs and other local education authorities <e> <s> but we readily accept that there need to be co-ordinated arrangements for provision of a more advanced nature since the high standards presently achieved depend upon a large number of <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that between us my noble friend the lord privy seal and i had already explained adequately the proposals of the government for securing the future of these four important institutions <e> <s> i am glad that in principle the noble baroness and the noble lord lord mcintosh are able to welcome our proposals so wholeheartedly because we believe that these proposals will also encourage a policy of flexible development so that the service provided continues to meet the needs of its customers <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the concerns of my noble friend in this matter <e> <s> under the governments proposals the inner london boroughs will assume responsibility for youth service provision in their areas after the abolition of ilea <e> <s> they will have to set out how they intend to fulfil this responsibility in their development plans <e> <s> we shall not seek to constrain the boroughs by imposing prior conditions about the type and level of provision they must make <e> <s> they must take their own decisions based on the particular needs of their area <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the debate and the views which have been expressed <e> <s> i should like to make clear to the committee both the aims of the amendment and its impact <e> <s> the aim has been stated with fervour and sincere feeling by the proposers of the amendment <e> <s> it is to ensure that non-education provision in the statement of special educational needs has the same status as educational provision <e> <s> non-educational provision includes not only speech therapy occupational therapy and physiotherapy but also other services provided by district health authorities social services departments and voluntary organisations <e> <s> these services may include equipment care respite care and counselling <e> <s> as a consequence of the amendment leas would be under a duty to make all such non-educational provision or to be answerable to parents through appeal committees if they failed to do so <e> <s> the impact of the amendment would therefore be to place leas under a duty to make non-educational provision which it is not their province to provide <e>", "<cs> i can give that assurance <e> <s> in fact in doing that i believe that we shall perhaps be in the position we thought we were in before the <e>", "<cs> it is a little difficult for me to give a firm commitment on that point at this stage but obviously i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> schedule sets out the details of the structure and operation of the two funding councils for higher education and the education assets board <e> <s> for simplicity we have drawn together the common factors in each case into one schedule to govern all three corporations <e>", "<cs> if there is life after the guillotine i shall do my best to clarify the situation <e> <s> clause to which the first amendment of the noble baroness refers is a purely technical change to existing grant-making powers intended to put beyond doubt the power of the secretary of state to give grants to such bodies as the royal society and the british academy <e> <s> since the noble baroness asked me specifically what amounts are currently given i can tell her that in the year the british academy is due for million and in the same year the royal society is due to have million <e> <s> future levels are yet to be decided <e>", "<cs> i was surprised by the latter amendment <e> <s> it would provide a far wider grant-making power which we certainly do not seek <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> it is not part of the intention of the clause that the power should be used to fund grant-maintained schools or higher education institutions directly rather than through funding councils or anything else <e>", "<cs> it appears that the enforcement of the provisions by weights and measures authorities was discussed with representatives of the local authority associations <e> <s> there is no specific provision for additional costs but we believe that the local authority associations felt that these were suitable bodies as they will be appropriately trained and equipped to cope with the problems <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will accept that i will write to him to clarify this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for the informative way in which she introduced the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government are sympathetic to the idea of a code but we believe that it should be non-statutory <e> <s> this is a sensitive area and the issues raised are best dealt with in non-statutory guidelines <e> <s> the commission for racial equality already has power which it has not used to issue a non-statutory code and the government would encourage it now to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the time factor perhaps i may write to the right reverend prelate on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the university has decided to fill the regius chair of greek in <e> <s> in the case of the chair of modern history the university has given a higher priority to filling two other prestigious chairs in history <e> <s> i understand that at oxford there are a total of chairs in history of which three are vacant <e> <s> of these one is being filled one has been advertised and the third has been left vacant for the time being <e> <s> we believe that universities need to bring their income and expenditure into line in ways which are academically sound <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must reply by saying that it is right that decisions concerning priorities within a university are for the university itself to take <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state wants to encourage many more talented people with relevant qualifications and experience to become teachers <e> <s> he proposes therefore to change the regulations on the granting of qualified teacher status for those who have not trained in england or wales <e> <s> these regulations have long been in need of reform <e> <s> under my right honourable friends proposals no one will be granted qualified teacher status until he or she has received any necessary training and their professional competence has been fully tested <e> <s> the existing arrangements do not provide such a safeguard <e>", "<cs> my lords the training arrangements will vary according to the needs of the teacher concerned <e> <s> some overseas-trained teachers may require very little additional training whereas an untrained person with no previous teaching experience would clearly need more extensive training <e> <s> on the whole that will be the responsibility of local education authorities <e> <s> in due course the department will make available guidance on appropriate training for licensed teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords in the sense that the regulations provide nothing new the arrangements will follow current practice <e> <s> the regulations will enable the government to clarify the situation <e> <s> already we have about per cent <e> <s> of teachers who enter under the routes which are described in the consultation document <e> <s> the consultation document clarifies the entry arrangements <e> <s> it will not make an enormous difference to the follow-up training that is required <e>", "<cs> my lords the costs of training will be eligible for support under the local education authority training grant scheme and the grant-maintained schools grant <e> <s> as i said guidance on monitoring will be issued after the responses to the consultation document in which monitoring is referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal in the consultation document is that qualified teacher status will be granted on the recommendation of the local authority or school governing body after the licensed teacher has taught satisfactorily during a period of no fewer than two years and no more than three years <e> <s> during that period a licensed teacher with no or insufficient pre-entry training would have had to undertake a training programme tailored to his or her needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> a number of people have already warmly welcomed the proposals and more will do so when they have considered the consultation document <e> <s> we hope and expect that the new arrangements will attract more people to teaching <e> <s> indeed the work of the teaching as a career unit has shown that many older people are attracted to teaching but are put off by the pre-service training requirement and the lack of clarity in the present arrangements for granting qualified teacher status on the basis of experience <e> <s> we hope that the proposed arrangements will also help to attract more candidates from the ethnic minorities who perhaps possess overseas teaching qualifications <e> <s> that must be to the benefit of the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said and as i said previously we expect this scheme to attract many new entrants <e>", "<cs> my lords i can probably say yes to the second part of the supplementary question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> the arrangements for the training of licensed teachers will he subject to the same kind of central supervision as all other teacher training <e>", "<cs> my lords no change will be necessary to the regulations which govern teachers salaries <e> <s> during the period of licensed teaching special arrangements will apply <e> <s> obviously after qualified teacher status has been acquired the normal provisions of the teachers pay and conditions document will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> that is one of the most important aspects of teaching <e> <s> by presenting these regulations as proposals at this stage the government hope very much to attract to the profession people with that particular indefinable quality <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are funding a major programme for the dissemination of these materials to teacher training institutions <e> <s> in particular each institution will receive a free set of materials <e>", "<cs> my lords initially all industrial and commercial perspective materials arc to be distributed in the widest possible way to initial teacher training institutions <e> <s> the means of dissemination will include conferences workshops for tutors consultancy services and the publication of project materials and their free distribution to teacher training institutions <e> <s> we hope to widen the spread of distribution as much as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall attempt to respond briefly to the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> as regards the national curriculum our intention is to allow certain specialisation in the fourth and fifth year <e> <s> although it is intended that the full national curriculum should be followed through to school-leaving age it can be followed through at different rates of progress and to a different standard <e> <s> not all subjects are expected to be taken at gcse level for example <e> <s> in any event we anticipate that a substantial amount of the curriculum time approximately per cent <e> <s> will enable pupils who wish to specialise in a certain direction to do so <e> <s> i believe that it is fully compatible with what the noble lord seeks to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that the principle of a national curriculum has now been approved more than once by the house <e> <s> i am not persuaded that our use of a list of subjects in clause betokens a very different approach to the curriculum from that adopted by the scottish education department <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not wish to respond too often in this way <e> <s> i took my noble friends remark to be somewhat rhetorical <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord denham has made it clear that the amendments of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london must be accepted or rejected as a package <e> <s> i must make it clear that the amendments tabled in my name also represent part of that package <e> <s> without them the right reverend prelates amendments will not work in the way he has described to your lordships <e> <s> my amendments cross-refer to his and vice-versa <e> <s> having said that i should go on to say that the government welcome and fully endorse the amendments tabled by the right reverend prelate on both collective worship and religious education in maintained schools <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the worship referred to is the same <e> <s> it is perhaps to some extent historical that it is referred to differently on different occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking to the group of amendments which are listed with agreement <e> <s> i understood the noble lord lord sefton of garston to make reference to his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house my understanding is that the provision for withdrawal from religious worship is contained in government amendment no <e> <s> and that the existing rights of parents in this respect are preserved <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the anxieties of the noble lord lord carter in proposing the amendment <e> <s> i am only sorry that he did not find my response adequate at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the amendment of the noble lord in the course of my contribution to the general discussion <e> <s> i cannot recommend to the house that his amendment be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to all that has been said <e> <s> i recognise the concerns which have been expressed about what the government have consistently acknowledged to be an important area of the curriculum home economics personal and social education life skills and so on <e> <s> however i must dispute what the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee suggests that the response to previous amendments was negative and that he expects a similar response here <e> <s> i believe that we have been very positive and clear in explaining how in what is a framework bill we believe that these important topics are capable of being covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only reconfirming what i said previously in that all subjects in the national curriculum will not necessarily be taken up to the same standard that is to say to the gcse standard <e> <s> under the testing and assessment arrangements that we shall be discussing later there are various levels of attainment which allow for certain flexibility in planning the timetable <e> <s> having said that and given all the circumstances i trust that my noble friend and movers of the other amendments will not feel it necessary to press them <e> <s> if they do i must urge your lordships to reject them <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i said that it is possible that this matter might come up in terms of a recommendation to working groups on various curriculum subjects in connection with the criteria that are to be given to them <e> <s> it is quite possible that it will come up in guidance from the department subsequently <e>", "<cs> my lords the three amendments tabled by the noble lord lord peston seek to introduce into the bill a declaration that the framework established by the national curriculum will be broad enough to leave teachers with the freedom to interpret the curriculum to suit the needs of individual pupils <e> <s> as the noble lord has said the government are committed to the maintenance of that freedom <e> <s> the dedication and professionalism of the individual teacher are crucial to any education policy <e> <s> and it is essential that teachers should continue to be able to operate within locally and nationally defined policies as professionals allowed to make their own judgments about the needs of pupils and how best to meet them <e> <s> but i believe that there is no need to amend the bill in this way in order to achieve those objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise why my noble friends have felt it important to move their amendments in spite of the earlier extensive debate and indeed the unanimous agreement to the amendments of the right reverend prelate and the government <e> <s> i am grateful to them for the spirit in which they have moved them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady birk said we had a short discussion on a similar amendment during the committee stage <e> <s> i believe i then said that i was glad the noble baroness felt able to welcome the inclusion of music and art in the list of foundation subjects <e> <s> i hasten again to reassure your lordships that the government attach importance to the arts in schools and we certainly do not intend our proposals to have <e>", "<cs> my lords yes in so far as art and music are specifically stated as foundation subjects <e> <s> however as i have attempted to assure the house on a number of occasions there will be time outside the national curriculum subjects for other subjects <e> <s> in any event physical education will be one of the foundation subjects as well and there is scope in that for dance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the terms art and music are sufficiently wide to cover the various points that have been made in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the danger of going for the arts as opposed to what we have gone for is what the noble baroness lady birk referred to as a sampling of many things an arts mish-mash with no real knowledge or expertise necessarily developed <e> <s> we have said that pupils should have exposure to music and attempt to develop appreciation if not skills <e> <s> we believe that dance and drama will be present throughout the curriculum in the ways i have attempted to suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity afforded by these amendments to consider again the place of foreign languages in the national curriculum <e> <s> i welcome even more the elegant way in which they were introduced by the noble lord lord mcnair and the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> as it stands the bill requires a modern foreign language to be taught as a foundation subject at secondary level <e> <s> we feel that this is important for the future needs of our children as well as for our future in the european community and indeed to meet the point made by the noble earl lord russell about travel needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lords who moved this amendment may be jumping the gun a little <e> <s> the bill does not specify which modern foreign languages may qualify as a foundation subject <e> <s> these are to be specified in an order to be made by the secretary of state under clause b subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> it would of course be possible for noble lords to pray against the clause b order if they thought that the wrong languages were being specified or that the list was unduly restrictive <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the list of foreign languages which will be issued in the order will i believe be susceptible to regional variations and it will be a very comprehensive list <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house what i said was that we were not yet in a position to say which category of languages will be included <e> <s> we shall consult on this and accept advice <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in response to the last two questions i said in my remarks that i could not prejudge what the result of consultation would be <e> <s> i also said that no modern foreign language was ruled out <e>", "<cs> my lords we are faced in these amendments with a number of issues many of which were dealt with in committee <e> <s> before turning to the detailed amendments i should like to respond to a point made by the noble baroness lady blackstone in introducing them <e> <s> she asked why the governments proposals for the national curriculum in england and wales will be established in a different way from scotland <e> <s> the process of creating a common curriculum in scotland has been continuing for a number of years and considerable progress has been achieved there <e> <s> it is therefore possible for the governments policy on the school curriculum to build on what exists and on the activities of its existing curriculum and examinations council <e> <s> progress in england and wales has been neither as fast nor as well developed as in scotland <e> <s> therefore the governments proposals for the national curriculum set out to achieve the more rapid progress now required if all the children in the country are to have the opportunity to benefit as fully as possible from their years in compulsory education and with the benefit of a broad and balanced curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that addressed the subject of maths and science teachers in particular <e> <s> of course in terms of the national curriculum there will also be particular needs in terms of language teachers and possibly others <e> <s> the government are certainly addressing those needs but i believe that my general remarks about the decline of the pupil population over the foreseeable period applies in general to this and to the fact that there will be scope for redeployment and in-service training of teachers to meet the needs <e> <s> we are certainly regarding this matter seriously <e> <s> nobody is suggesting that it is a perfect picture but we are working hard on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern expressed by the noble lord lord ritchie and others over the definition of core and other foundation subjects <e> <s> we have considered the points raised in the earlier debates and indeed the points raised as a result of the amendment before us today about the need for such clarification but we remain of the view that the bill as drafted allows only one interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of any confusion in this respect until an apparent confusion arose in this house on a previous occasion <e> <s> therefore i do not think that it is widely creating a problem <e> <s> further i believe that my statement today must have helped to clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> suggest to the house that since many of the considerations involved apply also to the following amendment no <e> <s> this should be taken into account <e> <s> both amendments seek to ensure that the national assessment system associated with the national curriculum follows the key recommendations of the report of the task group on assessment and testing <e> <s> in fact the principles which should govern the national assessment system were clearly stated by the secretary of state in the parliamentary answer he gave on th june when he published the supplementary reports which he had received from tgat <e> <s> those of you who have read his statement will know that the principles now adopted by the government reflect all the elements which tgat regarded as essential to such a system <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sorry if i have misled the noble baroness in that respect <e> <s> of course there will be certain children with mental handicaps who are totally exempted from the provisions of the national curriculum but there are others with a lesser disability who will be fitted into one of the levels <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if i am correct the noble baroness asked whether in the light of what she said the government could accept the amendment <e> <s> my answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank my noble friend lord elton for his kind-hearted intervention since it gives me the opportunity to say that the burden that i carry such as it is is shared by the officials who support me <e> <s> i wish these remarks to be conveyed to them <e> <s> nevertheless i shall attempt to answer the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to lay upon the secretary of state the duty to ensure that no orders issued to define the national curriculum conflict with the demands that may be made upon a pupil by tvei <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this point was raised yesterday in the course of the debate <e> <s> if the noble baroness is speaking specifically about the school-leaving age of i said then that we anticipated that the core subjects would be followed in most cases to gcse level the other foundation subjects would not necessarily all be taken to that level but would be to various levels of attainment within the spectrum permitted under the tgat arrangements so that it would be possible for additional flexibility to be built in in the fourth and fifth years <e> <s> i believe that this covers the point on tvei that was raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct that impression <e> <s> grant-maintained schools will not be independent schools <e> <s> they will still he part of the maintained sector <e> <s> funding will simply come from central government rather than local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the last remark of my noble friend lady young and emphasise what she said about the careful consideration that has been given in this matter and the intention that there should be no conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peston for introducing the amendment and also for the fact that we have his indirect support for the broad and balanced approach to the national curriculum <e> <s> that applies also to other noble lords who have contributed <e> <s> in saying that what he wants is a statement from the government as to their intentions the noble lord will not be disappointed <e> <s> we do not believe that the amendment is necessary because in making orders under clause we shall need to take account of many things <e> <s> however we do not intend to specify them all now <e>", "<cs> my lords the introduction of records of achievement for all pupils in secondary education is already government policy <e> <s> we have set the objective of introducing by arrangements under which all school-leavers will have such records or profiles <e> <s> pilot work has been under way in nine schemes involving local education authorities throughout england and wales over the past three years and a national steering committee has been asked to report to the secretary of state this autumn <e> <s> it will offer draft national guidelines in the light of the experience gained in the pilot schemes under which all school-leavers will have records of achievement <e> <s> this report will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments intention in introducing the national curriculum is to ensure that as in other european countries all pupils are guaranteed a broad balanced education throughout their years of compulsory schooling <e> <s> the purpose of the assessment arrangements is to ensure that all aspects of that basic curriculum are being taught and studied to a reasonable standard <e> <s> that is the safeguard for the problem put forward by the noble earl lord russell <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord anticipated there is no need for either of the changes suggested in this amendment <e> <s> first there can be no question of the gcse being incompatible with the requirements of the national curriculum <e> <s> the latter will be a general requirement and no gcse syllabus would be approved by the seac if it was not compatible with the law <e> <s> there is also no question of our introducing the national curriculum in such a way as to change the rules for any pupil while he or she is in the middle of a gcse course <e> <s> there will be ample opportunity for gcse syllabuses to adapt before the formal requirements are introduced for the fourth key stage in any subject <e>", "<cs> my lords during our debates in committee i did indeed express sympathy with some aspects of this amendment <e> <s> however i must point out to the proposers that as it stands the amendment is technically defective in that it refers to assessment orders which as we have discussed are not to be subject to parliaments approval <e> <s> the reference to judicial review is also inappropriate <e> <s> however the main point is that there should be adequate parliamentary scrutiny of orders establishing the attainment targets and programmes of study for the national curriculum <e> <s> i believe that to be the noble lords real concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the proposed amendments to clause because they are directed at giving parents more influence <e> <s> however i also understand that these amendments have been prompted by a specific case which regrettably arose at a particular school <e> <s> i recognise the genuine concerns that many noble lords have about this matter but i am sure that they will also agree with the noble earl lord baldwin <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must tell the noble lord that i am not privy to the headmasters reasoning <e> <s> therefore i am not able to tell him of his reasoning for refusing to permit the meeting to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that the review of the gcse will take place quickly <e>

discussion on this topic but what we are discussing now is amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i understand that my noble friend the chief whip when he made his statement yesterday said that any member of the house would be perfectly free to speak to his or her amendment when it came up in the order <e> <s> we are not now speaking to a grouping <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by confirming to my noble friend lord swinfen that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has the right to wind up at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most ready to admit to the noble lord lord hastings that both i and the department can and do make mistakes at times <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be given a remit to take into account the whole area of special educational needs <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be based on government policy and the implementation of the act <e> <s> we have already considered the composition of the council <e> <s> indeed i have assured the house that consideration will be given when making appointments to that body to people with the relevant expertise and in some cases personal experience of special educational needs <e> <s> and at the very least consultation will

be found in <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and would be exactly the same as the effect of those introduced by the noble lord lord diamond which he withdrew after i had explained why we do not think it necessary or helpful to have such large councils <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat that the government do not believe it would be helpful or efficient to have such large councils <e> <s> we believe that the provisions in the bill for the councils to be between and in number give adequate scope for the appointment of people with a wide range of background and experience while the bodies will remain small enough to take decisions and operate quickly and efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i had been able to persuade the noble baroness after the debate in committee that the secretary of state was prepared to listen to suggestions on the curriculum and assessment from organisations and individuals knowledgeable about education before making appointments <e> <s> indeed the names put forward by the noble baroness and others have been considered <e> <s> the appointments to the shadow bodies are not yet complete <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has underlined the problems of having representative interests on these councils namely that if every possible interest were represented the numbers could be unlimited <e> <s> in each case we envisage a relatively small compact group as widely drawn and as widely experienced as possible which will be able where necessary to co-opt specialist members appoint special advisory sub-committees and consult specialist interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that denomination in the act has always been interpreted as covering faith for example those of the jewish faith <e> <s> in one place we have specifically used the words christian denomination rather than religious denomination <e> <s> the distinction makes doubly clear that denomination is normally to be interpreted as including faith <e> <s> nevertheless i appreciate the concerns that have been expressed and we are certainly willing to look into the matter to be sure that it is completely clear and if necessary to clarify the position further <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not sure that i said that denomination was equal to faith <e> <s> i simply said that denomination has been interpreted as covering faith which i think is slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> we believe that they are completely contrary to the principles of financial delegation and local management of schools <e> <s> we see the problem to which the noble lord lord morton of shuna drew our attention as capable of resolution within the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness lady seear that we have considered the points which were raised and discussed during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords all teachers salaries will be subject to the national teachers pay and conditions regulations <e> <s> i do not envisage the problem raised by the noble baroness because as i understand <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of my noble friend as he has explained to us is that admission authorities should be able to fix an admissions number which would be up to less than the standard number of the school concerned without the need for any public procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments which suggest that factors other than the amount or use of school accommodation should be taken into account when admission numbers are determined <e>", "<cs> my lords i also understand the concern to safeguard the position of pupils with special educational needs that has prompted this amendment <e> <s> the government share the concern and have consistently made clear that such pupils will not be adversely affected by the new legislation <e> <s> decisions about the placement of pupils with special educational needs will continue to be made on the same basis as they are now <e> <s> pupils who are the subject of a statement under the education act are covered by the provisions of that act under which the educational placement considered most suitable for the child is named <e> <s> for those who are in the course of an assessment under section of the act the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house yes <e> <s> paragraph di of the financial delegation draft guidance covers that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the developments in community use of schools are much to be welcomed and the governments intentions are to safeguard and one hopes enhance this use of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern about nursery provision <e> <s> i hope that what i am about to say will appear more reassuring than what i said on the last occasion <e> <s> i can certainly confirm that the government recognise the value of nursery education <e> <s> we recognise it in a variety of ways one of which was referred to by my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house not really <e> <s> i hope that i may write to the noble lord on that particular issue <e>", "<cs> my lords where temporary accommodation forms parts of the existing physical capacity of a school it seems to us to be only right that it should be taken into account <e> <s> parents will presumably be aware of the type of accommodation available at the schools and no doubt it will be one of the considerations that they will take into account in deciding for themselves whether they want their child to go to that school <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lord lord peston nothing in this clause detracts from the governments continuing determination to ensure that public resources are used efficiently and effectively <e> <s> the reasons and the need for rationalisation at local level are not diminished <e> <s> local education authorities retain their duty to provide a sensible pattern of primary and secondary schools in their area <e> <s> i expect them to continue to submit to the secretary of state their proposals for securing this <e> <s> grant-maintained status will not be an easy or automatic escape route for a school in difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are as much opposed to racial discrimination as anyone else but this amendment does not we believe offer a helpful or indeed a practical way of tackling such discrimination <e> <s> perhaps i could try to explain how admission procedures operate <e> <s> parents may express a preference for any school that they would like their child to attend and give reasons for this preference <e> <s> i do not believe that the reason outlined by the noble lord lord stewart would carry any weight <e> <s> the local education authority or governors must then admit the child unless the school is considered to be full or unless the child is not eligible for admission to that particular school on grounds of age sex academic ability or religious affiliation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already touched on matters of redeployment and i shall endeavour not to cover previous ground <e> <s> schemes of financial delegation may provide for the safeguarded incentive allowances of redeployed teachers to be met outside a schools delegated budget <e> <s> we made that matter clear in the draft circular on financial delegation to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> that allows schemes to remove a potential disincentive for a governing body to take on a redeployed teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords before turning to the specific proposal made in the amendment moved by my noble friend that the secretary of state should commission a pilot study on the impact of delegation on governors time it may be helpful if i set out the current position on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords happily my noble friend is not in a unique position <e> <s> the government have made concessions on a number of occasions and have introduced amendments as a consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord trefgarne made clear in committee the government fully share my noble friend lord kinnoulls view of the increasingly important role that clerks will have to play in the future <e> <s> as governors take on more responsibilities they will place a premium on good advice about their statutory <e>", "<cs> my lords we went over this ground in committee to some extent <e> <s> however i take the opportunity to reiterate that the government see the training of governors as a vital part of delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords we touched on this theme in our earlier discussion <e> <s> as i made clear then and in committee the government fully support the aim of ensuring equal opportunities in schools both in relation to educational facilities and in relation to equality of employment opportunities <e> <s> these are two separate issues which with your lordships permission i will deal with in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as i understand it that particular responsibility will not be transferred to governors <e> <s> it remains with local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise my noble friends knowledge and experience in this area as i do that of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee <e> <s> but i had hoped that my noble friend lord trefgarne had made it sufficiently clear in committee that the government are fully committed to securing that the support services necessary for the effective delivery of education to pupils with special needs should be preserved under schemes of delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully accept that the selection of the head teacher of a school is a very important matter <e> <s> nothing is mote important to a school than the quality of the head <e> <s> the relationship between the head teacher and the governing body is crucial to the success of the school and will be even <e>", "<cs> my lords we did indeed and i am only too happy to notice that the noble lord is sufficiently alert to realise that we had responded to the concern expressed both by the noble lord lord irvine of lairg and the noble lord at a previous stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the house will accept that the reasons i gave while discussing amendment no <e> <s> earlier this evening are the same in respect of this amendment and therefore the explanation applies equally here <e>", "<cs> my lords no i have not <e>", "<cs> my lords we have discussed the matter during a debate on a previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that we shall draw her concern to the attention of those who are responsible for preparing the marshalled list more than that we cannot do <e>", "<cs> my lords there is common ground between the government and the noble baroness on this amendment that there will need to be close co-operation between local education authorities and governors of schools with financial delegation in operating the proposed arrangements for licensing <e> <s> after all if the local education authority is to make a persuasive recommendation to the secretary of state it will need to agree with the school governors on both the qualities of the teacher who is being recommended for a licence or in some cases for immediate qualified teachers status and the training he may require <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i shall certainly look at this without commitment before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> this is a situation where the proposals of the government are set out in a consultation document and are subject to that process <e> <s> i think there is little likelihood that we shall be able to introduce anything on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if it would clarify the slight confusion that appears to have arisen government amendment no <e> <s> which i have moved provides for the governors to decide upon the level of compensation paid to a member of staff in return for his agreement to resign <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b together with the paving amendment no <e> <s> a would require governors before deciding how much compensation to offer to seek and consider the advice of the chief education officer on two points <e> <s> i imagine that in most cases the member of staff would consult his union representative before agreeing to any compensation that was offered <e> <s> i emphasise however that there is no need to require a particular procedure for this consultation because we are dealing here with someone who is leaving school voluntarily <e> <s> when a governing body is contemplating a voluntary severance we would expect it to seek the advice of the chief education officer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree about the importance to our education system of voluntary schools in general especially church schools <e>", "<cs> my lords the next step will be further discussions with the interested parties <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords we must look at the history of the matter <e> <s> it was clearly right to introduce the teachers pay and conditions act <e> <s> the burnham machinery had broken down and something had to be done to sort out the mess <e> <s> as i have explained we are working towards a permanent machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the government are considering the ilo statement <e> <s> however the ilo itself has already recognised that we are working towards new machinery <e> <s> perhaps i may quote from a recommendation of the committee on freedom of association of the ilo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give my noble friend the detailed composition of <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said this is a matter which is subject to consultation <e> <s> to elaborate on the fact that there is a wide difference of opinion between the unions about the machinery that they would like to see perhaps i may explain that one union favours a pay review body and others want a national joint council one union wants special arrangements for heads and deputies and another union considers that there should be separate arrangements for primary and secondary teachers <e> <s> so there are a number of factors that will have to be dealt with in order to please all the interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said as a party to the ilo convention naturally we take into account its pronouncements <e> <s> that is what we intend to do in the context of the present teachers pay and conditions negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the government are considering what the ilo has said in this matter <e> <s> the ilo has recognised that we are working towards new machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that some of the parents of children attending feeder primary schools will take an interest in the possibility of a neighbouring secondary school becoming grant-maintained <e> <s> however i see no merit in imposing on the governing body of that school the duty to consult those parents as this amendment requires <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have consistently made it clear that they are unwilling to accept an amendment of this kind <e> <s> the objectives of establishing grant-maintained status as the noble lord lord peston said are definitely to improve our education system <e> <s> the intention is to offer more choice and competition in the maintained sector <e> <s> any mechanism to opt out might encourage initial applications for grant-maintained status to be undertaken rather too lightly offering as it would the possibility of a change of heart if running the school proved a little too challenging <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that what has been made clear by the secretary of state as regards the procedures for the closure and then if necessary the re-opening of a school may meet the case raised by the noble baroness and others <e> <s> it is in this respect that he has referred to a period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment raises two important issues <e> <s> first as has been explained the amendment would require no more than one vote to be cast in respect of each pupil <e> <s> the number of votes cast would relate to the number of children attending the school and not to the number of parents <e> <s> as we agreed in committee we have thought further about the proposition but i must report that we still do not consider it acceptable <e> <s> indeed the approach seems to be based on a set of assumptions which are to say the least debatable <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefaced my remarks by saying that i was sure that we should all be united the discussion has proved it in agreeing that the construction of any franchise is a sensitive and tricky business <e> <s> i do not think that anything i have said can be construed as advocating divorce so as to increase the possibility of multiple voting rights for parents <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments solution is one parent one vote so that the parent with a child or any number of children at a school will have the right to vote <e> <s> as i have said it is up to the school governors to keep the register of parents and to notify anyone known to have an entitlement to vote of his or her right to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord because at the very least he has reminded me of the question on that issue asked by the noble earl lord baldwin <e> <s> i do not believe that there will be a distinction between schools as a result of the guidance that will be issued to governors <e> <s> there will not be a case such as that referred to by the noble earl with the governors of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that in such a case there may be four parents <e> <s> i emphasised in my earlier remarks that such cases would be rare and that we rely upon the good sense and common sense of the governors to deal with those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that wherever we draw the line there will be objectors one side or the other <e> <s> i wish to start by emphasising to the noble baroness lady david that parents of primary school pupils staff at the school and ethers in the community will not be deprived of the right to object <e> <s> the ballot of parents decides only whether an application for grant-maintained status should go forward <e> <s> it is the trigger to the process <e>", "<cs> my lords the government acknowledge the value of an informed debate on possible applications for grant-maintained status <e> <s> we believe that that can only help in making our proposals better understood <e> <s> but we also believe that campaigning must be kept clearly separate from the formal balloting procedure <e> <s> to that end parents will receive with their postal ballot papers purely factual information only on the nature of grant-maintained status and on the specific proposal which the governors would make if the ballot authorised them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the right reverend prelate has said and i see the difficulty but i believe that there are distinctions to be drawn in this case <e> <s> the diocesan education committees are an important part of the administrative structure of church-provided education <e> <s> they are essentially planning bodies and do not themselves own or run schools unlike the local education authority the governors and trustees <e>", "<cs> my lords dealing first with the general point i must repeat that in practice anyone who wishes to comment or object will be able to do so <e> <s> every view expressed will be taken into account <e> <s> there is no question of anybody being able to challenge the secretary of states legal right to consider the objections of people who are not defined as statutory objectors <e> <s> that perhaps makes the point the other way round <e> <s> because the whole process will be subject to any publicity which anyone objecting wishes to give the matter the secretary of state will ignore a valid point at his peril <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that we have not confined the local government electors to the particular local authority district in which the school concerned is situated because there could be many electors in the surrounding districts who may have an interest <e> <s> therefore it would not be appropriate to confine the area in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as i have already pointed out these proposals are based on the arrangements for reorganisation or closure under sections and of the act and we are following that model <e> <s> i repeat that if the secretary of state receives letters or representations pointing out that the staff are solidly opposed to grant-maintained status that would clearly be a most important consideration to be taken into account in coming to his conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords although we recognise the concern behind this amendment we cannot accept it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston has said the bill provides that when a school becomes grant-maintained any relevant debt charges remain the responsibility of the local education authority <e> <s> we are concerned here with debt charges that may have been incurred for capital expenditure or capital improvements which occurred before the school became grant-maintained <e> <s> it would be both complex and pointless to transfer the funding for such charges from the local education authority to the grant-maintained school concerned <e> <s> first the appropriate sum of money would have to be identified then my right honourable friend the secretary of state would have to pay an additional grant to the school to meet the payments and finally he would have to recover the cost of the grant from the local education authority <e> <s> there seems to be no case for such a circular exercise especially as i have said the governors of the grant-maintained school will have no discretion over the spending of the money <e>", "<cs> my lords i can appreciate the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> i hoped that my noble friend lord trefgarne had provided the house with this reassurance during the committee stage when replying to the noble lord lord dormand of easington <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the chance the amendment gives us to reiterate our firm intention that the introduction of grant-maintained schools should not prejudice the integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream schools <e> <s> the bill already includes a number of safeguards to ensure that such children <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it will be possible for a school to do that <e> <s> once <e>", "<cs> my lords in proposing to remove from the bill that subsection which allows the secretary of state to recover from the lea the money which that authority would have spent on a grant-maintained school if that school had not opted out the noble lord lord peston suggests that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that the last statement made by the right reverend prelate covers the position <e> <s> although we have debated the matter at some length and agreed to many amendments i am sure that those noble lords who still have anxieties in this respect will be reassured by the open-minded attitude of the right reverend prelate and also i hope of the government <e> <s> we shall do whatever is possible further to allay any doubts which may arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble lord lord peston that there is no possibility that grant-maintained schools will be able to charge fees <e> <s> clause explicitly prohibits charging in respect of admission to any maintained school and in respect of the provision of education at the school other than in the limited circumstances set out in chapter v grant-maintained schools will be able to charge for exactly the same things as local authority maintained schools can charge no more no less and there is no possibility of them publishing proposals to do anything else <e> <s> i hope that that sets the noble lords mind at rest on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the right is the same although the procedures may be slightly different but probably on a <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is not acceptable to the government <e> <s> it would be clearly inappropriate for a local education authority which exercised no control over a grant-maintained school to have the power to initiate its demise <e> <s> that decision is a fundamental and crucial one and it should rest with those who are responsible for the school and know it best that is to say the governing body and the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say that i try to listen to noble lords on the other side of the house whenever i can <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it happens so rarely that i think that the noble baroness need not have picked on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state may cease to maintain a grant-maintained school on the following grounds <e> <s> the first is where the number of pupils has dropped to a level where it is impossible to provide them with a full and balanced curriculum at a reasonable cost <e> <s> grant-maintained schools will be no less vulnerable then lea-maintained schools to the effects of demographic change <e> <s> if a school is badly affected by population shifts my right honourable friend the secretary of state needs to be able to take the same sort of action as an lea would in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the committee stage the government fully understand the concerns which underlie the amendment and which are felt on all sides of the house <e> <s> truancy is a very serious matter <e> <s> that is why in des circular / we said that the essential function of local education authorities education welfare services should be the promotion of regular school attendance <e> <s> that is why her majestys inspectorate of schools is currently examining best practice in securing good attendance levels after which the department intends to issue to leas and schools another circular which will be informed by hmis work <e> <s> in addition hmi regularly examines attendance records during school inspections and as i have said before we expect that the introduction of gcse courses and the national curriculum with other initiatives such as tvei and school-industry contacts should improve pupils motivation and thus help to remove the root cause of truancy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am unable to quote precisely on the subject of tvei <e> <s> however i know that in its reports hmi has stated that the gcse courses have improved pupil motivation and indeed the school industry contacts have similarly improved pupil motivation and attendance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must say that i also referred to the <e>", "<cs> my lords local education authorities already have a duty to keep schemes of special education under review <e> <s> the government do not think it would be helpful to require local education authorities to submit schemes for approval along the lines of the proposed amendment <e> <s> we believe that there should be flexibility for local education authorities to adjust their provision according to changing circumstances <e> <s> this subject has been debated <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment as he indicated that he might when presenting it <e> <s> if on reading the record in the light of what my noble friend has said and what was said in the previous debates the noble lord feels it necessary to bring this matter forward again at third reading we would understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the genuine intent of this amendment <e> <s> following the implementation of the education act which enacted many of the recommendations of the committee chaired by the noble baroness lady warnock many more children with special educational needs are being educated in ordinary schools <e> <s> they form an important part of the life of the school and it is right that schools should be responsive to their needs <e> <s> it therefore follows that those who are appointed and elected to govern schools should also be conscious of and alert to their responsibilities to these children <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for moving such a thought provoking amendment <e> <s> this is certainly a very attractive variation on the original ctc idea <e> <s> it would have much that was common with the ctc programme <e> <s> for example the it emphasis in ctcs stands four square with contemporary developments in the arts such as satellite television <e> <s> as my noble friend has explained somewhat ingeniously my noble friend intends that such an institution would provide a national resource for teaching in the technological and practical aspects of the performing and creative arts <e>", "<cs> my lords the first two of these amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and seek fundamentally to change how ctcs are funded <e> <s> from the outset of the programme the government have made it clear that they will share the capital costs of ctcs with sponsors and that they will meet all normal running costs <e> <s> the ctc initiative has attracted an unprecedented response to an education initiative more than million has already been pledged by industry <e> <s> that is a mark of the confidence that the business community has in the ctc programme <e> <s> we have no doubt that considerably more money will be raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm or deny the figure to be provided by the treasury because it has not been finalised <e> <s> i cannot remember what the second point was <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> what is proving interesting with the ctcs that are most advanced is that although the original sponsors who came forward pledged a large amount of money once local industry is aware of the progress being made with these ctcs it is coming forward and pledges and funding from local industry is increasing <e> <s> i am happy to say that it is a good picture all round <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment restates the relevant provisions of section of the education act <e> <s> as the noble lord lord young has said we discussed the matter in a slightly different form at the committee stage <e> <s> i appreciate the concern of the movers of the amendment <e> <s> so it may be helpful if i briefly describe the kinds of questions which the secretary of state puts to those seeking voluntary-aided status <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have on numerous occasions made clear their belief that it is undesirable for pupils of a school to be members of the governing body of the institution they attend <e> <s> we do not believe that they could play a full part in all the matters which governing bodies are called upon to determine and it is of paramount importance given the increased responsibilities which governing bodies will shortly assume that all members are able to take a full share in their work <e>", "<cs> my lords the government sympathise with the intention behind these amendments that is to ensure that boarding education is provided free of charge where this is necessary to meet the particular educational needs of an individual child <e> <s> but this position is already secured in statute and by the provisions on the face of the bill these amendments are unnecessary and would i fear simply confuse rather than clarify matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there are anomalies in the present law relating to controlled schools which need attention <e> <s> the secretary of state has some sympathy with the intention of these amendments to enable the church authorities to contribute towards the cost of providing a new controlled school or enlarging an existing one with an appropriate assurance that their interests will be safeguarded if the school later closes <e>", "<cs> my lords the new clause is intended to restore the implied obligation on schools in section of the act <e> <s> that is the reason the duty and responsibility remains on the governing body <e> <s> in practice of course it is clear that the governing body would consult the teachers and the head teacher in particular <e> <s> we will certainly make clear in guidance that powers can be delegated to the head teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand why the proposers of this amendment seek to ensure that school governing bodies should not have an inbuilt political bias as a result of the way the local authority makes its appointments <e> <s> but i do not believe that this amendment would have that effect <e> <s> indeed i believe that it could be counter-productive and i shall try to explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not accept the amendments <e> <s> that is not because we do not value adult education <e> <s> quite the contrary <e> <s> i am happy to take this opportunity to emphasise that the government fully recognise the importance of adult education <e> <s> it provides a great many people with a great deal of benefit and pleasure <e> <s> our further education service indeed our national life would be poorer without it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must re-emphasise that we feel that clause since it is so very broadly drawn includes and embraces adult education <e> <s> the fact that in the past this has not been so or has not been recognised in that way is something with which we shall have to cope in helping people to understand the meaning that we give it in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords although the government cannot accept these amendments we accept that it is important that staff students and the community in general should be able to participate in further education <e> <s> we believe that further education is very much a local service provided for the local community and it is right that we should enable all those involved to play an active part <e> <s> but i submit that that general principle does not require legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have explained on previous occasions the need for keeping those bodies to a reasonable size in order that they may be at their most effective <e> <s> again while there is nothing to prevent representatives of more than one of the categories suggested being on a governing body we should not wish to impose that as a requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed at some length at committee stage the boundary between the secondary and further education sectors <e> <s> after that debate i wrote to the noble baronesses lady david and lady seear explaining the governments position in more detail <e> <s> i shall therefore try to be brief in speaking to the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that he is speaking to amendment no <e> <s> which appears later on the marshalled list in relation to speech therapists <e> <s> the amendment that i have moved deals with a different and wider point <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention behind this amendment is to make explicit that the duty inherent in subsection of this clause has reference to students with special educational needs as well as to other students <e> <s> i feel that the suggestion of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway to add to that would build on the original clause in a way that was not intended by the movers of amendments at a different stage <e> <s> i must say that i am very glad to note the welcome that has been given to this amendment <e> <s> i commend it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords by this amendment the local education authorities would be required to consult all maintained and substantially assisted institutions of further and higher education including those adult education centres which provide only part-time education <e> <s> the government do not believe that that would be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as with premature retirement and dismissal costs the costs arising from voluntary severance would normally be met by the local education authority <e> <s> however the local education authority will be able to charge the whole or any part of such costs to the colleges budget if it has good reason to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we spent a considerable time at an earlier stage debating the principle of the governments proposals for education in inner london <e> <s> i said at that stage that many of the amendments then before the house would inject delay and uncertainty into a situation which is actually best resolved by swift and determined action <e> <s> your lordships agreed with that assessment and like the other place resoundingly endorsed the governments proposals <e> <s> these amendments are very similar to those rejected by your lordships six weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken at length and fully answered the points that my noble friend has chosen to raise further <e> <s> i said at the outset that to create uncertainty for another four years followed by a further two years would not help anyone and certainly not the people whom we aim to benefit <e> <s> i also clearly demonstrated by what i said that thorough consultation is taking place and planning in considerable detail is going along <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made the plans and consultation processes perfectly clear <e> <s> i see no cause for anxiety about the way the development plans are going forward <e> <s> a longer delay could only give rise to further uncertainty and confusion and will impede the plans that are already going ahead so successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady seear has proposed i think the very same amendment she put down at committee stage <e> <s> perhaps i might be permitted to begin then by reminding her of the main reasons why we believe that a pan-london solution of the type she proposes could not work <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important subject and the government recognise it as such <e> <s> that will have been clear from some of what i have already said <e> <s> it may however be of assistance to the house if i say a little more about the governments view before explaining why i do not think that any of these amendments and i believe we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> zb aa and cb at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case perhaps i may remind the house of the words contained in the draft guidance on development plans <e> <s> it is the governments firm view not only that the inner london councils are capable of becoming effective local education authorities responsible in their own right for the full range of services but above all that this restructuring will provide a stable framework within which to secure urgently needed improvements in the performance and accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and that is why i was talking about the careers service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming on to how this ties in <e> <s> this service is currently performed by the central london careers office and it is on this aspect in particular that we have opened discussions <e> <s> there are several possibilities and one with some advantages would be for one organisation to provide a central service <e> <s> as i said we have had preliminary discussions and i know that among others the city of london and some employer forums are willing to explore these possibilities further with the help of ilea <e> <s> we recognise that the financial implications will need to he addressed and that some financial assistance from central government might be appropriate at least in the initial years <e> <s> we look forward to continued discussions with all concerned with a view to reaching firm decisions as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the basic premise of our plans for ilea is that all education functions devolve to the boroughs except in the exceptional cases where some other arrangement has proved necessary <e> <s> that is certainly the thinking at this initial stage <e> <s> as i said we believe that there is plenty of scope for co-operation between the boroughs and we prefer that to happen on a truly voluntary basis and not to be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in thinking that we are speaking now to amendments nos <e> <s> aa and ab <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment makes provision for joint schemes which would enable a simple majority of inner london councils seven out of the to impose their wishes in respect of co-operative arrangements on the remaining six <e> <s> taking the most extreme grouping that would enable authorities with responsibility for schools to impose their wishes on authorities responsible for schools <e> <s> that is a recipe for friction <e> <s> i venture to say that it would lead to the reverse of co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a certain amount of sympathy with some at least of the aims of this amendment <e> <s> there might be some benefit if local education authorities generally carried out the sort of annual policy review envisaged <e> <s> indeed many already do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is wrong to suggest that all posts in the management structure as the noble lord lord morton suggested require the secretary of states approval <e> <s> this amendment relates to the chief education officer and to others who may be designated <e> <s> the designation of other posts will be restricted only to those cases which are clearly essential <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i am not in a position to tell noble lords exactly what will be the guidance <e> <s> the intention is that the normal factors applying to appointments should be applied and i have no reason to believe therefore that the fear expressed by the noble lord is in any way justified <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said this is not an entirely new kind of provision <e> <s> a similar provision existed under the act <e> <s> i believe therefore that the same considerations apply <e> <s> it is something which has been experienced before in this country <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> i did not wish to infer that the noble lord had made a misrepresentation in any way <e> <s> i was simply pointing out that the requirement that existed under the act was in a similar vein <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord morton of shuna has said i promised at committee stage that the government would be tabling amendments designed to ensure that the secretary of state may designate former ilea schools to be maintained by local education authorities other than those in inner london <e> <s> there was never any doubt that it would be possible under the provisions of the bill as they then stood to transfer responsibility in this way perhaps for example in relation to some of the residential special schools located outside inner london <e> <s> but it seemed preferable to put the process of designation for schools outside the ilea area on all fours with the procedure applying inside inner london <e> <s> this is one of the effects of the government amendments included in the group we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware that some key members of ileas staff have already left and that many more may be thinking about doing so <e> <s> we therefore sympathise with the concern behind the amendment <e> <s> we need to strike a careful balance between encouraging the <e>", "<cs> my lords the removal of this clause would have the effect of removing from the secretary of state the power to prevent the ilea from granting unjustified increases in pay in the period up to abolition <e> <s> that is not to say that we expect the ilea to implement excessive pay increases for the whole of or even for most of it <e> <s> the need to balance its budget will prevent that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i am not aware that the government have any intention of dealing with the boroughs in the way suggested by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered the arguments carefully <e> <s> we accept that the confusion in the last few days of the life of the glc was considerable and could have left uncertainty in the minds of many ilea recruits <e> <s> to the extent that some members of that group might have to face the possibility of redundancy for a second time as a result of government policy they indeed deserve our sympathy <e> <s> it appears that in practice there is only one category of ex-glc employee who if made redundant would suffer significantly <e> <s> this category comprises those members of staff under years of age with years service who would receive less generous compensation under the general terms to be set out in the regulations than they would have received if they had retained their glc terms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to see what effect these amendments nos <e> <s> h to p will have at this stage <e> <s> ilea has been seeking consent to contracts and disposals since last july in the full knowledge that the government intended to bring forward these provisions <e> <s> the date of nd july was the date on which the secretary of state announced in the other place that these provisions would apply originally of course in relation to the ilea provisions included in the bill as then introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords as in the case of a number of other services which we have been discussing the governments first priority is to discuss the future of the supplies organisation with its users and potential users ilea the inner london boroughs the outer london boroughs and others <e> <s> because the organisation has so many customers we have not yet been able to open a full debate <e> <s> but we have made it clear in discussion with ilea and the boroughs that this is a service whose future whether or not as an independent commercial enterprise we shall wish to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise the importance of the link and co-operation with the voluntary organisations <e> <s> most of the help that ilea gives to voluntary organisations is through voluntary youth organisations <e> <s> discussions are going on and we have emphasised that in their draft guidance the boroughs must focus on this area <e> <s> however the government see no advantage in their conducting the type of review envisaged by the amendment <e> <s> it will be for the boroughs themselves to assess the needs of their local communities after <e> <s> one of the major advantages of our proposals is that the boroughs will be able to make an appropriate and flexible response to local needs in co-operation with voluntary organisations <e> <s> i trust therefore as i too have a number of longer notes which i could have used to develop the theme that the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat what the noble baroness has kindly reminded us of namely that ilea has been most helpful and i have no reason to doubt that its co-operation will continue <e> <s> however having said that there must always remain the faint possibility that this atmosphere of excellent co-operation might slip at some point between now and april <e> <s> therefore we believe it is important that the basic provisions of this section should remain in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate i have tried to emphasise that a careful balance needs to be struck between ensuring that the ilea can continue to provide an effective education service in the period to april and to assist the london boroughs individually to prepare to take on the full responsibilities of local education from that date <e> <s> it is clear that many ilea staff members will provide the key to that operation <e> <s> they will be needed by both the ilea and the boroughs and so some system of dual appointments will be necessary to facilitate that process <e> <s> the amendment supports that concept by removing any contractual obstacle to having two employers <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have no doubt that consultation will take place <e> <s> as i have said a forum for discussing staff matters involving all the parties concerned has been set up and no doubt it will be a proper forum for formulating such action <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly concern in the area of non-educational provision in particular over the provision of speech therapy services <e> <s> i undertook to look at this point following the debate at committee stage <e> <s> we have considered this matter most carefully to see whether it is possible at least to go back to where we thought the law stood before the oxfordshire judgment in <e>", "<cs> my lords i can respond positively to both those points <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i find this amendment totally restrictive <e> <s> the government are aware of plans to establish an independent trust which has the aim of supporting the development of grant-maintained schools <e> <s> we welcome that initiative <e> <s> if the proposed trust or indeed any other body makes a case for financial support for a centre offering information and advice to grant-maintained schools the government will consider that case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe i said quite clearly that if a proposed trust or any other body makes a case for financial support the government will consider it on its merits <e> <s> that implies i should have thought that the secretary of state has the power to do that if he considers that it fulfils the requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords in drawing up regulations to give effect to the new arrangements we shall having consulted very fully consider carefully the responses to the consultation document including <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the benefits of school and other collective experience for children under five but our view is that it would be totally misconceived to impose a general duty of this kind upon local education authorities <e> <s> publicly-funded education for the under-fives important and desirable though it is must compete with other education needs and sectors for the finite resources available <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house so far as i am aware the government have no <e>", "<cs> my lords the clause does not give the secretary of state a free hand <e> <s> he will have to demonstrate that it is reasonable to believe that a particular modification is necessary or expedient as a result of financial delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for introducing this amendment in her usual clear and helpful way <e> <s> i should like to reiterate that we understand and welcome the efforts of the british schools in the european community to provide a sound education for the children of british citizens working in europe <e> <s> it is because we do so that we have agreed already to provide help for them in a number of particular and practical ways which i enumerated at the previous stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house what i can say is that we shall certainly look and seek to find a solution through a suitable scheme and i very much hope that a suitable scheme can come out of that <e> <s> but of course i cannot give any copper-bottomed guarantee at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point i agree with the noble baroness lady darcy that parents should be told of their right to appeal not only against modification and disapplications of the national curriculum but also against any amendments to the statement made under the act <e> <s> i can undertake to ensure that that point will be covered by the guidance which we shall be issuing on the implementation of the provisions <e> <s> i hope that that will help <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking my noble friend for giving me notice of the points that he was proposing to make <e> <s> he has raised a matter of some importance and i can confirm in answer to his question that the bill does not change the law relating to school transport <e> <s> that law applies principally to the functions of local education authorities <e> <s> they will retain the flexibility to adopt school transport policies suited to local needs within the overall rules laid down in statute <e>", "<cs> my lords as a solicitor and therefore a member of the law society i recognise the value of this type of organisationi recognise that teachers perform an important jobi am happy to take the opportunity of paying a tribute to teacherswe are convinced that the vast majority of teachers do an important job in a dedicated manner sometimes in difficult circumstancesi should particularly like to pay tribute to the way in which they have coped with the introduction of the gcse and to say that by introducing the national curriculum we hope we are providing them with another exciting challenge to their professional commitmenti recognise that teachers would find a useful role on a general teaching council and would use it as a vehiclebut as i said in my original response we believe that it must also serve the interests of the wider community <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it successive governments have received various proposalsthe last formal proposal was contained in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer the last point first <e> <s> i must emphasise that what i said is that we should like to ensure that it would serve the interests of the relevant parties <e> <s> it is in that context that pupils will figure <e> <s> as i have said the government will consider any specific proposals that are put forward <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be helpful for the government to be seen to be imposing a general teaching council <e> <s> if it is to be successful it must have the widespread support of the professionals and of the other parties concerned <e> <s> i understand that not even the opposition education spokesman in another place who recently announced this idea as new party policy wanted such a body to be imposed by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the government would be quite happy to give a fair wind to that as indeed they did in the case of the weaver working party which was in fact set up by government <e> <s> it is true to say that a general teaching council could be set up in any event <e> <s> but obviously it would he useful to have government recognition and support for such a project <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certain individuals in the country who are most keen on promoting this idea one is professor ross of lancaster university who is in touch with the department <e> <s> the department is being kept fully informed of developments on that front <e> <s> certainly the various initiatives that the department is taking in relation to both initial training and in-service training are i believe evidence of the value which the department places on this matter and the importance which it must bear for the future of the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see absolutely no reason why not <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the government will bear that in mind when considering any possible specific proposal which may emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that is why we feel that this is an important <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are a recipe for a three-tier national curriculum <e> <s> they seek to set out in statute what we have repeatedly said is intended to happen that attainment targets and programmes of study for the core subjects will be set out more fully than those for other foundation subjects and that in the case of music art and pe what is provided will amount to very broad guidelines <e> <s> but these distinctions do not transfer happily into statute <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments look very much like an attempt to give the secretary of state more central control over the school timetable a power we have never wanted and which in response to opposition pressure in another place we have expressly ruled out in clause of the bill <e> <s> i am amazed that after hearing so much about the need to give teachers a free hand to trust their professional judgment and to allow head teachers to use their powers to organise the curriculum one now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there must be unanimity on one point at least that is that we have all tried very hard in our different ways to get this right <e> <s> our thanks are due especially in this respect to the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e> <s> but i am most grateful to all your lordships who have contributed to the debates in our house and who have worked behind the scenes <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that in this case the legitimate concerns of parents head teachers and governors of a school will be met by allowing for full consultation of parents to take place <e> <s> the machinery which would be involved in conducting a ballot is not necessary in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords since i touched on this amendment in my earlier remarks i shall be brief <e> <s> i explained then why the government felt that it was preferable to deal with the expression of the sentiments with which we all agree in the circular which we propose should be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was part of the group that we discussed earlier although my noble friend intimated that he would move his amendment separately <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before and as the noble lady lady kinloss has reminded us there is no reason why the ncc seac or the curriculum council for wales should not establish a special needs sub-committee if they think it necessary to do so <e> <s> that is why schedule to the bill provides for any of the councils to set up committees for any purpose and to appoint to those committees anyone they think fit and suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i shall have to speak against this amendment <e> <s> i much regret that after what has been said but i hope your lordships will permit me to say at this stage that it is our intention later today to accept a further amendment amendment no <e> <s> which will require parents of pupils whose statements of special need are amended to be told of their rights to appeal against that attention <e> <s> but that is looking ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i intervene immediately to say that although as i have said before we believe the definition is quite clear as it stands in view of the noble earls persuasiveness and persistence i am willing to concede the point and to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this proposal was discussed earlier but we still cannot accept the amendment because it runs counter to the basic principle of the governments open enrolment policy <e> <s> we have taken as the yardstick for judging physical capacity the standard number of a school since this is closely related to physical capacity and all schools have one <e> <s> it is important that parents should know that the admissions limit represents the actual number of pupils that a school can take <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that we have not so far been able to set at rest the concerns expressed by the noble lord lord hylton on this subject <e> <s> i have tried on a number of occasions to set out what are now in our view the substantial safeguards in the bill for the role and interests of the trustees of church and other voluntary schools which are contemplating an application for grant-maintained status and so i shall not repeat them now <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the concern of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton and the co-sponsors of this amendment <e> <s> that concern is shared by the government <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the noble lord said on report and to what he said today <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to reassure the house and in particular the noble lord lord young of dartington that existing schools with traditions and specialisations in music and the arts will continue <e> <s> we hope that they will also continue to flourish <e>", "<cs> my lords in discussing the core and other foundation subjects of the curriculum i have explained that the intention is that at secondary school level art music and drama can be included in the core subject of english and that dance can be included in the foundation subject of pe <e> <s> as part of the flexibility that the government intend for these subjects schools will be able to implement them in accordance with any particular tradition or specialisation which they may have <e> <s> i shall go further and say that in including in the national curriculum art and music we are emphasising their importance which in some schools is not necessarily being emphasised at present <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that in responding to the points raised by the noble lord i shall have to look at the amendment in the context of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this matter is perfectly clear because we express one as a city technology college and the other as a city college for the technology of the arts <e> <s> at this moment i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments would insert into clause explicit statements that adult education is a part of further education as the noble baroness has said <e> <s> amendments with much the same purpose have been moved at each stage in the bills passage through both houses of parliament <e> <s> the government recognise the value and importance of adult education and that is why our commitment has been amply demonstrated in the support we give to the national institute of adult and continuing education and indeed to various programmes to develop adult literacy and numeracy and in our commitment in the education support grant programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter has made his case that students with special educational needs at colleges of further education should be brought within the assessment and statementing provisions of the act until the age of <e> <s> i am advised that more detailed changes would be needed to give this intention effect but i should perhaps now concentrate on the issue of substance <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to respond to the specific questions which the noble baroness has asked <e> <s> the first of those was the matter of the definition of disabled students <e> <s> we believe that it would not be right to use an educational definition since that is couched in terms of special educational needs which would not necessarily apply to higher education <e> <s> the general definition in the national assistance act fits best <e> <s> that is one that we shall rely on <e> <s> the definition takes account of all physical and mental disabilities <e> <s> we would not expect institutions to apply it in a narrow and legalistic sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am right in thinking that similar amendments whether for an advisory or executive committee have been discussed at every stage during the bills passage both through this house and another place <e> <s> i regret therefore that there is little that i can add to what has already been said by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that this matter does not exactly come within the scope of the amendment <e> <s> i shall certainly write to the noble lord to give any further explanations that may be necessary to allay his anxieties <e> <s> all that the government are now doing is to place access by the comptroller and auditor general to the universities and funded institutions on a proper statutory footing <e> <s> nothing else changes <e> <s> so far as concerns other supervision and follow-up procedures they remain unchanged <e>", "<cs> my lords we have endeavoured to make clear previously that the government do not intend to tell boroughs how to run an education service <e> <s> it is for the boroughs themselves to determine and state in their development plans how they intend to provide a full and varied service in their areas with of course help and guidance which would be readily at hand from the inner london unit in the department <e> <s> in saying that we fully accept that there will be aspects of the service which will need to be dealt with on the basis of co-operation between boroughs <e> <s> as i explained at report stage we are already discussing many of these special areas with ilea and the boroughs and we have had a series of meetings <e> <s> indeed there was a meeting yesterday chaired by ilea which discussed how best to take forward a number of issues that will need joint consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the persuasiveness of the noble lord lord peston and the noble earl lord baldwin made doubly so by their brevity i am afraid that it is still hard for us to see how this amendment is necessary <e> <s> clause empowers the secretary of state to prohibit a person from holding a particular appointment only where he is of the opinion that the candidate is not a fit person to hold a particular appointment <e> <s> if any person believes that the secretary of state has acted unreasonably in prohibiting an appointment the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the general rules of data protection which affect confidentiality of documents apply to these cases as well <e> <s> but we shall be considering this in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to say that i believe that the risks of subsequent redundancy for people who transfer as a result of restructuring programmes will be very small <e> <s> i appreciate the special knowledge of those noble lords who have contributed to the discussion today <e> <s> however restructuring usually takes place in relatively strong departments and lecturers imported into those departments will see it as a mark of confidence in them <e> <s> moreover not all restructurings will necessarily happen as a result of an initiative by the funding council so how shall we decide whether any given situation should benefit from the arrangement now proposed <e> <s> there are other difficulties in determining the circumstances in which transferred academics should receive tenure in the way proposed by the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i reassure the noble lord that on finding this difficulty we have endeavoured to stop it <e> <s> we are aware of an institution which comes into this category and is therefore covered by the amendment <e> <s> we have sought to prevent any other bogus institutions from taking advantage of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i endeavoured to make clear on report that we are sympathetic to the motives of those who have tabled this amendment <e> <s> however when the new school governing bodies are introduced this autumn as a result of the education no <e> <s> act no single interest group will have a majority <e> <s> there will be between two and five lea-appointed governors depending on the size of the school there will be exactly the same number of elected parent governors there will be teacher governors and the biggest single group will be co-opted governors representing the local community <e> <s> even if all the lea appointees are of the same political persuasion and i very much hope that that will not often happen though i accept that examples have been given there will no longer be scope for one particular party or faction to dominate a governing body <e> <s> that was the whole point of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have taken many steps in the course of the bills passage to reassure teachers and indeed have introduced amendments in response to various aspects of the bill <e> <s> clause is necessary to guarantee teachers rights for example to place responsibility on governors to allow teachers time off for union duties maternity leave and other rights which teachers need to be fully aware of <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble lord that this type of provision is not unusual and follows from the decisions of principle which have been agreed by your lordships house <e> <s> my understanding is that amendment no <e> <s> extends the provision to scotland because the power to vary local acts may need to be applied in the university context there just as in england <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said we have discussed this matter before <e> <s> but this amendment approaches the topic via a rather different route <e> <s> i shall speak first about the effect of paragraph b of the amendment but i shall come to paragraph a later <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the position correctly the demand already exists at present and that is why the government are considering the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the wider discussion that the noble baroness reintroduces was gone into very thoroughly in when the decision was taken to separate the responsibilities of the authorities in the way that now pertains <e> <s> it is always possible to alter an amendment in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the result on the last division i am happy that i trailed that factor yesterday to show that it was not a direct consequence <e> <s> we are indeed happy to accept the amendment <e> <s> in saying that i should like to pay tribute to the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth who with her colleagues has demonstrated determination and perseverance in her attempts to improve the details of the bill in so far as they affect children with special educational needs <e> <s> i have no doubt that in future there will be parents who have cause to be grateful for this and other amendments which have been passed <e> <s> the government are happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the lill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will be grateful to me if i do not attempt to respond in detail to all the points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sometimes difficult when on the one hand the noble lord lord stewart of fulham criticises the bill for leaving far too much to guidelines and on the other hand the noble baroness lady secar accuses the government of producing a rigid and over-prescriptive bill <e> <s> this has been a recurring dilemma in the course of the bill s passage <e> <s> i have emphasised on a number of occasions that this is a framework bill designed to enable change in a number of areas where such change has been under discussion for some years <e> <s> we have also emphasised that where further guidelines and regulations are proposed so too is further consultation with all those involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have accepted the main thrust of the higginson report which is to broaden the sixth-form curriculum <e> <s> that is why we introduced as-levels <e> <s> where we disagree is on higginsons proposal for achieving breadth by streamlining a-level syllabuses reducing the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that if we had accepted all the higginson proposals i should now be answering a question about why we had introduced yet another reform at this stage <e> <s> we believe that with the introduction of the broad and balanced national curriculum up to school leaving age with the introduction of the new gcse school leaving examinations and with the introduction of as levels this year <e> <s> which means that pupils will be sitting the examination for the first time only next year <e> <s> there is enough on the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e>

am grateful for the understanding that has been shown of the governments position <e> <s> i have no doubt that if as she says my noble friend intends to continue with her campaign she will do so most successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her welcome and her most kind remarks <e> <s> i can assure the house that before too long i hope to be sparking on all plugs <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i cannot give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> however i can say on the whole question of environmental control in this area that we put a high priority on pollution control emissions <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords no not without notice <e> <s> however perhaps i can investigate the matter and respond to the noble lords question in a little more detail at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only answer the noble lords question by saying that the government are fully aware that investment in energy efficiency can have a positive environmental impact and our promotions have always been undertaken on the basis that the investment should be both cost-effective and environmentally acceptable <e> <s> i should add that obviously the government are listening to remarks and advice on all fronts and from all places in relation to the proposals under discussion <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> as there are twin targets in this field one of them being energy efficiency and the other being pollution emission controls i think that we are taking all those factors into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to have to say to my noble friend that i feel that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that too is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that the government have listened to the comments which have been made from this house perhaps especially by my noble friend in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course taking that fully into consideration <e> <s> however i believe that in my earlier statement i did not say that it was the cleanest form or the only clean form of energy <e> <s> in fact my departmental responsibilities will include renewables namely wind water and other sources of fuel which are also clean <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i believe that we have a good energy efficiency and conservation programme at present <e> <s> it is for that reason that the government are tackling the matter in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no disagreement with the united states as regards chile <e> <s> we both wish to see an early return to democracy and a better human rights record <e> <s> differences in approach should not mask the reality of our aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his constructive and optimistic approach based upon his considerable and first-hand knowledge of chile and of latin america in general <e> <s> together with the united states and our european community partners we certainly welcome the opportunity that the people of chile were given to express their will for the way in which that plebiscite was conducted and for the prompt recognition of the result by the government <e> <s> we now wish to see an orderly and peaceful restoration of democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords since the plebiscite on th october we have considered our policy towards chile and we see no reason to change it especially in the light of the moves towards democracy <e> <s> in fact our main sales have been to the chilean navy <e> <s> for example four second-hand frigates of s vintage have been sold <e> <s> we take great care not to approve items that we judge likely to be used for internal repression <e> <s> it has been the policy of successive british governments not to disclose details of potential defence sales <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy does not imply approval of chiles poor human rights record in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> we have a long-established relationship with the chilean navy <e> <s> we are now satisfied that our defence sales policy is both responsible and correct <e>

democracy have been detailed <e> <s> it is expected that the election will take place in december of next year and that general pinochet will remain in power until march when the newly-elected government will take over <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my noble friend or i were using the long-established relationship as any kind of justification for some of the effects of the regime in chile <e> <s> we nevertheless do not believe that our arms policy towards chile has encouraged the dislikable elements of that regime <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the noble lord lord dean of beswick speaks for all of us in offering sympathy to those bereaved and injured as a result of the accident <e> <s> obviously the government and everyone concerned with this sad event wish to deal as sympathetically as possible with the issues arising therefrom <e> <s> the noble lord lord cullen has already made the departments own interim report widely available <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the representations he has made today will be brought to the attention of lord cullen <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed aware of the shadow that this serious accident has cast <e> <s> the governments overriding concern has been to make the fullest and earliest use of whatever lessons can be learnt from this tragic event <e> <s> if changes or new regulations prove necessary they will be made <e> <s> the department of energy has already asked operators to review urgently pipeline isolation systems and has written to the industry to highlight six areas of work which should be immediately reviewed in the light of the interim report of the technical investigation of the accident <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has already indicated to parliament that if the public inquiry can recommend improvements to the present safety regime then those will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that that aspect will be taken into account <e> <s> if any employee feels concerned about safety on an offshore installation under any circumstances he may contact the department of energy offshore safety directorate <e> <s> each installation displays the telephone number and anonymity is guaranteed <e> <s> workers offshore also have the normal protection provided by the employment protection act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position either to confirm or deny those reports which have appeared in the press <e> <s> but obviously occidental or anyone in occidentals situation will look carefully at all relevant considerations in constructing any new platforms or rigs <e> <s> however i am aware that occidental has announced that it will meet the costs of legal representation of bereaved families and survivors at the public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the department is prepared to make any information available to lord cullen <e> <s> during the period before the public inquiry starts and during the time of the inquiry obviously it is for lord cullen to decide what may be disseminated <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of the united kingdom euratom iaea safeguards agreement permit us to withdraw code n material from the safeguards with advance notice but i can once again assure the noble lord that we have no plans to do so <e> <s> i repeat that there is and has been no secrecy about the import of uranium from namibian sources for britains civil nuclear programme between and <e> <s> that fact has been made public by ministers on many occasions in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is another question <e> <s> i can give your lordships the assurance that no uranium ore concentrate has been delivered to the united kingdom for defence purposes since from any source nor has any imported for the civil programme been switched <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that question has already been answered <e> <s> i repeat that the tons of uranium from namibia were delivered for britains civil programme between and <e> <s> the government have no plans for any change in the end use <e>", "<cs> my lords the material to which the question on the order paper refers is as i have said classified with the n label <e> <s> obviously details of contracts are commercially confidential to the parties concerned <e> <s> much of this material is in use in the system in different places <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make it clear once and for all to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby that it is not for the receiving country to change the restrictions under which the material is supplied <e> <s> the euratom authorities assign the appropriate coding according to the conditions imposed by the government of the supplying country <e>", "<cs> my lords as frequently is the case in your lordships house the task of winding up a debate during the course of which considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that every type of technology requires a different level of investment in order to make it possible to make commercial use of it <e>", "<cs> my lords have said that we considered very fully the suggestions of the committee that we believe a further review will take place in the normal course of events and that it will be adquate because all the interested parties will be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that i do not feel in the least embarrassed <e> <s> i am sorry that i have not been able to convince him that very thorough consideration was given at the time that the decision was made and of course within the department we shall look at the comments made in the course of the debate together with the recommendation of the report <e> <s> however i cannot feel that time and energy should be wasted in looking into the past when what we clearly need to do is to look to the future in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the government very much appreciate the offer which was made <e> <s> i have no doubt that the commitment and specialised knowledge of the volunteers could be useful in some way in the very unlikely event of an emergency <e> <s> i understand that it is in that spirit that the atomic energy authority has responded to the gesture <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that our job in government is to reassure people both as to the unlikelihood of such a situation arising and as to the minimising of any effects <e> <s> our first priority must be just that to minimise the effects of an emergency <e> <s> the procedures which are in place exist to do just that <e> <s> nevertheless as i have said the atomic energy authority has i believe accepted the offer in the spirit in which it was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any willing volunteer will be rebuffed by the government <e>

believe refer to nuclear arms or nuclear war it relates to the civil uses of nuclear energy <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the last part of the noble lords question as an unfestive remark <e> <s> nevertheless it is true that the first priority in the very unlikely event of such an accident would be for immediate action <e> <s> that means that emergency workers would have to wear protective equipment including self-contained breathing apparatus and they could be subjected to extremes of heat and humidity <e> <s> they might be required to undertake very active service <e> <s> it is for that reason that the emergency plans that are in place concentrate on experts in effect in fire fighting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord williams of elvel and lord ezra for their albeit in some respects guarded welcome to this small bill <e> <s> i believe it is a christmas tree bill and not just as in american terminology a christmas bill <e> <s> i shall endeavour to answer as fully as possible the barrage of questions that were raised while understanding the noble lord lord williams when he said that rights are reserved to go into these matters further at the committee stage <e> <s> of course that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the corporate plan comes into the report and accounts that is certainly so <e> <s> however the primary purpose of the committees investigation is to look at the report and accounts not at the capital requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords crystal ball gazing is perhaps not appropriate in this context <e> <s> however in taking a major step such as the privatisation of the electricity supply industry it is important that we should concentrate all our efforts <e> <s> for the time being there are certainly no plans to look at any changes in regard to the ownership and operation of bnfl which we believe is working efficiently and satisfactorily under the present arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government have kept the matter constantly under review with the relevant people in gibraltar <e> <s> meetings have recently taken place and there will be further discussions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we are hoping that by encouraging the gibraltar government to consider this in addition to other benefits which we believe the agreement will bring to the people of gibraltar they will see their way to joining in <e>", "<cs> my lords the meeting did take place and this topic arose <e> <s> other meetings have taken place and further meetings are due to take place on a regular basis to discuss general matters <e> <s> i am not at liberty to give details of the discussions which took place <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we can all understand some of the anxieties of the people of gibraltar but we are trying to convince them of the benefit that this agreement can bring to them while making it absolutely clear that there have been no concessions on sovereignty and that the airport will remain under british control <e> <s> we hope and trust that they will come round <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitated in responding to my noble friends first supplementary question <e> <s> i believe that a representative of gibraltar was present during the previous discussions and i see no reason why that should not continue <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> those staying on at school do achieve better qualifications <e> <s> most of them take one year courses at gcse level in order to improve their qualifications <e> <s> typically they achieve one or more passes and better grades in up to three further subjects <e> <s> furthermore the a-level scene is also improving <e> <s> the figures for england in show students or nearly per cent <e> <s> of the year-olds have achieved one or more a-level passes in school <e> <s> when one considers full-time students in fe colleges the number increases to students <e> <s> they will now be able to take as-levels as well which should have a further impact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to give the noble lord the exact figure at this moment <e> <s> we realise that our staying-on rate is not as good as that of other countries <e> <s> this accounts for the reforms that have been introduced into our education system <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that there is a dawning realisation that leaving school without any qualifications makes the finding of a job difficult <e> <s> however there is a good deal of evidence that the improvement in the staying-on rate is as a result of the restructuring of the exam system in the gcse and as-levels besides other kinds of programmes such as cpve and tvei <e> <s> they provide more attractive forms of provision for year-olds we certainly hope that the trend will continue in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that may well be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence to show that giving young people a right to a maintenance allowance would have a significant effect on the participation rate <e> <s> we believe that the experience of young people at school and the qualifications they achieve at the age of are far more important in motivating them to stay on <e>", "<cs> my lords the staying-on rate in for all year-olds in full-time education at school or further and higher education establishments was per cent <e> <s> in that figure had increased to per cent <e> <s> with the addition of the yts figures which provided a further per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the coherence that the national council for vocational qualifications will bring as a result of its work will help very much in the pattern of post- vocational courses <e> <s> the work of the council is progressing satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords substantial reforms were made to the whole education system as a result of the education reform bill which passed through the house earlier this year <e> <s> the government will be keeping under review the consequences of those reforms and seeing how they reflect on a-levels <e> <s> as we have said in the past the introduction of as-level is already having an impact and we expect it to have a continuing impact in broadening the base of studies at that stage in the school career <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have participated in the debate so enabling us to benefit from their knowledge and expertise <e> <s> i shall endeavour to reply to as many as possible of the questions raised and no doubt i shall be reminded should i omit any point <e>", "<cs> my lords the piper alpha incident was unexpected and action had to be taken quickly <e> <s> i am not in a position to say whether or when the government will be issuing guidelines <e> <s> however as i have said the arrangements that have been made so far have been made as a result of considerable and wide consultation <e> <s> that consultation process will obviously not be stopped out of hand at this stage <e> <s> i believe that the overall estimated costs of abandonment which in the majority of cases will not be taking place or occurring until the turn of the century are in the region of million <e> <s> those are the figures that i have been given <e>", "<cs> my lords it is million <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point of the noble lord <e> <s> however i can say only that it is not unusual for tax changes to affect revenue from existing assets and existing production <e> <s> unfortunately we are all subject to the effect of tax changes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the tax changes are effective from july of last year as a result of the finance act although they may apply to operations which have been in existence since <e> <s> therefore they are not retrospective <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have not succeeded in explaining the position as i understand it <e> <s> the tax changes are effective that is the additional tax if any from july last year on all operations that have started in <e> <s> however the tax will not be backdated to apply as from <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the position slightly more <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the reduction proposed in the energy efficiency offices programme for the coming year is a direct result of the successes achieved in the earlier campaign <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will all agree that the object of a campaign is to have some effect and when one has a successful campaign one acts accordingly <e> <s> however it is precisely because of the greenhouse effect to which the noble lord lord ezra referred that we are taking energy efficiency just as seriously as we did before and making it an essential part of our programme and plans <e>", "<cs> my lords in the governments privatisation proposals we take into account the role of energy efficiency <e> <s> we are breaking new ground in promoting energy efficiency within the industry and by customers <e> <s> for example the director general and the secretary of state will both be required and have a duty placed upon them to promote efficiency and suppliers will be required to provide consumers with guidance on efficient energy use <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that in responding to the previous question i answered the points raised by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> the distribution companies are the suppliers <e> <s> a duty will be placed upon them to provide consumers with guidance on the efficient use of electricity <e> <s> in the climate of competition which privatisation will engender with other forms of energy there will be competition between suppliers of energy in other fields as well <e> <s> the duty placed on the director general and the secretary of state will ensure that the generation side of the equation is also covered <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of the regulation is to ensure that the generation of electricity will be carried out according to certain requirements that are felt necessary and it is the regulatory scheme which will ensure efficient generation <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that my noble friend has been straying slightly from the question on the order paper <e> <s> that is also true of some of the previous questions <e> <s> however the licences dealing <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i believe that is the case <e> <s> they are available <e>", "<cs> my lords the fire which occurred in october in a nuclear pile at windscale was not concealed from the public <e> <s> indeed a detailed white paper on the accident was published within a month and a further three white papers within a year of the fire <e> <s> no comparable accident has since occurred at a nuclear plant in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the incident to which the noble lord refers was an unplanned release of strontium earlier in <e> <s> the fire accident took place in october <e> <s> this was reported <e> <s> the release of the papers on st january this year was by no means the first report of that incident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for clarifying the record <e>", "<cs> my lords i must not pre-empt the discussions and decisions of your lordships house <e> <s> however the independent nuclear installations inspectorate which was set up as a consequence of the windscale fire has proved that valuable lessons have been learnt as a result of that accident and has formed the basis of todays safety culture <e> <s> we believe that the united kingdoms nuclear industry has a safety record

that would be quite inappropriate for todays civil nuclear programme <e>", "<cs> my lords today the industry makes enormous efforts to inform the public about nuclear matters through publications and allowing site visits <e> <s> when i visited sellafield last year i was informed that it was the fastest growing tourist attraction in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the information of the noble lord lord hatch comes not so much from the macmillan papers as from an article in the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for explaining the objective behind his amendment and for reiterating some of the questions that he raised in the course of the second reading <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for adding a note of wisdom to the debate and for making clear a matter which often offends me also <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord hatch that the safe disposal of nuclear waste is very much in the governments thinking <e> <s> however it does not relate to the point of clause and this borrowing limit <e> <s> at the moment nirex has made a thorough survey of all the possibilities for a site <e> <s> we await its recommendations and will give them full consideration <e> <s> there can be no doubt that the public will be kept fully informed through the planning procedures involved <e> <s> the position is perfectly well covered <e>", "<cs>

inflation rate was taken into account in making the original estimates <e> <s> if there was an overrun of the anticipated inflation rate that would have been reflected in the additional cost <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not have a full breakdown of the figures in relation to the original estimates and the actual detail of the overrun <e> <s> however i think that i can go so far as to say that the overrun has now been reflected in the work which has been completed <e> <s> it is certainly not anticipated that there will be any further overrun in the way i appreciate that the noble lord lord williams of elvel fears might be a possibility <e> <s> i must reiterate that to the best of our possible ability to make calculations at this point it is true to say that the million limit may be more than will be needed in the next five-year period <e>", "<cs> the amendment relates to the second category of expenses recoverable under this clause that is to say those incurred in connection with the carrying out of research into nuclear safety at the direction of the commission <e> <s> the first category <e>", "<cs> the legal advice i had in anticipation of the noble lords remarks was that which i have outlined <e> <s> under section a it is the duty of the executive to exercise those functions on behalf of the commission <e> <s> it is within the commissions remit to decide the matter <e> <s> we are talking here about an additional power for the secretary of state if necessary to direct the commission or the executive in whatever research the secretary of state feels coverage by the commission is inadequate <e>", "<cs> it may help to clarify the need for clause if i explain that the united kingdom atomic energy authority is in a different category from other nuclear installations operators <e> <s> because of its position as a public body it is not required to provide separate insurance for its liabilities under the act <e> <s> cover is instead provided by public funds <e> <s> however the authority became a trading fund in and occasions may arise when commercial insurance may be considered a more attractive option than the present arrangements <e> <s> in such circumstances we should want to be able to take account of that insurance when working out how much public money is needed to meet compensation claims <e> <s> that is what clause is intended to do and i believe does <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot because i do not think that it adds anything to the clause which fully copes with the situation <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the intention of the noble lord lord williams in introducing these amendments <e> <s> the effects of the amendments are not dissimilar to those of the clause as written <e> <s> in order to clarify matters perhaps i should make clear that the amendments made by clause of the bill could not take effect before section of the nuclear installations act the provision being amended itself came into force <e> <s> where it is necessary for a bill to amend an earlier act retrospectively the draftsman often uses a form of words like that contained in clause of the bill or at least so i understand <e> <s> for example it secures that where the provision to be amended has already been amended at an earlier date since its original enactment the later amendment takes effect at the correct time <e>", "<cs> i wished slightly to pre-empt the noble lord by saying that i am not sure that i can quote him chapter and verse of precedents at this moment <e> <s> however i am assured that the provision is normal in legislation and that it is often used by the draftsman <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the concern that exists regarding any risks or dangers flowing from nuclear accidents <e> <s> we of course regard safety as being of paramount importance <e> <s> the government have no quarrel at all with the principle that the public should be kept fully informed in the event of a nuclear accident of radiological safety significance whether it occurs in this country or abroad <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> it is my belief that that point has already been dealt with by the new procedures that are now in place to cover this situation <e> <s> in fact at the time of the incident to which the noble lord refers a panel of radiobiological consultants was set up and agreed that the maximum observed levels of contamination were below hazard levels and that it was highly unlikely that any harm had been caused to any individual <e> <s> destruction of milk did indeed take place after the subsequent fire accident in october but no milk ban was judged necessary in respect of the pre-accident emissions <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the remarks made by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> however i had hoped i had made it clear that it simply was not necessary <e> <s> is it our business to put into legislation something which is not necessary <e> <s> i do not believe so <e>", "<cs> perhaps the best i can do is to say that i will take back the amendment and look at it in order to deal with it at a subsequent stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the

to continue its interest <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i believe that the original project was for a tonnes a day experiment <e> <s> it has been scaled down to a more flexible - tonnes a day in order to solve process problems <e>", "<cs> that were identified in the late s <e> <s> the insistence on scaling-down has been justified <e> <s> the process route now employed at the point of ayr plant has important differences a higher conversion efficiency and an improved yield compared with the earlier larger scheme <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as i understand it the sasol arrangements are aimed at indirect liquefaction <e> <s> our project at point of ayr is aimed at direct liquefaction and as i said we are also involved in a third type of technology pyrolysis <e>", "<cs> my lords as this programme is well under way i believe that there is absolutely no need for that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of areas in which research and development have taken place much more recently than before the last war as a result of improved technology <e> <s> this is clearly one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i must acknowledge my noble and learned friends superior historical knowledge of the matter <e> <s> i accept his suggestion to the house <e>", "<cs> we are talking about a pilot project my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand my noble friends anxiety to proceed as quickly as possible with this important privatisation and a great deal has already been done in preparation <e> <s> i think he will agree that this government are rather good at doing difficult things but as the saying goes to do the impossible may take a little longer <e> <s> the director general cannot formally be appointed until the electricity bill is enacted though our aim is to identify a candidate at an early stage <e> <s> and the process is under way <e>", "<cs> my lords the director general will not only ensure free and fair competition in the generation of electricity by seeing to it that the contracts between the generators and suppliers are fair but he will also monitor price increases on behalf of the consumer <e> <s> these measures will produce downward pressure on the cost of generation <e>", "<cs> my lords the duties of the director general are fully enumerated in the bill <e> <s> they have also been seen in the licences which were published early in january with an accompanying summary of those duties and a press release <e> <s> it is well understood what the duties and powers of the director general will be <e> <s> the timescale for the appointment of the director general of ofgas was much shorter <e> <s> nevertheless there is general consensus that the success of regulation through ofgas and oftel is there to be seen <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that the director general will have more than two generating companies to deal with <e> <s> we expect there to be a proliferation in the competition to carry out generation as a result of the bill <e> <s> he will be assisted by a staff and there is intended to be a good regional network in place to assist him in his duties <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point i was taking my lead from comments made in another place <e> <s> perhaps i was wrongly advised in doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords what is new about the proposed appointment of a director general of electricity supply is the combination of his duties of regulation with those of consumer protection <e> <s> we see this as an advantage and in view of the regional network to which i referred something that will make the industry even more responsive to consumers needs <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i have said once before in your lordships house we are a listening government <e> <s> we are in this case responding <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the saying i quoted goes <e>", "<cs> my lords he will be responsible to you and me the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords if it helps my noble friend he will be required to make an annual report to the secretary of state and to publish reports issued by the consumers committees <e> <s> there will be plenty of scope for watching closely his activities <e>", "<cs> my lords the euratom authorities assign the appropriate coding according to the conditions imposed by the government of the supplying country and where no conditions are imposed they apply an n coding <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is unlikely <e> <s> bnfl certainly receives uranium from overseas customers for processing and re-export <e> <s> the material is under euratom safeguards while it is in this country and i therefore see no reason why the coding would be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine so but i shall certainly look into that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that question should more properly be directed to the euratom authorities whose task it is <e> <s> nevertheless the conditions are laid down and applied under the terms of the uk euratom international atomic energy authority agreement which we entered into in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it is not for the receiving country to change the restrictions under which the material is supplied <e> <s> i can once again assure the noble lord and the house that since no uranium ore has been delivered to the united kingdom for defence purposes from any source <e>", "<cs> my lords i can perhaps repeat what i said on th november <e> <s> as it is for the euratom authorities to assign the appropriate coding according to the conditions imposed by the government of the supplying country at the time when the contract is signed it is not for the united kingdom government to make any alteration to that coding <e>", "<cs> my lords the emphasis of the campaign has been redirected to the regions as has to some extent the money <e> <s> taking into account all the measures to which i referred in my original answer the total cost of regional support for over and above basic office running costs will be nearly compared with in <e> <s> on the noble lords second supplementary question i agree that energy efficiency measures are extremely important in combating the greenhouse effect and it is towards this end that the government are directing their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords that question strays too far from the original question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a classic case of a pump-priming exercise <e> <s> we believe that the pump has been primed <e> <s> the ability that the government now have to change the resourcing of the energy efficiency office is a direct result of the successes to date in raising consumer awareness of energy efficiency <e> <s> a number of the measures formerly carried out by the government and by taxpayers funding are now being carried out by industry itself <e> <s> the funds which the government are providing are over and above what else is being done by industry itself as a result of the original successful campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking initiatives <e> <s> they have already announced a new best practice scheme in this respect <e> <s> the secretary of state has announced the new drive for energy efficiency in the public sector <e> <s> there are also the reductions that will take place in the areas of direct subsidies and general advertising where the general awareness of the public has been raised <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i said that the noble lords question strayed a little far from the original question on the order paper <e> <s> i should be happy to answer a specific question which the noble lord may wish to put as he has in the past on that subject <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is correct in the figures that he quotes <e> <s> the figure of million will be million in <e> <s> however in response to his question on <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not trying to classify the reductions as priming the pump <e> <s> i said that the original campaign was a pump-priming exercise <e> <s> we believe that it has been successful and that we can use the taxpayers money better through a more targeted approach now <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are giving and will continue to give their steady support to british coals drive to restructure the industry and to make itself competitive internationally <e> <s> the government have faith in the industrys future and that has been demonstrated by our financial support <e> <s> however while the government maintain a large investment programme in the longer term once british coal is financially stronger it is our intention that the corporation should take full financial responsibility for all its new restructuring costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that is what i implied in my last reply <e> <s> we see british coal in future needing to produce secure supplies which are competitive on the world market <e>", "<cs> my lords very good progress is being made on improving productivity which has gone up by per cent <e> <s> since the strike <e> <s> but productivity in our main competitor countries particularly australia and the united states is still over three times as high and is continuing to improve at a rapid rate <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer the conditions of purchase for consumers is a matter for their commercial judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the implication of the last supplementary question <e> <s> we believe that the freedom to import coal if consumers choose to do so is essential and should be encouraged <e> <s> nevertheless the restructuring of the british industry is making it viable and competitive <e> <s> that is why the government are continuing to encourage it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the results of privatisation will be to increase the imports of coal <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i cannot give a detailed reply on the effect on the balance of payments <e> <s> all i can say is that there is a need to import a certain amount of coal for some purposes in any event coking coal for example for use in the steel industry <e> <s> other imports that have been made are necessary to ensure a diversity of supply <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have said is that the cegb and the sseb are already free to import coal if they choose <e> <s> this freedom of choice will be retained by private generators after the privatisation of the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to ban imports of coal from south <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest of the noble lord lord dormand in coal mining in the north-east of england <e> <s> all i can say is that the closure of pits results from the restructuring of the industry to make it more competitive <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the imports of coal <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall draw my right honourable friends attention to the exchange of remarks today <e> <s> but i must emphasise that the government have given are giving and will continue to give steady support to british coals drive to restructure the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it affects price and competitiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is referring to the process of the gasification of coal <e> <s> rd is being conducted into this area and we await the outcome with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence is the interest which is being generated <e> <s> it is demonstrated by the fact that in the united states commercial companies are showing themselves willing to start the generation of electricity in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no decisions have yet been taken on the consultants report <e> <s> however no doubt the noble viscounts remarks will be taken into account when the decision is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his confidence <e> <s> as the committee correctly notes and as was particularly pointed out by the noble and gallant lord lord carver and repeated by many of your lordships the changing picture of nuclear research and development will have a considerable effect on the united kingdom atomic energy authority <e> <s> i am very happy to have this opportunity to acknowledge the important contribution that the authority has made and continues to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and to my noble friend lord selkirk for their welcome of this bill <e> <s> i am also very happy to hear that both noble lords have historical connections with brunei and especially to hear of the welsh connection <e> <s> i can certainly supply my noble friend with a little more detail as regards which appeals are envisaged under the new arrangement if that is helpful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a valuable debate <e> <s> your lordships have raised important points and made contributions based on long experience of the issues <e> <s> my noble friend lord trefgarne has already stated the governments case and in winding up i shall endeavour to respond to some of the points that have been raised <e> <s> however before i do so i should like briefly to refer to the context of nato and what it has already achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps have intervened earlier when the noble lord lord ezra referred to the position of renewables in the non-fossil fuel obligation <e> <s> i made the point that we propose to bring forward an amendment following the announcement by my right honourable friend the secretary of state that there would be a safeguarded position for renewables within the non-fossil fuel obligation <e> <s> that covers the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to confirm or deny what the prime minister may or may not do or say on friday <e> <s> as to the relevant part of the supplementary question perhaps i may say that of course we are concerned with the environment <e> <s> it is an important part of the nuclear industrys projected future that nuclear energy is in many ways beneficial to the environment in a way that fossil fuels are not <e> <s> that relates to the greenhouse effect <e> <s> nevertheless as the noble lord knows from previous occasions when we have discussed this subject the governments response is that there is not one solution to the greenhouse effect and environmental problems <e> <s> we are taking into account the effects of energy efficiency and conservation as well as the nuclear programme in our plans <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the cost of nuclear energy has always been there <e> <s> what has happened recently is that the public have become more aware of the cost and that is largely as a result of our privatisation proposals <e> <s> i have no doubt that the economics of the case figure as an important factor in any public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal to be said for the view expressed by the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> i simply reiterate that the governments attitude is that the solution to both our future energy requirements and to many of the environmental problems facing us is that we should have a package of a broad and diverse supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave my noble friend to speculate on that <e>", "<cs> my lords pwr technology is a well tried economic and efficient means of nuclear generation <e> <s> the case for pwrs was exhaustively discussed and examined in the course of the sizewell inquiry <e> <s> i think it is clear that pwr technology is the right solution in view of some of the difficulties that have arisen over the agr programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the capacity now being generated in scotland <e> <s> nevertheless the scientific arguments and the advisability of going for the pressurised water reactor programme have been well considered and discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords each application for a power station is treated on its merits <e> <s> i am certainly aware that the cegb submitted an application on th april for consent to construct a pwr station at wylfa but i am not aware of any further direct applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there must always be some sort of geographical influence as the processes of public inquiries have shown that there are local reactions to proposals in a particular area <e> <s> i believe that that and considerations of supply are among the criteria taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords to be a little more specific the relevant rules are the electricity generating stations and overhead lines inquiries procedure rules of and statutory instrument no <e> <s> of <e> <s> i realise that that does not necessarily help the noble lord but clearly the effect of the public inquiries that have already taken place particularly the sizewell b inquiry which was extremely lengthy will have some bearing on the length of subsequent inquiries into pwrs because many of the general arguments will already have been satisfied and discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a great scientist therefore i take the advice of experts <e> <s> experts have been consulted in this matter and as i said the sizewell b inquiry went thoroughly into all the arguments <e> <s> i can say that pwrs are well tried in other parts of the world and have proved to be an effective and economic method of producing nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his suggestion and invitation <e> <s> no <e>", "<cs> my lords in the governments proposals contained in the electricity bill non-fossil fuel obligation is intended to provide security of supply as a result of encouraging diversity of supply <e> <s> in that respect we are not speaking only of nuclear power but also of the renewable forms of energy which the obligation will encourage <e> <s> the distribution companies on whom the obligation will rest will not be restricted in any way in meeting that obligation <e> <s> as to the points raised by the noble lord concerning energy efficiency and public inquiries there is of course nothing to prevent these matters being raised as evidence in the course of a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble and learned friend that the important objective in all this is to keep the lights on <e> <s> we have to ensure that these factors are taken into account both in terms of supplying electricity and any other methods that are taken to make the production and use of electricity efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords greater efficiency with electricity can have two effects it can mean not only that less electricity is consumed but also that people demand higher standards of comfort in the use of their electricity <e> <s> therefore it does not necessarily mean that the level of production of electricity has to be lowered <e>", "<cs> perhaps as a start i should say that i have noted what the noble lord lord williams of elvel has said on the conduct of our proceedings <e> <s> i am pleased to have his assurances <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord for moving the amendment since it gives me a chance to explain how we see the role of the director and what sort of person is needed to fill this important post <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend should feel that <e> <s> however i believe that the comments of both the noble lord lord williams of elvel and my noble friend in no way detract from the argument i put forward that the amendment imposes a restriction upon choice <e>", "<cs> no i cannot <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i do not know it <e> <s> i said that i cannot tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i must say that i should have thought it obvious as my noble friend lord peyton said initially and as others have said that in looking for a suitable appointee the government will look to people who have experience of the industry <e> <s> there can be no question about that <e> <s> i am simply saying in responding to this amendment that we feel for the reasons which i believe the noble lord lord peston put quite admirably that it would be a restriction if for some reason such a person is not available <e> <s> on the question of salary the important point is as stated in the bill that the salary will be appropriate <e> <s> i am not in a position to discuss that further <e>", "<cs> that may be so but nevertheless it is also very relevant in the light of any negotiations that may take place now or in the future with any suitably qualified candidate <e> <s> therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss figures at this point <e>", "<cs> i recognise that these are probing amendments so i shall attempt to respond to the points raised by the noble lord <e> <s> with respect to amendment no <e> <s> as he said clause of the bill provides for the appointment of the director to be <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> however i simply reiterate that in view of the precedents for this provision in other forms of legislation its omission may leave doubt in certain peoples minds <e> <s> we feel therefore that it is preferable to follow the precedent <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord williams has explained the amendment seeks to establish poor performance of his functions as a criterion for the directors removal from office by the secretary of state <e> <s> in our view which concurs with that of my noble friend lord renton adequate provision is already made for this in the present wording of subsection <e> <s> that subsection enables the secretary of state to remove any person from <e>", "<cs> there is no question but that the main emphasis of this provision would bear on the failure of the individual to act in accordance with his duties under the bill <e> <s> however it is possible to envisage other circumstances where individuals through a course of conduct may cause a question to be raised as to suitability for continuing in office <e>", "<cs> i believe that i have already explained that <e> <s> i also pointed out that this is a precedented provision <e> <s> while i fully recognise that that does not make everything perfect in everyones view we can say from experience that it is a provision that has proved satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i can begin by agreeing with the noble lord lord williams of elvel that this is in all probability the first of a number of debates during <e>", "<cs> it is very kind of the noble lord to give me such an opportunity <e> <s> i too do not intend to repeat any of the arguments which i made in response to the initial debate <e> <s> however i should perhaps return to the issue raised by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon about the efficiency of the generators <e> <s> we believe that that point will be covered by the competition in generation to which our proposals will give rise <e> <s> clearly the efficiency with which a generator uses fuel will significantly affect its costs and therefore its ability to compete successfully <e> <s> that may also answer the concerns expressed by the noble lord lord williams about the duty to promote competition provided in clause <e> <s> i think that that is the main new area which has arisen at this point in committee <e>", "<cs> our proposals give consumers committees many powers but none of them relates to the appointment or dismissal of the director <e>", "<cs> the office of electricity regulation will be a non-ministerial government department <e> <s> it is entirely customary for all civil service manpower issues to be cleared with the treasury <e> <s> it would be completely wrong to ignore past precedents and seek to establish a new policy in that area <e>", "<cs> we currently have staff carrying out functions which will be carried out by the staff of the regulator for example meter examiners certain staff of the existing consumer bodies and so on <e> <s> they add up to about so the net increase <e>", "<cs> yes one could put it like that <e> <s> we should not like to be tied to any figure at this stage because obviously once the appointment of the director has taken place he may himself wish to take a view on the likely size and shape of the new organisation <e> <s> but at this stage those are the sort of numbers that we envisage <e>", "<cs> the procedures for reimbursement or a payment which is voted by parliament can involve parliamentary debate so there is opportunity for discussion in that sense <e> <s> however i hope that i have made it clear that although the costs will initially be voted by parliament they will not give rise to any expenditure because there will be reimbursement through the licence fees which will be set at such a level as to avoid expenditure <e> <s> it is therefore intended that the director general will be given all the resources that he needs to perform his duties <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> would my noble friend mind repeating what he said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just confirm that the point raised by my noble friend lord renton is correct <e> <s> there will be separate presentation of the accounts as the noble lord lord williams of elvel indicated <e> <s> i should also like to say that the reason for the provision and the requirement of treasury approval is that we believe it is necessary for normal public accountability procedures to be applied in view of the fact that the consumer is paying the ultimate bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may continue for a moment <e> <s> i should like to make clear in relation to the assurance that i gave to the noble lord lord stoddart that the director general will get all he needs not necessarily all he wants <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that it will be for the director general who is doing the job and is the best person to know his needs to set the levels that he thinks he will need <e> <s> the secretary of state through the public accountability procedures that we envisage with treasury consent will be available to ensure that those are truly his needs rather than his wants <e>", "<cs> i take the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that he had a problem <e> <s> the department had worked out certain suggestions for groupings which were waiting to be printed on the marshalled list in order to make them easily conveyable <e> <s> i regret that the usual methods through the usual channels seem to have resulted in this problem arriving on the noble lords lap rather late in the day <e>", "<cs> no it was later <e>", "<cs> noble lords have my every sympathy i am simply at a loss to understand why they did not receive our suggested groupings of amendments because it went much further than the groupings eventually agreed <e> <s> however i understand that it was because the noble lord lord shepherd was unavailable as the noble lord lord williams mentioned earlier that a grouping could not be agreed <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord shepherd said in introducing the amendment we discussed the subject fairly fully in connection with a previous amendment <e> <s> however it is an important topic and there is still plenty to say <e> <s> it was useful to hear the views of the select commmittee as the noble lord explained them <e> <s> in responding perhaps i may therefore begin with a few general remarks and for emphasis reiterate some of the points which i made last week <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> this is the condition relating to the public electricity supply companies licences <e> <s> in this amendment we are not talking about generating licences <e>", "<cs> i believe that those points were covered in some of my remarks and in our discussions last week <e> <s> certainly we believe that energy consumption increases as a result of economic growth but we can point i do not have the figures at my fingertips to the fact that as a result of energy efficiency measures that have already been incorporated consumption has not increased at the same rate as our economic growth <e> <s> so there is clearly an area where we can take action where we believe we are taking action and where we shall be capable of taking action <e> <s> as to the potential that could be achieved i think that that follows from my reply on that last point <e>", "<cs> i hope i am correct in thinking that in moving amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord was speaking also to the grouping which includes amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that in moving these amendments my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil wishes to alter the division of regulatory work between the director and the secretary of state by placing a greater proportion on the director <e> <s> at the same time he aims to reduce the directors independence from the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the views expressed by my noble friends <e> <s> i recognise that my noble friend lord peyton feels that the task of the director is extremely complex and that he seeks to restructure the relationship between the <e>", "<cs> in view of the pleas expressed from all sides of the chamber although i see no real possibility of changing our views because in our view my noble friends amendment drives a coach and horses through the governments proposals i am prepared to take it back to look at it again and to read the comments that have been made <e> <s> however that must be an agreement without commitment <e>", "<cs> the grouping list which i have also includes amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble viscount the grouping which i understood was agreed on this is amendments nos <e> <s> a and a <e>", "<cs> these three amendments concern consumer interests and these are important duties <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with amendment no <e> <s> which was moved by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> clause a requires the secretary of state and the director to exercise their functions in the manner which each considers to be best calculated to protect the interests of consumers of electricity supplied by persons authorised by licences <e>", "<cs> clause b is well precedented <e> <s> there are in fact similar provisions in the gas act and in the telecommunications act <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> the noble viscount lord hanworth was concerned lest cowboys should receive licences <e> <s> i should also be concerned if i thought that that was a real danger <e> <s> however i do not really think that it is <e>", "<cs> for the reasons which i have given i believe that the actual or potential insolvency of a licensed successor company is of the remotest possibility <e> <s> however in the case that the contingency should arise then of course normal insolvency law would apply as it would to previously privatised industries such as british telecom and british gas <e>", "<cs> am most grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe because there are of course general external safeguards which would apply equally to the public electricity supply companies <e> <s> however in addition the director will monitor the companys behaviour indeed that is one of his duties <e> <s> if necessary he could take the company for example to the monopolies and mergers commisson or to some other external body as may be appropriate <e>", "<cs> i recognise the point of the suggestion made by the noble lord lord peston that we should start dealing now with matters which we would naturally be dealing with at a later stage of our discussions on the bill <e> <s> however if it is agreeable to members of the committee i should prefer to leave such detailed discussion until that time <e>", "<cs> in relation to amendment no <e> <s> i should explain how our proposals will encourage competition in generation and supply <e> <s> by competition in generation i am not talking merely about the competition between national power and power gen the two companies which will inherit the generating capacity of the cegb <e> <s> our proposals will open up exciting new opportunities for independent private generators and will give all types of generator new rights to put them on an equal footing with the successors to the cegb and the area boards <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting exchange of views and i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for having prompted it by his as he admitted probing amendment <e> <s> there is no disagreement about the objective of seeking to protect the environment to the maximum extent which is reasonably practical when electricity developments are undertaken <e> <s> the difference such as it is is about the approach and method <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to confirm once again that there is absolutely no intention of doing away with the energy efficiency office <e> <s> it does a very valuable job and we are very concerned in ensuring in every way possible that it does an effective job not only a cost effective job <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that we had discussed this amendment earlier with amendments nos <e> <s> and outlined at that time the governments view that the provisions of the bill on the efficient use of electricity and on safety cover the problem which the noble viscount seeks further to cover <e> <s> in the light of the remarks made earlier i hope that the noble viscount will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i regret that no other members of the committee are prepared to take part in this interesting duologue which is about to develop <e> <s> i start my responses by thanking the noble lord lord peston for his kind suggestion that where matters of detail and complexity are so great in order to respond adequately to them it would require a study of <e>", "<cs> the flotation arrangements for the company which will come into force after the company has been formed and after the licence has been agreed will take into account the fact that the company is in possession of the licence <e> <s> that may help the noble lord <e> <s> it will be the transfer day <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether the licences were subject to litigation <e> <s> enforcement of licence conditions is described in clauses to of the bill <e> <s> basically the director issues enforcement orders <e>", "<cs> the licences cannot be transferred from one company to another <e> <s> however as the noble lord said a licensee might be the subject of a takeover bid <e> <s> such a proposed merger would be subject to normal takeover law and practices and could be referred to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> so there is a control over the situation <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head just as i was shaking mine when he raised the questions on the formulae <e> <s> again i reiterate that i shall take up his offer to write to him in some instances regarding matters which i may not be able to cover now since this is a complicated subject to someone like myself who does not speak the language of mathematics <e> <s> i believe that to those who speak and understand the language of mathematics all is much clearer <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i fully agree with the noble viscount lord hanworth that heat generated with electricity is an important potential source of energy <e> <s> i should like to add that this government have done more than any other to promote energy efficiency in all its forms <e> <s> the potential for combined heat and power which can effectively utilise up to per cent of the fuel used compared with to per cent in conventional power stations has long been recognised by the government <e> <s> this is why the department of energy has funded an extensive programme to establish the potential for chp both on a city-wide and a local basis <e>", "<cs> the government are committed to increased and sustained energy efficiency including sensible demand management <e> <s> perhaps i should also refer to the fact as the noble lord lord williams is no doubt aware that electricity demand <e>", "<cs> of course the government are concerned about pensioners and disabled people <e> <s> nevertheless the provisions in the bill place a duty upon the secretary of state or the director to take <e>", "<cs> i do of course look sympathetically at this question <e> <s> the government share the view of all noble lords who have contributed to the discussion about the importance of research and development particularly in the energy sector <e> <s> however i cannot agree with my noble friend lord lauderdale that he received an inadequate reply from my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden at second reading <e>", "<cs> i hope to be able to demonstrate that the government have no intention of getting it wrong <e>", "<cs> i shall not quibble with my noble friend about this although i believe that the oil industry is looking far into the future and indeed the export market as well in the research that it is developing <e> <s> however since my noble friend also referred earlier in somewhat slighting terms to acord i must fulful his prophecy by saying that he may be interested to hear that last week acord considered the electricity supply industrys rd programme in order to advise the secretary of state about the implications of the changes that are taking place <e> <s> acord concluded that while it would take some time for the full implications of privatisation for rd to work through the industrys proposals <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has made perfectly clear what his major worry is <e> <s> however perhaps i may continue <e> <s> we believe that there is no reason why the present arrangements should not continue to work well in the future after privatisation <e> <s> in this sense therefore there is nothing between the government and those who have sponsored this amendment <e>", "<cs> what i have said is that the government will consider the question to see whether a government amendment could be brought forward at the report stage <e> <s> i believe that we should be able to do that in consultation with the proposers of the amendment <e> <s> we hope that we may be able to satisfy their concerns and to overcome the difficulties in drafting that this amendment has suggested to us <e>", "<cs> in the usual way on these occasions i make that comment without commitment but in reading what i have said i believe the noble lord will be able to draw the necessary conclusion <e>", "<cs> i must confess some puzzlement concerning the purpose of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> if its purpose is to bring the provisions of clause of the bill into effect throughout the united kingdom this amendment does not achieve that <e> <s> the amendment would apparently make it an offence to generate electricity in northern ireland without a licence or exemption <e> <s> however it does not attempt to make it an offence to transmit or supply electricity in northern ireland without a licence or exemption <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may turn to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> this is not an xenophobic bill <e> <s> foreign companies may for example apply for these licences <e> <s> it is however totally contrary to accepted principles of international law for the legislature of one state or for some authority within that state to say what conduct is or is not to be a criminal offence in another state which would be the effect of amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> that appears to make it possible for persons to generate transmit or supply electricity if licensed to do so by another member state of the ec <e>", "<cs> i trust that i am right in thinking that in proposing amendment no <e> <s> c the noble lord was also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> starting with amendment no <e> <s> c i should explain that the electricity licences do two things <e> <s> they enable suitable obligations to be placed on licensees for example to ensure that their operations are carried out in accordance with appropriate technical standards <e> <s> these obligations are vital regardless of who owns the lines through which the electricity is sent <e> <s> but licences also confer <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that reference to persons of a particular class does not refer in any way to social status but to the small operators that i referred to in my reply <e> <s> it could be said that specified groups of persons might be rather difficult to interpret so i trust that he will be able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have already agreed to take back a previous amendment on research and development perhaps i need not deal with the general question of research that arises on this amendment <e> <s> as to the other limb of the amendment regarding support for the smaller private generators the prospects for small scale electricity projects are not quite as unpromising as to require grants of the kind the amendment suggests <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the noble lord lord peston that it is of vital importance that security of supply should be maintained <e> <s> we believe that our proposals ensure that because under the licence the director will already be responsible for among other things ensuring that electricity suppliers have proper forward plans for contracting adequate capacity <e> <s> he is also responsible under the bill for implementing standards of performance to be achieved by public electricity suppliers and perhaps most fundamentally for ensuring that public electricity suppliers meet their basic obligation to supply <e> <s> the director has powers under clause of the bill to ensure that those conditions and statutory requirements are fully met by licence holders <e> <s> i trust that that goes some way to reassuring the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount said we have been into the arguments on combined heat and power <e> <s> i believe that the provisions of clause will ensure that energy efficiency which will include in some cases chp schemes is properly taken into account <e> <s> i must reiterate that we believe that it is quite wrong to require any industry to act uncommercially <e> <s> our approach of encouraging competition and leaving consumers to make their own well informed decisions is likely to produce the best results <e> <s> i therefore regret that i cannot at this point accept the amendment of the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that we heartily welcome any intention of transferring <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that everybody in the government joins me in agreeing with that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we agree that we are certainly moving in the right direction <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware two sets of negotiations are currently under way on conventional forces in europe between members of nato and the warsaw pact and on confidence-building measures with members of csce both of which began on th march this year <e> <s> i can report that the atmosphere so far is most cordial and workmanlike <e> <s> progress is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer back to the answer that i gave to the previous question <e> <s> i should have thought that the wholly constructive attitude of the two sets of negotiations which are currently going on in relation to conventional forces must be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is a different matter rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as we understand it the soviet aim is the denuclearisation of europe <e> <s> that was the argument put forward recently by mr gorbachev <e> <s> for nato we believe that snf for example remains an essential element of deterrence <e> <s> given this conceptual difference in objectives we see no prospect for a fruitful outcome to any arms control negotiations which assume total denuclearisation and forget that element of deterrence <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said we recognise the monumental task that mr gorbachev has ahead of him <e> <s> as i have said we can only welcome the intention to transfer military spending to the civilian sector <e> <s> we can only hope that an adequate outcome will result from all the negotiations that are taking place <e> <s> however it is an interesting fact that the figures that have been put forward by the warsaw pact countries recently are higher than the estimates that we already had <e>", "<cs> my lords the arab league negotiators helped bring about a ceasefire on th may <e> <s> despite sporadic shelling of the coastline and tragic incidents such as the assassination of the mufti on th may this ceasefire appears generally to be holding <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that all those involved in the current fighting including syria should agree in the first place to an immediate ceasefire <e> <s> we also believe that the israelis should withdraw fully from lebanon and allow unifil the united nations interim force in lebanon to deploy to the international border in accordance with the united nations security council recommendation no <e> <s> <e> <s> we believe that the israeli presence in lebanon is provocative and destabilising and not in israels own long-term interests <e> <s> i cannot inform my noble friend what is on the agenda of the discussions with the israeli prime minister but i have little doubt that this will be one of the items <e>", "<cs> my lords we acknowledge the extensive work which has been carried out by the committee of six of the arab league <e> <s> indeed it is that committee which nursed into being the ceasefire of th may which despite sporadic firing and the latest car bomb incident on th may is generally holding <e> <s> we believe that the arab league should be allowed a free hand in consolidating this achievement <e> <s> the noble lord may be aware that there is an extraordinary arab league summit meeting scheduled for later this week in morocco <e> <s> i have no doubt that lebanon will be high on the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we support any realistic attempt to achieve a durable negotiated settlement which will lead to the restoration of peace full sovereignty independence territoral integrity and nationality unity of the lebanon <e> <s> however we believe that in the present situation it is important to allow and enable the arab league to persevere in the work it is doing in this respect <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to make any pronouncement on the lines which the noble earl has suggested <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> perhaps i can supplement what i said earlier by saying that we are committed to the united nations interim force in maintaining stability in southern lebanon <e> <s> obviously we continue to support that approach as well as awaiting a further outcome from the arab league <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we have already done so <e> <s> through the european community we have expressed full backing for the arab league in its efforts to achieve a political solution <e> <s> we and other members of the twelve stand ready to help in whatever way is thought helpful <e> <s> we have issued several statements to that effect both unilaterally and together with the united states and our partners in the european community <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we shall continue to work for peaceful and durable solutions to regional disputes in the middle east particularly in lebanon and to play our part both bilaterally and through international organisations in helping to relieve the suffering of those involved in the conflicts in the region <e>", "<cs> my lords the circumstances on the ground make the provision of direct aid difficult <e> <s> that is why first of all we have called on all parties to agree to a negotiated ceasefire <e> <s> then we shall know exactly what work needs to be done and can work with our partners to relieve the suffering <e> <s> we all acknowledge the devoted work of dr <e> <s> cutting and others who in similar difficult circumstances do their best to help the people who are suffering as a result of the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already brought this to the notice of the israeli government and will continue to take such steps as they feel are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> no i am sorry the second question on this subject does say elsewhere in the middle east <e> <s> i was going to add <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there is a difficulty in making calculations in that we do not have any specific figures on which to base our calculations <e> <s> in his guildhall speech on th april mr gorbachev claimed that figures would be published shortly and that the delay was caused by problems arising from the non-convertability of the rouble <e> <s> we are hoping that some concrete figures will be published shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards specific matters nato is calling for parity between the two alliances in particular categories of equipment such as tanks artillery and armoured troop carriers within the whole of europe from the atlantic to the urals <e> <s> we are also proposing limits on the size of the armed forces of any individual country and on the numbers of forces which can be stationed outside national territories <e> <s> the figures outlined by mr gorbachev more recently on th may during the visit of the united states secretary of state mr baker show a response in detail to natos proposals <e> <s> i believe i mentioned those figures yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords we are taking that statement seriously <e> <s> we know that the whole matter of defence spending in the soviet union is under review <e> <s> however as yet we have no independent corroboration of any figures that have been put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is a matter in respect of which we do not have any independent corroboration of the details <e> <s> on chemical weapons we are active in our negotiations in geneva for a comprehensive verifiable worldwide ban <e> <s> however this is a complex issue particularly in the area of verification <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is one of our difficulties <e> <s> as i said until we have more specific <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another of our difficulties <e> <s> unless we know the method of calculation used by both the soviet union and the warsaw pact countries we cannot comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have made it quite clear that we welcome any move to reduce both defence spending and arms production in the soviet union and warsaw pact countries <e> <s> that has been made very clear <e> <s> i should like to confirm it further by emphasising that we welcome the advances that have been made <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is why we have been pressing for parity <e> <s> the figures that i referred to outlined by mr gorbachev on th may are a step in the right direction but we envisage that reduction to those levels will take some six years or so <e> <s> however the soviet acceptance especially of the tank figures is a major step forward and indeed a vindication of our approach in pressing for parity <e>", "<cs> my lords figures such as those quoted by my noble friend lord orr-ewing about the comparative numbers of offensive armaments speak for themselves <e> <s> we are making cuts and not only at the two meetings which are currently taking place in vienna but also at the approaching nato summit we shall no doubt be looking at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with that sentiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the government are taking every step available to them to show a more open spirit <e> <s> i say only that in relation to arms reduction this is tempered with a little caution <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i am sure that they are very conservative in their approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord goes a little far in saying that every other nato country wishes to negotiate <e> <s> there are two main areas where we believe that we have a case to argue <e> <s> the first is modification <e> <s> the noble lord is well aware that the alliance has agreed that for the foreseeable future there is no alternative to a strategy of deterrence based on an effective mix of nuclear and conventional forces which will be kept up to date where necessary <e> <s> the other area is the possibility of seeking agreement on equal ceilings <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in close touch with our allies on this matter <e> <s> the purpose is of course to reach an agreement acceptable to all <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said our intention in attending the nato summit next week is to reach an agreement that is acceptable to all members of the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion on the table is that the soviet union should reduce the number of its nuclear weapons in europe unilaterally to nato levels <e> <s> so far it has undertaken to cut only out of short-range missile systems <e> <s> as i said the nato capability is <e> <s> so it is a minimal reduction which we believe is not worthy of serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords nato has already reduced its stockpile of nuclear warheads in europe by per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> the implementation of the inf treaty will result in further reductions and modernisation of natos nuclear weapons will allow still further cuts in the stockpile <e> <s> so i should not like to agree at all that we are trailing behind <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an important point in relation to the modernisation of the soviet capability <e> <s> i agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may be quite right <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> operationally it makes sense to have the most flexible survival systems <e> <s> it is to that end that we are pursuing our negotiations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by referring to the very good safety record of civil nuclear installations in the united kingdom <e> <s> that very much reflects the dedication skill and painstaking care which the many thousands of workers in the nuclear industry bring to this aspect of their job <e> <s> anybody who has had the opportunity to visit a nuclear power plant as i have will recognise that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to my noble friend and reiterate what i said earlier <e> <s> over the past two years in response to the anxieties that have been expressed as a direct result of the chernobyl accident the nii has been substantially strengthened and its staff levels increased by over per cent <e> <s> i also said that further expansion is planned <e> <s> whether the nii is directing its attention to the public sector or to the private sector is neither here nor there <e> <s> it will still impose its standards in the same rigorous way <e> <s> the inspectors will still be able to require operators whether in the public or the private sector to make improvements to the design or operation of a station if that is required <e> <s> as i said if necessary the inspectors can require a station to be closed down <e> <s> i do not know what further action my noble friend thinks is possible <e>", "<cs> i believe that at an earlier stage in the committees discussions we touched on the question of whether the director general has or should have the power to vary or revoke a licence <e> <s> this point arose on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clause enables the director to modify the conditions of a licence only if the licensee consents <e> <s> the director is obliged under the clause to publish notice of his proposals and to allow a period for representations and objections <e> <s> that is his duty in bringing the matter to the attention of the public or persons likely to be affected <e> <s> he then waits but i do not regard that as being a passive way of carrying the matter forward <e>", "<cs> i shall be delighted to try to clarify the point further <e> <s> certainly the representations and objections considered would be in relation to the specific modification although as i continued to say no one can stop a person from making general representations if he or she wishes to do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by saying how sorry i am that despite the interest which my noble friend lord peyton has shown as regards the appointment of the director general of electricity supply he seems to have missed the announcement which was made on nd may <e> <s> the appointment subject to parliaments approval of the electricity bill has in fact been made <e> <s> professor stephen littlechild is the designated director general <e> <s> i can of course arrange for my noble friend to receive a copy of the press release which goes into considerably more detail <e>", "<cs> it would clarify the position if we were to deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> i understood my noble friend to be speaking only to amendment no <e> <s> so i responded in the light of that <e> <s> it is important to bear in mind that although he takes away the secretary of states power to block in amendment no <e> <s> my noble friend then gives the power of referral to the secretary of state in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> if the committee so wishes i am happy to stick to amendment no <e> <s> and to respond to the questions asked about where it is envisaged that the power would be used and why we therefore believe that it is necessary <e> <s> although the secretary of state and the director are subject to the same duties under clause the secretary of state will nevertheless always have his perception of the requirements of the wider national interest <e> <s> that may lead him to form a view different from that of the director although as i said in my initial response i believe that that is highly unlikely <e>", "<cs> on that latter point i should say to members of the committee that the information was released in answer to a parliamentary question and appeared in <e>", "<cs> i apologise to anybody who feels that the announcement was in any way attempted in an underhand manner <e> <s> i believe that it was made through the normal parliamentary method <e> <s> the anouncement was made on nd may <e> <s> if i have it right that was the monday of the week before the recess began so it was in the public domain before both houses as it were went to sleep <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am unable to satisfy my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls on <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perfectly right in the assumption that the general powers of the secretary of state are not affected <e> <s> this provision exists to deal with those cases where the director has been unable to reach agreement on licence modifications with the licensee <e>", "<cs> in view of the wider issues which have been raised i should say that it is the governments policy that the electricity industry as we propose to recognise it should be fully subject to competition law <e> <s> by competition law i mean mainly the fair trading act the restrictive trade practices act and the competition act <e> <s> there will have to be some exemptions but we intend that those should so far as possible be transitional in nature <e> <s> we shall no doubt go into more detail on this later when the committee discusses later clauses of the bill particularly clauses and <e>", "<cs> under clause the director will have a duty to investigate any complaint which deals with any of the public electricity suppliers duties or obligations under the bill or licence that is an enforcement matter which might require the director to consider taking action under clauses to of the bill <e> <s> the consumers committees must refer any complaint which appears to them to be an enforcement matter to the director while the director is able to delegate his duty under this clause to a consumers committee and require it to investigate and report to him on an enforcement matter <e>", "<cs> i regret that the noble lord lord peston without having had full details and information of the appointment of professor littlechild and the noble lord acknowledged that should feel able to denounce him in advance <e>", "<cs> we believe that he is admirably qualified for the post <e> <s> he has had extensive experience of regulatory issues both in the united kingdom and abroad he has worked on the regulatory regime for british telecom and in fact he has been a member of the monopolies and mergers commission for six years <e> <s> he has a wide knowledge of regulatory systems both here and in the united states of america <e> <s> his job will be primarily regulating the industry and that experience will therefore be invaluable <e>", "<cs> we believe that this is an important matter <e> <s> that is why the power has been given to the secretary of state to make these appointments <e> <s> as i said it is most probable that the appointments will involve people who have a specific knowledge of the electricity industry <e> <s> however that should not be essential for all members <e>", "<cs> the present wording of this clause gives the director a degree of discretion in the licence modifications that are to be made <e> <s> it is this element of discretion that these amendments seek to remove <e> <s> it seems to me to make sense that he should not be bound to the small print of the modifications specified in the report since he will have the expertise to decide the best wording of the modifications necessary to remedy or prevent the effects adverse to the public interest that have been identified <e> <s> therefore i think that there is a value in the wording and i regret that i fail to be persuaded by my noble friends arguments <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord that the appointment of director general of electricity supply will be a very full-time job for professor littlechild <e> <s> it is in that light that he has accepted it <e> <s> i should say further that as well as the admirable general qualifications to which i referred and to which the noble lord lord dean has now added professor littlechild has also been advising the secretary of state on electricity privatisation since so he has an extremely good background knowledge of what is involved in the job <e> <s> he will as i said be regarding it as a full-time job and he <e>", "<cs> i believe that he would have to yes <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to follow the argument that disagrees with a provision which enables the director in making any modifications following a report to have some freedom in the precise wording of the modifications that he makes <e> <s> he should not have to follow the precise wording of the monopolies and mergers commissions report <e> <s> but as there seems to be considerable confusion now as a result of our discussion on this amendment perhaps it would be best if i read the arguments that have been put forward and come back later <e>", "<cs> i shall try to give an explanation but if it does not go far enough i shall endeavour to supplement it by writing to the noble lord <e> <s> the previous three clauses deal with modification of licences in circumstances where a particular matter relating to the generation transmission or supply of electricity is referred to the monopolies and mergers commission and is found to operate against the public interest <e> <s> the purport of clause is to provide for modification of a licence following a report from the monopolies and mergers commission under other legislation about a monopolies or merger reference or an anti-competitive practice relating to the generation transmission or supply of electricity <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston explained the purpose in introducing this amendment and that is a purpose which the government share <e> <s> that is why we have made specific provision in clause of the bill to establish what charges the supplier can recover from the consumer in respect of making a connection <e> <s> the clause makes clear that the consumer may be required to defray only the expenses reasonably incurred in providing the supply to such extent as is reasonable in the circumstances <e> <s> thus there is already a reasonableness criterion applied to what expenses can be incurred in providing the connection <e>", "<cs> i believe that what should help greatly in arriving at a determination of what is reasonable in all the circumstances is the transparency of costs <e> <s> i believe that it is probably inevitable that not only consumers but also consumer committees will look at costs on a comparative basis <e> <s> of course they will need to show that they are comparing like with like and i believe that that covers the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed it will be open to the consumer to bring those circumstances to the attention of the director <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate but it is important to establish that the purpose of this information is to enable the supplier <e>", "<cs> perhaps i did not express myself sufficiently clearly when i explained that it was common practice currently for area boards to help consumers in estimating their consumption whether they are domestic or industrial consumers <e> <s> from <e>", "<cs> i raised this as a personal problem and said that i had never been asked for such information <e> <s> i would find it difficult to produce unaided details of my maximum requirements <e> <s> i am told that is why the procedure has evolved <e> <s> i understand from people who have recently moved home that they are supplied with a checklist and asked to complete it <e> <s> whatever the mechanics are i would not wish to get distracted too much from the main issue <e> <s> suffice it to say that i had hoped to explain that it is in the interests of the supply company to help to obtain the right kind of figure in terms of maximum demand <e> <s> that is for the reasons that i have stated as regards its own needs for contracting supplies as well as for the types of connections lines and pipes that would be required <e>", "<cs> we have to try to strike a proper balance <e> <s> we clearly want to make things easier for the average consumer not just the domestic consumer but it must be taken in the context that clause places a specific duty on the public electricity supplier to supply electricity on request to any premises within his authorised area <e> <s> the effect of this is to give all owners and occupiers of premises the right to require a supply and therefore there is the duty on the supplier to produce it <e> <s> that has to be taken within certain limits of expectation <e> <s> the supplier and the consumer between them have to agree what they think will be the maximum supply <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have been unable to convince the noble lord <e> <s> there are obviously two schools of thought <e> <s> it seems to me that by accepting the amendment or even agreeing to take it back i would not necessarily be helping the domestic consumer <e> <s> we have to ensure that the domestic consumer is helped through the advice of the public electricity supply companies and the advice given by the consumer committees so that a sensible solution can be arrived at for the maximum supply required <e> <s> as i said at the outset we are talking about a maximum figure <e> <s> it will not oblige the consumer to consume up to that amount <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the reasons given by the noble lord lord ezra for introducing the amendments <e> <s> however i must say that i do not believe that they will achieve what he sets out to achieve <e> <s> in so far as the public electricity supplier is exempted from the need to provide a supply to premises which are already receiving supplies from someone else down his lines then it cannot be unreasonable to withhold a supply <e> <s> we do however understand the anxieties expressed by the noble lord and indeed we have already taken steps to meet such anxieties <e> <s> perhaps it would assist members of the committee if i were to explain some of them <e>", "<cs> plc literally means a public limited company <e>", "<cs> that means that the shares are owned by the public <e> <s> nevertheless the name public electricity supplier as defined in the bill relating to what we now call the area boards refers to those people who will have a duty to supply the public <e> <s> that is the reason for the name <e>", "<cs> i believe that i gave the answer to this particular issue by referring to the terms of the licence which will require a public electricity supplier to provide top-up or stand-by supplies to the individual generator <e> <s> in this clause we are talking about a duty to supply the end customer or consumer <e> <s> it seems unfair if the consumer chooses to use some other supplier which he is perfectly entitled to do and which we wish to encourage him to do that the public electricity supplier should also have the duty to supply that consumer <e> <s> since any gap that exists will be made up under the licence arrangements which will be enforceable there is no problem or at least there should be no problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that electricity imported from france is competitive with that produced in large coal-fired power stations in the uk <e> <s> that is in part due to the fact that it is an interruptible supply <e> <s> however the detailed pricing arrangements are commercially confidential to the utilities concerned <e> <s> i emphasise that the link is used to supply electricity not only at peak times but at other times as well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the same question as that on the order paper <e> <s> however i am aware that investigations are being carried out on routeing and any necessary reinforcement which may be required to upgrade the scottish inter-connector to provide for a potential increase in capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords the balance is in favour of imports from france <e> <s> in we exported gigawatt hours <e>", "<cs> my lords the current contract between the cegb and electricit de france is due to expire at the end of this year <e> <s> that contract is currently being renegotiated by the national grid division of the cegb <e> <s> i am unaware of other separate negotiations but it is open to the industry to negotiate direct <e>", "<cs> my lords no not without notice <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have contributed to this discussion <e> <s> as i said my intention was to provide a little background to a number of government amendments which have been grouped together <e> <s> i hope that the committee will appreciate that in the long run that will shorten the debates on many individual amendments <e>", "<cs> the point is that the reprocessing costs extend over a very long period and many of those costs which relate particularly to the magnox stations and certainly the decommissioning costs only berkeley has already been closed as i said are costs which will arise in the future <e> <s> there is also the cost relating to maintaining the capacity which in phasing out magnox will have to be replaced by the new system of pwrs that is the capital investment cost related to that <e>", "<cs> i agree that it is an important matter <e> <s> perhaps i may point to paragraph of the white paper on privatising electricity <e> <s> it specifically refers to sources from scotland france the atomic energy authority and bnfl <e> <s> that is why i made that specific reference in my opening remarks <e> <s> it should not come as a total surprise that we had looked to those sources as part of the contribution to the diversity of supply <e> <s> but there can be no doubt that in setting the obligation as will be necessary at the beginning of the process that obligation will be set to cover the existing uk capacity <e> <s> in so doing there will have to be proof of contractual arrangements to ensure that the obligation is fulfilled from the public electricity supply companies with stations that will include the english and welsh plants <e> <s> the contracts will of course be with national power which will have the ownership of those assets <e> <s> there is therefore a contractual safeguard on top <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may write to my noble friend on that point <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick and my noble friend for clarifying that point <e> <s> i should have made the clarification myself <e> <s> i agree entirely that there is absolutely no proof of the assertion that the noble lord lord hatch made in this respect <e>", "<cs> in theory that is so <e> <s> however we know that in practice there are insufficient available renewable sources but we hope that they will continue to improve and grow <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to members of the committee who have welcomed this group of amendments <e> <s> i shall endeavour to reply to the specific questions that have been raised <e> <s> we do not use the word renewables because some forms of generation such as waste-derived fuel or rubbish burning do not legally count as a renewable fuel <e> <s> nevertheless we should wish to embrace it as a non-fossil fuel generating station <e>", "<cs> we most certainly have sympathy with the explanations given and the reasons behind the amendments put forward by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i can readily understand why they should have an initial appeal to so many members of the committee <e> <s> perhaps i may try to show why we believe that they are not necessary and indeed might prove difficult <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and indeed to my noble friend <e> <s> i was coming on to talk a little more about energy efficiency although i appreciate that we debated it very fully at an earlier stage and that an amendment on the matter was passed by the committee <e>", "<cs> our difficulty as regards this amendment is the fact that although we are grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for his explanation of the system and indeed i am a great supporter of chp as the noble lord knows it is not a form of primary energy in itself it is a process of conversion designed to make the most of the primary fuels used to generate electricity and heat <e> <s> as such chp can be applied to any fuel which raises heat to generate electricity whether non-fossil or fossil <e> <s> electricity generated from chp schemes will as i said count towards the obligation when the fuel upon which it <e>", "<cs> we also believe that the bill provides an opportunity and that is why as i tried to say we have endeavoured to create a legislative framework which would enable chp to compete effectively <e> <s> i say to my noble friend lord lauderdale that we are not turning our backs on the question <e> <s> we promote the use of chp in the various ways that i have described <e> <s> we have created a proper framework within which it can operate <e> <s> to try to include it within the non-fossil fuel obligation is like comparing apples with pears <e>", "<cs> i recognise that we have already touched upon this subject in relation to earlier amendments <e> <s> however i should again like to make clear that ever since the white paper the government have said that imports will be capable of contributing to the non-fossil fuel obligation in the same way as nuclear capacity from bnfl the atomic energy authority and scotland and renewable capacity <e> <s> the nffo is not intended only to support national powers nuclear programme <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may go on to explain the existing supplies which we obtain from outside the uk the only existing outside supplies being through the cross-channel link from france and how those are affected <e> <s> my noble friend lord hood referred to the fact that in the past the cegb has been supplied under a protocol and an associated electricity supply agreement <e> <s> in future it will be the public electricity suppliers rather than the generators who will contract for the power <e> <s> that is the point which the noble lord lord peston has just made in relation to the obligation to supply <e> <s> the sort of contract that they will negotiate may well be different from the uk non-fossil contracts in many significant respects <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to replace the non-fossil fuel obligation with a duty on the public electricity suppliers to take measures to ensure that their fuel sources and generation technologies are adequate to ensure that the long-term security of supply of their customers is protected as the noble lord lord peston has explained <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> the levy will be smaller than it will be at the outset when we have the cost of the magnoxes to take into account <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i can usefully add to these arguments that i put forward in proposing the amendment in the first place <e> <s> as the noble lord has said we shall be returning to this argument again <e> <s> i therefore commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be able to agree with the noble lord lord williams of elvel in saying that he is wise to seek to ensure that regulations made under this clause are subject to parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> i am pleased to assure him that this has been provided for <e> <s> to be precise clause provides that any regulations made by the secretary of state under the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to pre-empt further discussion on this important amendment but i think that it may be helpful to the committee if i speak at this stage <e>", "<cs> taking the energy conservation point perhaps i should say that when the amendment was passed it was acknowledged by the noble lord lord shepherd to be flawed and possibly to need some drafting alterations <e> <s> it is in that context that discussions are going on but obviously we are looking at it in the overall picture <e> <s> this is an area where we must meet the arguments that have been put forward with a package of solutions <e> <s> indeed we started the process with the package that was introduced previously <e> <s> however i thought that in making my initial response i had indicated the two areas where we had the possibility of negotiating <e>", "<cs> no we are endeavouring to make the decision effective which because of the flaw to which i referred it is not at the moment <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best <e> <s> i should like to clarify for the record that we are talking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i dare start by reminding members of the committee that the formulation in the bill is well precedented in the gas act the telecommunications act and indeed the fair trading act <e>", "<cs> i regret that the repetition of certain questions unfortunately calls for a rather similar response in some respects <e> <s> perhaps i may start with amendment no <e> <s> which is the provision in subsection b which worries my noble friend <e> <s> this provision is intended to ensure that the director may so far as it appears to him practicable collect information which is relevant and necessary to enable him to carry out his functions as specified under part i of the bill <e> <s> it is not our intention to give the director powers which are unnecessarily intrusive or draconian nor is it <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble viscount is speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i believe that we should not be over-specific about what the director should or should not include in his annual report <e> <s> the annual report is the directors report on his activities in the year and it should be for him to decide what to include in it subject always to the provisions of clause <e> <s> as has been said on several occasions the office of the director will be a key post <e> <s> the individual with the many rare talents to fulfil it we believe we have found in the person of professor littlechild <e> <s> we should not therefore be over-prescriptive in what he should or should not include in his annual report <e>", "<cs> we have tried to indicate that throughout the bill there is a series of provisions which create checks and balances to cover the activities of the director and others concerned <e> <s> perhaps it is the late hour but i succumb to the persuasion of noble lords opposite and i shall look at the matter again without commitment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords opposite for their succinct introduction of the amendment <e> <s> i can give the noble viscount lord hanworth the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> we believe that apart from these duties to secure for employees in the industry the establishment of health and safety machinery which is relevant to the directors duty the director will otherwise play no part in the conduct of industrial relations to the privatised industry whether it be collective bargaining or any form of negotiating machinery <e> <s> i take the opportunity to make that point and i trust that it is helpful <e>", "<cs> in expressing feelings of sympathy to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for a most unfortunate experience i reassure him that we are grateful to my noble friend lady blatch for bringing forward this amendment which would make it an offence to gain entry in this way <e> <s> we welcome the protection that such a provision will offer householders <e> <s> this is wholly in line with the governments objectives of seeking to ensure the widest possible degree of consumer protection in the bill <e> <s> i recommend that the committee accept it <e>", "<cs> this is an essential and important clause in the bill and obviously we wish to get it right <e> <s> therefore i take note of what the noble lord has said and i shall look into the definition of recklessness <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord or come back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the committee if i intervene at this stage <e> <s> i shall be very happy to speak again at the end of the debate if it is so wished <e> <s> perhaps i should establish as i understand it that the only amendment moved is amendment no <e> <s> h and that we are speaking to the grouping which includes amendments nos <e> <s> za and aa <e>", "<cs> i hope that what i have already said will show clearly that we see it as an advantage <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we all recognise the justice of those remarks <e> <s> i feel that i should explain again my reason for intervening earlier <e> <s> i did so to enable those who have anxieties to realise that the government are willing to do something about these unascertainable costs which are so difficult to anticipate at this stage <e> <s> it is a real concern to some people <e> <s> i am glad that this proposal for action was supported by so many of my noble friends including my noble friends lord erroll lord renton and lord gray of contin all of whom speak from backgrounds of considerable experience in the electricity supply industry <e>", "<cs> i must say at the outset that i believe that the analogy with the industry to which the noble lord lord williams of elvel has drawn our attention is a false analogy <e> <s> i should point out that although the noble lord has referred to certain areas of land in snowdonia and so on the water industry owns very large areas of open land to which <e>", "<cs> i shall try to be as clear and simple as my noble friend lord hood requested <e> <s> the effect of the amendments would be to strike against a fundamental commitment of the governments white paper <e> <s> it would be in total opposition to our proposals for restructuring the industry <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston invited me to comment on our intentions in relation to the special shares and i shall endeavour to oblige <e> <s> i begin by making a couple of general comments about the special shares and the mechanics of their operation <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can cope with the noble lords two questions <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> as regards the public electricity supply companies as i said the special share will go after the first five years and then there will be the per cent <e> <s> requirement for a resolution covering the next five years <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> the city code on takeovers and mergers regulates the acquisition of shares to avoid a person or group of persons acting in concert from obtaining creeping control of a public company <e> <s> it requires that when a person or group acquires more than a fixed percentage of a companys voting shares or rights an offer must be made for the remaining voting shares <e>", "<cs> since these amendments would enable a future government to regain a controlling <e>", "<cs> if a future government wish to change the proposals contained in this bill in whatever form it is eventually passed they can do so by introducing primary legislation <e> <s> i fully recognise the argument of the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> one of the major purposes of this bill is to reduce government influence on the electricity industry <e> <s> therefore we believe it is right that this clause should restrict future government investment in the successor companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the supplying authorities or the appropriate authorities to which the noble lord referred in his original question are the namibian authorities under the overall tutelage of south africa <e> <s> so far as concerns the import of uranium for defence purposes i have assured the noble lord previously that no uranium ore from any source has been delivered to the united kingdom for defence purposes since <e> <s> as to any change of safeguards codings it is not for the receiving country to change the restrictions under which the material is supplied <e> <s> that is a matter for euratom in accordance with the treaty arrangements <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand that to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords bnfl receives uranium from overseas customers for processing and re-export as we have established previously <e> <s> the origin of such material is a matter for its customers and such material is under safeguards while in this country safeguards which cannot be changed by this country <e>", "<cs> my lords n is the euratom coding for no end use restrictions <e> <s> p is the coding that relates to peaceful use only <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that question does not relate directly to the question on the order paper <e> <s> i should therefore have to look into the matter before being able to give the noble lord the facts for which he asks <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the security council resolutions and as a matter of law our view is the same as that of successive british governments <e> <s> the security council cannot take decisions that are generally binding on member states unless there has been a determination of the existence of a threat to peace a breach of the peace or an act of aggression <e> <s> we therefore believe that it is up to us to decide what arrangements we make for trading with namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords the euratom authorities which place the coding on the material that comes to this country are governed by the terms of the euratom treaty <e> <s> we in this country are bound by the terms of the uk-euratom-iaea safeguards agreement and our terms as treaty members <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the terms of both the treaty and the agreement are fully complied with <e> <s> i can only say once again that it is not for the receiving country to change the coding placed upon imports by the euratom authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question twice <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the application from the cegb in respect of sizewell c was made on th june <e> <s> the secretary of state who has a statutory obligation to give a period of at least days in which objections can be made to him has indicated that he will allow a period of three months for objections to be made <e> <s> as the noble lord will no doubt be aware the secretary of state will have a statutory obligation to call for a public inquiry if either of the relevant local planning authorities objects to the sizewell c application <e> <s> even in the event that local planning authorities do not object the secretary of state still has the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is true that the obligation to proceed with the construction of the sizewell c plant will pass to national power after privatisation <e> <s> the matters before the inquiry will depend as always on the objections which are raised <e> <s> until we know what those objections are it is not possible to confirm to the noble lord lord williams exactly what matters would be discussed at a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> obviously that is a major consideration <e> <s> it has to comply with the requirements of section of the electricity act <e> <s> however as i have said the inquiry will also take into account the objections which are made by registered objectors in the period allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is jumping to conclusions <e> <s> certainly there will be a non-fossil fuel obligation which will require the supply companies to use a certain amount of non-fossil fuel <e> <s> that will be substantially nuclear but may be provided from other renewables <e> <s> unfortunately from the governments point of view there is no foregone conclusion that that will embrace the fourth of the projected pwr plants <e> <s> there are many other possibilities for nuclear generation if it is borne in mind that our aim is to cover the gap that would be left by the phasing out of the magnox stations by the beginning of the next century <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> that is part of the statutory obligation imposed on the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by the noble earl <e> <s> nevertheless the application made by the cegb has been accompanied by an environmental statement and the environmental information must therefore form part of the considerations which the secretary of state will take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the rules applying to a public inquiry the answer must be yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there were a number of supplementaries there <e> <s> i believe that the time allowed for objections to be registered for wylfa b and sizewell c is three months <e> <s> but going back in history in the case of sizewell b no time limit was specified for objections because the government had announced in advance that a public inquiry would be held since that was the first of the four planned pwrs <e> <s> as for hinkley c the time allowed to register objections was four months <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly very concerned about the environmental consequences of fossil fuel burning <e> <s> nevertheless we are no less concerned about the need to ensure security of supply <e> <s> the government believe that new nuclear capacity is necessary to replace the magnox stations that will be phased out by the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly note that recommendation and draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i understand it the relevant planning regulations come under the town and country planning act with respect to deemed planning consent <e> <s> as i have said the environmental factors are now required as a result of the european community directive on environmental impact <e> <s> the environmental statement has already been made has accompanied the application and will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the noble lord asked a variety of supplementaries on the previous occasion <e> <s> it is too soon to say <e> <s> the hinkley c inquiry is certainly not completed <e> <s> i think that it is unlikely that the report will be received within the three-month period although there is always likely to be a time lag between the end of the three-month period and the start of the new inquiry for processing objections <e> <s> i can give the noble lord no assurance that there will be no public inquiry before the hinkley c report has been received <e>", "<cs> i am unable to accept this amendment but perhaps it would assist the committee if i set out briefly what clause is trying to do <e> <s> its purpose is to facilitate the use of a composite prospectus as we all understand it for the flotation of two or more successor companies <e>", "<cs> i cherished the fond hope that i might have satisfied the noble lord lord williams at this stage of our proceedings but all i can say is that i am not surprised that yet again i did not succeed <e>", "<cs> yes i was coming to that <e> <s> the scottish boards and the generating companies will be subject to the requirements of the financial services act <e> <s> it is only the supply companies that will be subject to a simultaneous sale <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that the supply companies prospectus will also contain particulars on the grid company <e> <s> where the information relates to the grid the directors of that company will be responsible for the information <e> <s> the responsibility will be clearly defined in the prospectus itself as i have said <e> <s> we shall be complying with the provisions of section of the financial services act <e> <s> there will be verification which will involve the government and their advisers <e> <s> therefore there is no need to mention that in the bill <e> <s> i believe that the noble lords anxieties are fully covered <e>", "<cs> the clause as drafted relates to two or more successor companies <e> <s> when the amendment was tabled i believe its relevance concerned the simultaneous flotation of the area board companies <e> <s> i now realise that the noble lord lord williams intended his amendment to go somewhat wider than that <e> <s> i believe that the provisions with which we are complying entirely fulfil our responsibility in giving the public all the information that it requires and full knowledge of those responsible <e>", "<cs> i believe that the clause is drafted to facilitate any simultaneous sale but that does not mean that all the sales will be simultaneous <e> <s> a decision has not yet been taken as to whether the two scottish electricity companies should have a composite prospectus or separate prospectuses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made it perfectly clear what he would like the secretary of state to do <e> <s> returning to the scottish question both scottish electricity companies will be responsible for the particulars as regards the nuclear subsidiary <e> <s> the sale of the shares of a company which owns shares in other companies is not a sale of the shares in those other companies <e> <s> at least that is my understanding <e> <s> in view of the concern expressed i undertake to take this matter back for it to be looked at again <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> i must say that the government cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> however we have had a most useful debate on the subject <e> <s> perhaps i may preface my remarks by providing the noble lord lord peston with some information <e> <s> i understand that flotation spelt floatation follows the <e>", "<cs> with leave i do not believe that that was the purport of my remarks <e> <s> i emphasised that the taxpayer was important <e> <s> we believe that a good price should be received from the sale <e> <s> the effect of the amendment which would push the costs entirely on to the successor companies would have a greater consequence on the consumer than the way in which we propose the arrangements should proceed <e>", "<cs> i am unable to accept this amendment <e> <s> therefore i was pleased to hear that the noble lord regards it as a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> in this case a clean sheet refers to the sorting out of the foreign loan position <e> <s> i expand upon what i said <e> <s> public sector industries have been able to borrow from foreign currency lenders such as the european investment bank on behalf of the official reserves <e> <s> this borrowing has enjoyed an interest rate benefit and the treasury has provided cover against exchange risks <e> <s> the costs to the taxpayer would be incurred if the loans were transferred to the successor companies by effectively subsidising the rates of interest on the loans <e> <s> treasury-assisted interest rates are appropriate to public sector bodies but we believe not to private sector bodies <e>", "<cs> i shall investigate the position in an endeavour to point the noble lord in the right direction but i feel that it is important to say that we are at least months or more away from the first sale <e> <s> indeed the legislation has not yet been completed and so the details i have given to the committee on which i have tried to be helpful or as helpful as i can are as specific and clear as can reasonably be expected so far in advance of the first sale which as i said is months way <e>", "<cs> we have already discussed how the industry in england and wales is taxed for corporation tax purposes as a single entity <e> <s> of course that has meant that although in the past the cegb has incurred tax losses they have been set against profits made by the area boards <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord appreciates that <e> <s> therefore the consequence has been that the area boards have paid less tax to date than they would have done had they been taxed separately <e> <s> for the same reasons the cegb has not to date enjoyed the full benefit of those tax losses itself <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the noble lords intention is to obtain information and i shall endeavour to give as much apposite information as possible <e> <s> perhaps i should start by saying that the aim behind schedule is to preserve continuity <e> <s> therefore the opening paragraphs to paragraph provide among other things for that continuity in regard to taxation of the trading profits of the industry <e> <s> they do so by specifying that each successor company should be deemed at all times to have been carrying on as a separate trade the trade or part of a trade which it inherits from its predecessor <e> <s> in this respect the noble lords amendment would be perfectly acceptable as regards the successor companies of the area boards because they will inherit a specific entity trade whereas the cegb is being transferred in three parts and it is in that respect that the expression parts of trades is required <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely clear why the noble lord is having so much difficulty with this amendment <e> <s> regarding the cegb and the two generating companies it seems that there is a case where part of a trade is being passed on <e> <s> nevertheless i am assured that it is not a question of splitting up individual trades such as transmission <e> <s> what we are doing is simply splitting up the cegbs aggregate trading position <e> <s> i hope that helps <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made himself perfectly clear on this matter <e> <s> i recognise that his objection is to or parts of trades <e> <s> i shall look into the problem again and refer to it later should further clarification be necessary <e>", "<cs> all the provisions in the schedule are the outcome and product of full consultation with the inland revenue <e> <s> it agreed to this provision and to the schedule as a whole <e> <s> i am not sure whether that reassures the noble lord <e>", "<cs> sub-paragraph of paragraph enables tax losses and capital expenditure to be apportioned among the successor companies in accordance with the terms of a transferors transfer scheme <e> <s> the legislation actually uses the term unallowed tax losses <e> <s> that expression is defined in sub-paragraph <e> <s> that term encompasses in laymens terms losses and other tax reliefs which are allowable for tax purposes but have not yet taking the present actually been allowed <e> <s> in other words they have not yet been absorbed by taxable profits <e> <s> it is because such amounts have not been allowed to any person that they are to be apportioned among the relevant successor companies <e> <s> in turn this is a further strand in ensuring that continuity can be brought to the tax affairs of the industry <e> <s> it may be that the amendment is based on the assumption that an unallowed tax loss is one which would not ordinarily be allowable to any person <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the spirit in which he has moved this amendment and those preceding it <e> <s> paragraph of the schedule applies in a situation where any assets or liabilities of an existing body in england and wales which are transferred by the bill to a successor company become vested in that body by virtue of a transfer from another existing body or two more successive transfers between existing bodies <e> <s> in other words it applies where assets and liabilities became vested for tax purposes in the electricity council some time before they were acquired by the body by which they were transferred on the transfer date <e> <s> this provision therefore has the effect that the particular assets and liabilities will be treated as having been assets and liabilities of the relevant successor company since <e>", "<cs> i think that in the circumstances i should say that i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the issue <e> <s> i shall of course look into the matter to ensure that we are confident that our drafting covers the point referred to <e>", "<cs> sub-paragraph of paragraph of the schedule gives effect to the taxation rules in that paragraph in relation to accounting periods beginning after the final accounting period <e> <s> the term the final accounting period as used in paragraph is defined as the last accounting period of the electricity council or in the case of an existing body in scotland of that body ending before the transfer date <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to extend the definition to <e>", "<cs> i must reiterate that any adjustments to the substance of the accounts for the electricity boards will be taken into consideration in the opening accounts of the successor companies <e> <s> these will show those portions of the closing accounts inherited by the appropriate successor and indicate any material changes that have taken place <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble lord is referring to section not section <e>", "<cs> i would have been in something of a dilemma had it been otherwise <e> <s> section has the effect that any trade carried on by an area board or the generating board is treated for the purposes of the corporation tax acts as part of a trade carried on by the electricity council that any property rights or liabilities of such a board is treated for those purposes as property rights or liabilities of the electricity council and that anything done by or to such a board is deemed for those purposes to have been done by or to the electricity council <e>", "<cs> again i must ask the committee to bear with a rather technical explanation <e>", "<cs> again i welcome the spirit in which the amendment is moved <e> <s> perhaps it would help if i said a few words about the background to this clause <e>", "<cs> yes it is my understanding that the method of how the redistribution will be made is the subject of agreement <e> <s> i accept the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> i accept that the sight of electricity lines above the ground can be unattractive <e> <s> indeed a great deal is already being done to go underground where practicable and possible <e> <s> i have seen some excellent examples provided by the yorkshire board in this respect <e>", "<cs> last week we debated the governments proposals for ensuring the future of nuclear power in the private sector <e> <s> as has been said on a division on the amendment tabled by the noble earl lord halsbury and others we succeeded in having your lordships confirm support for our proposals <e> <s> clause and schedule provide the final plank in the proposals but i am happy to respond to the general remarks of the noble lord lord peston because this is a very important topic <e>", "<cs> the noble lord speaks from a considerable knowledge of this subject <e> <s> nevertheless the reference which i made to berkeley shows that adequate provision has been made in advance according to the statement made by the noble lord lord marshall of goring <e>", "<cs> yes that is my understanding <e> <s> i shall now move on to respond to the question which i believe the noble lord lord peston asked me as regards whether double counting would apply if grants are provided <e> <s> the answer is no <e> <s> the government will make their policy on the use of grants clear in the prospectus when national power is sold <e> <s> the shares will be priced against the background of this policy there will therefore be no double counting <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for clarifying what he meant <e> <s> i responded by quoting a leading figure from the industry <e> <s> as i said in relation to the pwr applications i believe the fact that the industry is pursuing that policy shows confidence and enthusiasm for the future <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friends for their suggestions and to the noble lord lord peston for having accepted the point that changes or tightening of the regulatory regime come within the scope of government support <e> <s> given the timescales involved which we have already discussed we believe that there may be other situations where it may be equally appropriate for the government to be able to make a contribution if costs rise even though the cost rises may not have been the direct result of the regulatory change itself <e>", "<cs> i made reference in relation to the general remarks that the noble lord lord peston chose to make in introducing his first amendment this afternoon to the interesting debate <e>", "<cs> i need say no more than i believe that our proposals are designed to achieve and certainly aimed specifically at obtaining full value for the industry <e>", "<cs> clause is intended to clarify the effect of general competition law on the electricity industry after privatisation <e> <s> i am sorry that it has not sufficiently clarified it for the benefit of the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> for the first time it means that the restrictive trade practices act will bear on the industry <e> <s> there is nothing mysterious about the power in subsection b which the amendment seeks to delete to make exemptions from that act <e> <s> there are already procedures for such an exemption-making power for example in the gas act and in the restrictive trade practices act itself <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to help the committee by giving examples <e> <s> they include certain agreements which are essential to the future operation of the industry and which are currently in the process of development <e> <s> for example there is the technical grid operating code which will enable the transmission system to be run efficiently <e> <s> the distributors and generators pooling agreements will enable the economic benefits of the merit order and energy trading to be realised <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston will remember we agreed that this was a complex area <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising these questions because we believe that clause is an example of our intention that the bill should improve the position of consumers <e> <s> i first pick up his point about gas being included in an electricity bill <e> <s> the act is the rights of entry gas and electricity boards act so it is inevitable that we must deal with both <e> <s> however we believe that it is important to keep the procedures consistent as between the two industries <e> <s> the act which is being amended treated the two industries equally and we believe that we should follow that through <e>", "<cs> i should point out that the right is granted only to public electricity suppliers and that the requirements of the act that appropriate notice be given and that the consent of the owner or occupier be obtained are important <e> <s> after all when a warrant is sought the act requires that the supplier gives to the magistrate sworn information in writing to show the purpose for which entry is required that there is a right of entry for that purpose and that the relevant requirements which attach to the power such as giving notice have been complied with <e> <s> therefore it is a fairly thorough procedure <e>", "<cs> as i said public electricity suppliers have this right but they are the only ones to have the statutory right of entry <e> <s> i believe that the procedures to which i have referred about notice and the information to be given are adequate to cover the problem about which the noble lord seems anxious <e> <s> i do not quite follow his argument in relation to the example that he gave <e>", "<cs> the government do not intend to do anything about the new clause and the amendments to clause in your lordships house <e> <s> it is not for me to comment on what may happen in another place <e> <s> i point out as i did when i argued against the amendments at an earlier stage that we see a danger in this new clause with the associated amendments to clause in that they risk undermining the existing safety regime which we believe to be extremely good <e> <s> by providing in the bill for a procedure different from that in other safety legislation we believe that the risks are exacerbated <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming on to deal with some of these points more specifically but perhaps i can take the opportunity to say that new entrants into the market will require licences <e> <s> but the noble lord has not satisfactorily explained how the licence conditions which may operate against each individual licence holder should be made general in a way that will fix prices among all licence holders <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the example quoted by the noble lord entirely justifies the governments opposition to these amendments <e> <s> that is precisely the kind of deal that we wish to allow the area boards to carry out <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that there is no possibility of a public electricity supplier being permitted to charge differently simply on the basis of geographical location <e> <s> the noble lords worst fears are certainly not justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the characteristic sense of humour of the noble lord lord williams has not deserted him <e> <s> in winding up the debate my noble friend lord stanley recognised that we were voting on the principle of the amendment <e> <s> he also recognised that the amendment might be defective <e> <s> the government will of course be considering their position <e> <s> however i feel sure that in the meantime we should press on with the many important amendments before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have contributed to the discussion <e> <s> i note that the noble lord lord peston effectively regarded this as a probing amendment <e> <s> therefore i shall respond by saying that the office of electricity regulation will be a non-ministerial government department <e> <s> it is entirely customary for all civil service manpower issues to be cleared with the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i should say that he system of funding is that offer will be financed by vote <e> <s> its costs will be clearly identified and as with all the costs of regulation they will be recovered through the licence fees <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am not going to ask the house to oppose the amendment <e> <s> however in saying that i should make it clear that that does not tie the hands of the government in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams of elvel has explained the reasons behind his amendment and these have been echoed by contributions from others of your lordships <e> <s> as i have frequently said before the government have every sympathy with the principle of being environmentally friendly in what we do <e> <s> we believe that the electricity supply industry like other industrial undertakings should show proper concern for the environmental consequences in what they do <e> <s> on previous occasions i have quoted the acts of parliament and european community directives which already apply to and regulate the electricity supply industry in environmental matters and particularly in relation to pollution control which i think we all agree is the main area where the electricity industry impinges upon the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords the structure of clause with some duties being made subject to others is well precedented <e> <s> the three primary duties in subsection are all about protecting the interests of customers <e> <s> there is an inherent logic in the fact that the subsequent provisions of the clause in effect cascade down <e> <s> i can assure the house of the strength of the governments commitment to the protection of consumers interests the promotion of the efficient use of electricity and the protection of public safety and the health and safety of those working in the industry <e> <s> perhaps i may quote an example of how we see the provisions working <e> <s> licence holders will be required to comply with regulations made under clause relating to safety <e> <s> they will not be able to plead that the competition requirements in their licences excuse them from this obligation <e> <s> although in the terminology of the clause subsection is subject to subsections and clearly they have to be taken together and are complementary <e>", "<cs> my lords the clause duty which is to protect the public from dangers arising from the generation transmission and supply of electricity will apply to economic regulation as well as to all the other functions of the secretary of state and the director under part i of the bill <e> <s> it will ensure that the director and the secretary of state will bear in mind the needs of public safety at all times and therefore there will not be a conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is no single answer to this point <e> <s> in any one situation a balance has to be struck between the general duties and the subsidiary duties <e> <s> consumers will in fact benefit from increased competition which will exert a downward pressure on costs which will be passed on to the final consumer through the price control mechanism in the licensing regime <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the two precedents on which this particular provision is founded are section of the gas act and section of the telecommunications act <e> <s> however having said that i must re-emphasise that we believe as we have said many times indeed it was a basic premise of the white paper that competition is the best protection of consumers interests <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps first of all i may deal with amendment no <e> <s> and in doing so respond to some of the questions raised in the course of the debate <e> <s> i wish to say how delighted i am that so many of your lordships have felt able to give a welcome to this effort on the governments part to meet the concerns expressed at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i had made it clear that the duties of the secretary of state in this matter are longstop duties in the national interest <e> <s> i hoped also that i had made it clear that intellectual property rights are essentially private matters and therefore do not come into that category <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> however i should say that they are internal matters and in that sense private matters <e> <s> however if i may consider this particular matter again i shall write to the noble lord and perhaps clarify anything that seems to be outstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord lord ezra that heat and steam co-generated with electricity is an important potential source of energy which should be utilised as far as possible <e> <s> i should point out that this government have done more than any other to promote energy efficiency in all its forms <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord hanworth has reminded us the department of energy has funded an extensive programme in the field of combined heat and power to seek to establish the potential for chp both on a city-wide and a local basis <e> <s> as we have been reminded too we are in bringing forward amendments nos <e> <s> and to clause of the bill specifically drawing attention to combined heat and power <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that to some extent i have already responded to those concerns <e> <s> at the outset of my remarks on this amendment i said that we believed this government have done more for energy efficiency than any other <e> <s> we have broken new ground in the bill on energy efficiency in imposing duties on the secretary of state and the director to take energy efficiency into account <e> <s> we therefore expect energy efficiency to take its rightful place in all the considerations that have to concern us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give the house the assurance that the government certainly believe that renewables have a significant contribution to make to diversity in generation <e> <s> moreover that will be increasingly true in the future as many of the developing renewable technologies <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> to contribute to the obligation it will have to be positively identified as from a non-fossil or renewable source within the non-fossil obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the amendment challenges the governments policy of maintaining security of supply and is therefore unacceptable for reasons which i hope to be able to demonstrate <e>", "<cs> my lords i was somewhat puzzled by the amendment <e> <s> i thought that it might refer to rating in the sense that the noble lord lord shepherd has explained but it could equally have applied to capacity rating which we discussed earlier on the basis of intermittent sources <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall write to the noble lord to clarify the position <e> <s> it is my <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly accept that tidal power has the potential to <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the contribution of the noble lord lord howie of troon has answered adequately the points raised by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> at question time recently i answered very carefully similar questions that he raises now <e> <s> the secretary of state is required to allow a minimum of days in which objections to a power station application can be made to him <e> <s> however in the cases of wylfa b and sizewell c to which the noble lord referred the secretary of state is allowed three months for any objections to be made for registration <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall look with interest at all the contributions to the debate <e> <s> however i believe that the point raised by the noble lord is not relevant to the amendment now before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that there was no change but i said that there was no change of substance <e> <s> i cannot add anything to the explanation given by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the welcome which has generally been given to the government amendments <e> <s> i have noted the criticisms that have also been advanced and am happy to note that they are very few <e> <s> many of them have been answered in previous debates and so i shall not respond specifically <e> <s> however it is my understanding that archaeology includes industrial archaeology and that historic covers engineering history <e> <s> as i said earlier i believe that the situation is covered <e> <s> nevertheless it would be churlish of me to refuse the lifeline thrown out by the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> in view of the wide scope of the amendments which we have already conceded i shall consider whether there is any way in which we can take his arguments into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to move amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord glenarthur made clear in committee we have given considerable thought to whether a new national body is needed in the privatised industry <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware the select committee on energy of another place recommended to the government that there was no need for such a body <e> <s> the government accepted that view in their formal response to the committees report <e> <s> we felt that consumer interests would best be served by local consumer committees serving grass roots needs <e>", "<cs> my lords it would indeed be shocking if we did not try to humour the noble lord lord peston after his appeal <e> <s> the present wording of the bill requires the consumers committees to report to the director from time to time <e> <s> we believe that it is important that the committees should be able to report to the director freely at any time as it is likely that they will make several reports in every year either on their activities or at the request of the director or on a matter which they may wish to draw to the directors attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and although my noble friend lord peyton referred to his amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i must say that i was somewhat baffled as to the justification for the grouping so i listened with interest to the noble lord <e> <s> lord williams because it seems to me that on the one hand clause to which amendment no <e> <s> applies deals with the transfer of assets of the area boards to the successor companies and on the other hand clause to which amendment no <e> <s> applies deals with the proposed structure of the electricity supply industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to deal further with the points raised by my noble friend concerning directors and i hope he will be a little patient if i endeavour to cover all the points raised in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that difficult to accept <e> <s> for example i have said that the grid code is currently in circulation and being commented on by potential users <e> <s> it will depend on the completion of that process as to the time at which we can issue it <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that just as these matters are complex we also believe that they require adequate and thorough consultation <e> <s> that has to take place before draft documents are produced for wider circulation <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will accept that <e> <s> it is a very valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with your lordships <e> <s> this is a very complex matter <e> <s> it is difficult for the average citizen to grasp and it is clearly difficult even for those noble lords who are experts <e> <s> a great deal of work has and continues to be done by the experts who will continue to operate the system after privatisation <e> <s> they are confident that they can meet the challenges and complexities to which your lordships have drawn attention <e> <s> i believe that they will be successful <e> <s> if my noble friends wish me to continue to respond to the points that they have raised i shall be happy to do so if i am permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to explain how there is a delicate balance <e> <s> in the very complex situation that we have before us we have endeavoured to provide for arrangements which will preserve the necessary balance between equity and detailed control <e> <s> i believe that the arrangements which have been put forward and which we have been discussing further details will be produced as soon as possible will adequately meet the needs of the industry and the concerns that have been expressed today <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord williams said in presenting this amendment we have already had a discussion in committee about substantially the same matter <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble baroness lady white i say as i said then that i believe that the amendment is based on a false analogy with the water industry which owns very large areas of attractive land to which the public have access <e> <s> in contrast the land held by the electricity industry is primarily industrial <e> <s> i did undertake however to consider the first part of the amendment further and indeed i did so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for saying that he found the letter helpful <e> <s> i must apologise for the fact that the letter was received by him only this morning <e> <s> i shall of course ensure that the noble lord lord lloyd receives a copy of the letter <e> <s> perhaps therefore i do not need to deal with the points made in it except very briefly to say that we reaffirmed that the term generally accepted accounting principles is generally taken to refer to statements of standard accounting practice issued from time to time by the six main uk and irish accountancy bodies together with the uk law and established accepted precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that there is no conflict between the aims of the noble lord lord williams and ourselves <e> <s> perhaps i should say a brief word about the purpose of clause as there may have been some misunderstanding <e> <s> this is essentially a transitional provision which will apply only this year <e> <s> its purpose therefore is to ensure continuity of accounts between the successor companies and their predecessors <e> <s> clause will cease to have practical effect after the successors have prepared and published their first accounts after vesting <e> <s> i say this because it may be felt that the clause has a more general application beyond that transitional period <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if my response does not satisfy the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> however i feel that i have to refer him to his noble friend lord williams who is responsible for the drafting <e> <s> i was under the impression that the amendment is consequential on one that was previously agreed <e> <s> in fact i was proposing not to speak against it on that basis <e> <s> by not speaking against it i did not feel that the governments hands would be tied in another place or elsewhere in relation to it <e> <s> perhaps i may leave it like that and refer the noble lord to his noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood him correctly the noble lord lord peston asked whether it was intended to pre-pay those obligations now <e> <s> i must point out to him that in the light of our discussions at a previous stage because the sums involved are uncertain unforeseeable and unascertainable whichever word one chooses to use we have felt it necessary to introduce the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that a future secretary of state would be bound as i have said <e> <s> it is of course always open to parliament through its procedures to raise questions initiate debates to take some action to question and to open up the matter <e> <s> if the government are under a legal obligation to pay in that respect as much as in their purchases of say stationery they will have to find the means <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is well aware the statutory minimum period for objections to be made to the secretary of state is days <e> <s> we therefore believe that three months is a very ample period of time <e> <s> given the publicity that attaches to these applications there is no question of anybody not hearing about the application until the last minute <e> <s> it is for the local planning authorities to make their own arrangements in this respect <e> <s> it is not for the government to interfere in those arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said previously in relation to this question the non-fossil fuel obligation will of course be a consideration <e> <s> however the planning arrangements and procedures are not in any other way affected by it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government are concerned about the objections which are raised <e> <s> that is why a period of three months has been given to enable local people to make their objections <e> <s> it seems to me that what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is now seeking is two tranches to the procedure <e> <s> he seems to want an initial period in which people can dispute the length of time for registering objections and then a further period for actually registering the objections <e> <s> in my view the registration of objection can happen right away <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government will consider any objections that are raised <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord hatch will help the local communities by explaining to them that instead of objecting to the period for objections they should get on and make their objections <e>", "<cs> my lords i am by no means trying to smear the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra well knows that i am a great supporter of chp <e> <s> all that i have said so far goes to prove that we have made every effort to meet the arguments that have been raised <e> <s> i am now going on to show how the government support the various schemes and the concept of combined heat and power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry for the reference it clearly has no application at all to the amendment it was used only as an analogy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the escape lines as it were offered by my noble friend and the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> nevertheless i do not think that they are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the desire of the noble lord lord williams to clarify the position <e> <s> however i explained the purpose of clause b when we discussed this topic during committee stage <e> <s> i explained then that the united kingdom has treaty obligations which prevent us from discriminating in any way against supplies from other european community countries <e> <s> we do not intend indeed we are unable to do otherwise <e> <s> our approach will be to treat imports on a basis which is no less favourable and no more favourable than the basis on which supplies from within the united kingdom are assessed <e> <s> subsection a was included in the bill to make sure that this is the case even where there may be significant differences between the non-fossil contracts within the united kingdom and those for imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to find any such additional information and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord peston and lord ezra for their comments and the points that they have raised <e> <s> as regards the welcome given by the noble lord lord peston to the safeguarding of employees rights and conditions i point out that it is not unusual for the government to consult widely and to include the trade unions <e> <s> considerable discussions about pension rights were held with the trade unions in respect of the electricity bill as the noble lord will remember <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the full extent of the figures emerged only over the past couple of months <e> <s> the scrutiny of the accounts of nationalised industries as the noble baroness will know is in the first place a matter for the auditors concerned <e> <s> from time to time the department meets the industry and its auditors on the accounts <e> <s> clearly this happens on an ongoing basis in normal circumstances <e> <s> however in the preparation for privatisation all parties have been looking very keenly at the accounts to ensure that they properly reflect all the costs <e> <s> it is as a result of that examination that the figures have emerged <e> <s> there has been no attempt to deceive anyone certainly not this house <e> <s> we are laying our proposals and the facts before the house at the earliest possible time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his contribution which is as always well founded on his knowledge of the industry <e> <s> however on the facts that the government have been considering in reaching this decision the problem area is very much the magnox stations which we feel should be kept under sector control <e> <s> the information coming forward about the progress of the agrs shows that some of the problems that have emerged in the past have been overcome and that all the agrs not only those referred to by the noble earl have a long and successful future ahead of them <e>", "<cs> my lords provision that had been thought adequate as regards future liabilities on de-commissioning re-processing and so on stood both on a historic cost and on a current cost basis at billion in the accounts <e> <s> the provision in the accounts is likely to be at least double that figure <e> <s> the majority of these costs are for nuclear provision which will be inherited by national power <e> <s> it is simply a matter of fact that the full extent of these future costs has only been definitively worked out in the recent past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the importance and significance of the statement <e> <s> i repeat that the process of privatisation has focused attention on the true cost of nuclear power and of the governments determination to make the cost transparent <e> <s> that has resulted in new figures being brought to light <e> <s> the industry the government and their advisers have undertaken a thorough analysis of the make-up of the provision as part of the preparation for privatisation <e> <s> some costs had not been previously identified and others were accounted for differently <e> <s> there are a variety of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i shall certainly communicate with the usual channels <e> <s> i am sure that we shall be able to inform your lordships at the earliest possible opportunity what the procedure will be <e> <s> i indicated that there are other orders and regulations due to be made under the bill which would give an opportunity to debate if not the specific increase of funds then the wider issues which have been presented in this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the provision that i quoted earlier and which exists in the cegbs accounts standing at billion in the accounts was the result of charges made to the consumer <e> <s> in that sense the consumer paid <e> <s> apart from the magnox stations which are to be dealt with separately by the government future costs will also be accounted for in the charges to the consumer <e> <s> i believe that most investors would treat such provision as equivalent to debt in many respects <e>", "<cs> my lords we still believe that the bill is a good one and will achieve our objectives <e> <s> our proposals are consistent with the bill as presently drafted <e> <s> indeed the proposals which are the subject of this statement will contribute to the success of the privatisation <e> <s> a good deal of extra work will be needed but we are confident that privatisation of the electricity industry can be completed as intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind personal remarks and for his remarks about my noble friend lord trafford <e> <s> nobody could regret more deeply than i that it is not he who is standing at this dispatch box today <e> <s> i am sure that we are all greatly saddened both by the loss in personal terms and in terms of the very valuable contribution that he always made to the business of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for his kind remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords we have held and continue to hold wide-ranging discussions with a large cross-section of nhs staff professional bodies and other interested parties about implementing our proposals <e> <s> we remain firmly committed to a participative approach to implementation <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness may be reassured that consultation and discussion will continue with the bodies to which she referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments proposals are aimed at altering any difficulties that we experience over the national health service <e> <s> i emphasise that health service chairmen and managers upon whom the reforms depend are strong supporters of the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the governments aim is clear in these proposals <e> <s> it is to bring health care everywhere up to the standard of the best <e>", "<cs> my lords yes this is indeed an important development of hospice care <e> <s> i understand that some hospices provide home and day care and bereavement services <e> <s> some act as centres for the training of volunteers and professionals <e> <s> most can certainly draw on volunteer helpers <e> <s> within the national health service provision there are more than home care teams working alongside front line staff <e> <s> some of the concerns in this area may be met by the announcement made yesterday by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security which confirmed that we intend to abolish the six months qualifying period for attendance allowance for terminally ill people <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that funding through local health authorities varies throughout the country <e> <s> in some cases it is very little and in other cases it is considerably more than per cent <e> <s> nevertheless the government accept in principle the desirability of achieving a more balanced stable and equitable pattern of financial support for independent hospices <e> <s> however the detailed application of the principle is complicated and that is why we are still working on it <e> <s> i shall of course look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend may be sure that we shall try to achieve the best possible results <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to my noble friend must be no <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing in the new contract that will make the problem of major city and london costs in particular any worse <e> <s> the contract will enable legitimate mixing of private and national health service care <e> <s> but we shall of course monitor the effect of the proposals and see how they work in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the present pay system was introduced in when the main need was to encourage dentists to carry out as many fillings and other treatments as they could <e> <s> nowadays there is general agreement that we need a more preventive approach a more even coverage of the population and to improve the service to the patient <e> <s> hence the proposed new contract <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of dentists earnings will be for all-round care including preventive work rather than individual pieces of work <e> <s> dentists have long argued <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason why it should <e>", "<cs> my lords the new contract will not reduce the scope for private practice <e> <s> indeed it includes proposals to liberalise the rules which limit the circumstances in which private treatment may be mixed with national health service treatment <e> <s> if patients wish to receive private treatment from a dentist who previously cared for them under the national health service they will as now be free to do so <e> <s> the contract will ensure however that patients understand the options open to them and that if they are accepted as national health service patients they will have access to the full range of nhs treatment if they need it <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will welcome this removal of any possible confusion to patients on their entitlements under the national health service <e> <s> i must emphasise that in these proposals it is the interests of patients which come first <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said previously the profession welcomed the opportunity to negotiate a new contract which it felt was long overdue <e> <s> the new contract offers benefits for dentists which they welcome in particular greater clinical freedom and a stable flow of income <e> <s> the contract is unlikely to have the effect of driving dentists away from the national health service <e> <s> there is a strong feeling among many members of the profession that demand will increase and that people will be attracted as a result of the new proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the department commissioned a research project in known as the dowie project <e> <s> the field work was carried out in <e> <s> we pre-empted the results of that with our june initiative and indeed the other pilot studies initiative which has been launched <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the career possibilities for junior doctors are very relevant to recruitment <e> <s> of course as the noble lord knows health authorities are responsible for determining the number of consultants required to meet service needs <e> <s> their strategic plans indicate an annual increase in consultants numbers averaging per cent <e> <s> per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the interest in this matter particularly in your lordships house <e> <s> indeed i reiterate that the initiatives already introduced by the government fully meet the concerns which have been expressed that is the june initiative and the pilot studies initiative <e> <s> however i feel sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will take all considerations into account in reaching his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> however from the evidence of the initiatives we know that substantial progress has been made in reducing onerous rotas <e> <s> we now need to consider how best to further reduce the remaining onerous rotas <e> <s> i believe that that is where the pilot studies will be of particular assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> i believe that in responding to the question about the potential career possibilities for junior doctors the end number of posts available is very relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords from the noble lords question i am not sure whether he is talking about the improvement of quality or numbers of junior doctors <e> <s> i understand that the numbers are not increasing and i very much hope that the quality is improving <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as i tried to say the history of this matter goes back to to a short report by the select committee in another place <e> <s> it was as a result of insufficient progress in that area that the department of health commissioned research in and is taking the additional initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it has levelled off <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that the noble lord has taken me somewhat by surprise <e> <s> perhaps i may come back to him on that point or is an answer a prerequisite for starting our discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking noble lords on all sides of the house for their contributions many of which have been made with the benefit of practical experience <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord ennals that the preliminary point he raised with me as regards errors in drafting took me by surprise <e> <s> i certainly have not received notice of his question and i am not aware of any such errors <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept some responsibility for sentencing policies after all they have to finance the prison and probation services which are responsible for implementing many of the courts decisions <e> <s> we can influence the public debate on sentencing through publications like the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is the case because there is no obligation on people to use the scheme if they do not wish to incur debt and have other ways of financing themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for the trustees of the macfarlane trust to allocate funds in the way that they consider best meets the needs of those eligible for help <e> <s> there should therefore be no need for or question of an indemnity from the government in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the position under successive governments has been that there is no system of no fault compensation for medical accidents <e> <s> the pearson commission considered the arguments but did not recommend such a system <e> <s> the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is endeavouring to make me admit fault on behalf of the government <e> <s> since this matter is currently before the courts it is not appropriate for me to comment further <e>", "<cs> my lords in the announcement made last week the government committed themselves to making a further million available <e> <s> this is in addition to the million previously made available which has certainly not all been spent by the macfarlane trust <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is as soon as possible

which relate to sight tests <e>", "<cs> the amount charged for a private sight test is a matter between the patient and the optician <e> <s> it is up to individual opticians to use their commercial judgment and set their prices accordingly <e> <s> as private sight tests fall outside the remit of the general ophthalmic services we do not collect information on the level of charges currently being set <e>", "<cs> the cost to the optician of a pair of uncut ophthalmic spherical lenses of power up to plus dioptres manufactured within the uk to british standards is between and depending upon the power of the lenses and the size of the uncut lens required <e> <s> to this must be added the cost of glazing which is between and depending upon the glazing requirements of the spectacle frame <e> <s> this does not include the price of the spectacle frame or any dispensing fees <e> <s> cheaper lenses are available from less developed countries and other sources but these are not always manufactured to a recognised british or international standard <e> <s> we would not wish to interfere in the sale of spectacles which is a private transaction <e>", "<cs> regulations specify that when undertaking a sight test an optician should carry out an eye examination to look for signs of injury disease or abnormality and apply other tests appropriate to the patient <e> <s> this is in addition to determining the optical prescription through refraction <e> <s> the terms sight and defects of sight although not specifically defined in the act are well understood by those using them and convey the full meaning of sight testing and the obligations of opticians <e> <s> the terms refraction defects of refraction and refractionist only convey part of their obligation and are therefore considered inappropriate <e>", "<cs> the judgment given by the european court is confined exclusively to the interpretation of article ac of the sixth vat directive and does not range wider than the vat field <e> <s> we therefore do not intend to introduce legislation to amend the opticians act <e>", "<cs> we have no current plans to amend the terms of the opticians act to alter the constitution or duties of the general optical council <e>", "<cs> none <e> <s> the writing of a prescription from the results of a sight test is a matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the example quoted by my noble friend gives us hope that the price of ready-made spectacles is indeed coming down as an average <e> <s> however i am informed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that presbyopia is recognised as a common condition affecting the eyes from middle age onwards <e> <s> regulations were introduced in april this year as a consequence of an amendment to the health and medicines act which allowed the sale of reading glasses to adults without the need for an optical prescription <e> <s> i believe that the example quoted by my noble friend lord orr-ewing suggests that sales of ready-made spectacles are increasing and therefore bringing down the average price <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the noble lord that the reason i am answering the question is that it is on the order paper <e> <s> i said at the outset that the government consider that the sale of reading glasses is a private transaction and that an element of competition having been introduced we must allow market forces to operate <e> <s> that is precisely what we are doing <e>", "<cs> it may well be so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there are methods of eye testing which do not go so far as our requirements for eye examinations but which can be done by machines <e> <s> at the moment the government have no plans to regard those as covering the situation completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated that the government are hoping that the competition that is now possible will enable people to shop around and choose the spectacles they want from the wide variety of prices available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the general optical council has undertaken to carry out a review of optical services in the light of the secretary of states decision not to proceed with the two-tier sight test <e> <s> it is still unclear what this review will encompass but we believe that it will cover educating the public on the benefits of eye care the financial benefits to the customer of eye care the effects of recent legislative changes on the national health service the legal effects of these changes and preparing the profession for europe in <e> <s> i understand that the general optical council intends to report to the secretary of state by next summer and therefore i feel that this review will serve a useful purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords assessment takes place in a number of areas where the description of poachers against poachers could be used including within the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the dti in the context of the question put to me as a representative of the department of health <e> <s> anyone may write to sir gordon borrie and ask him to consider undertaking an investigation of the market activities of a company or group of companies and as the noble lord said the director general himself can initiate action <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that the different requirements for peoples eyes mean that they will need to be satisfied in different ways <e> <s> in the present situation there is a wide variety of choice available and it is up to the consumer to ensure that he or she gets a good deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend said but we are straying a little from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady trumpington said in opening this second reading debate this bill is a joint initiative between maff and the department of health <e> <s> therefore in winding up i shall make every effort to respond to the many and varied questions and issues that have been raised concerning both my noble friends ministry and the department of health <e> <s> i shall also deal with matters relating to the territorial departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble lord on that point <e> <s> it is certainly our intention and that was the objective in setting up this body <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> if the authority finds it necessary to provide a certain service and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might write to the noble lord on that point <e> <s> i was about to say <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the reply i gave to the noble lord <e> <s> that is my information <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we shall consider the very reasonable arguments which have just been made in this respect <e> <s> this bill is about providing the framework for treatment to help parents have the children that they so desperately want <e> <s> in deciding whether the treatment is right in individual cases the future of any children will need to be considered very carefully indeed <e> <s> we shall be asking the authority to make sure that it is satisfied that those providing treatment give this aspect proper consideration <e> <s> so the stability of the home into which a child is to be born will undoubtedly be a consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords we are informed that about one in of the population today has a father other than the one named on the birth certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords it will always be open to any member of your lordships house to table such an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble earl no firm assurance on that point but i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend and others concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i also imagine that they would do so <e> <s> perhaps i can confirm otherwise if that should be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the government are committed to modernising and improving national health buildings <e> <s> we have sustained a high level of capital investment in the national health service <e> <s> capital investment for next year will be about billion of which about billion is to be spent on buildings <e> <s> further as my noble friend is aware in the current year that is we estimate that over new health building schemes each costing over million will be brought into use <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised an important point about getting the right balance between modernising and replacing existing stock <e> <s> of course it is ultimately for the regional health authorities to decide such matters <e> <s> however the department monitors the national health service estate to ensure that the right balance is maintained <e> <s> generally speaking however we would say that new hospitals are capable of operating more efficiently <e> <s> they provide a better health care environment for patients and more attractive and productive working conditions for staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have specific figures concerning the number of hospital beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the short answer is that we are being more efficient and successful in our treatment <e> <s> i have come across some figures which might be helpful to your lordships <e> <s> although the number of beds was reduced from in to in activity has increased by per cent <e> <s> patients are now being treated per available bed compared with in <e> <s> i think that that is the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps i may supplement what he said by pointing out that although some hospital units have closed during the past years as i said in my answer more than building schemes have been introduced over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords when we talk about the reduction in the number of beds we are not talking about a reduction in the number of patients <e> <s> i stated that there was a quicker turnover of patients and they were therefore being dealt with more efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a separate question <e> <s> i am pleased to hear mention of the subject from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always a nimby syndrome <e> <s> i believe that if the noble lord spoke to people in areas such as barrow-in-furness st albans eastbourne medway bournemouth bristol stoke-on-trent and stirling where major new hospital developments have taken place they would hear a more satisfied response <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the important point is to achieve the right balance <e> <s> the monitoring carried out by the department is intended to do that <e> <s> if i find that i have some specific figures which i can give to my noble friend i shall let him have them <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention is that the best possible use should be made of existing facilities <e> <s> i believe that the figures that i have already quoted on the use of hospital beds proves this <e> <s> we are doing our utmost to help the relevant regional health authorities and the district health authorities in order to ensure that no closures take place <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in to the national health service in the united kingdom will have an increase in resources equivalent to billion <e> <s> gross expenditure will be billion compared with just over billion in to <e> <s> this additional funding will be used to maintain develop and improve existing services <e>", "<cs> my lords within the increase that i have referred to around million will fund developments connected with the implementation of proposals contained in the national health service and community care bill <e> <s> these will include the costs of the first doctors appointed under the consultants initiative in england the establishment of a comprehensive medical audit system the extension of the resource management initiative the costs of establishing the first group of self-governing hospitals the introduction of the capital system training for a wide range of staff groups additional finance and personnel staff <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to a previous question the government are spending more on the national health service than ever before <e> <s> the additional funds that the government have provided are intended to be sufficient to allow services to be increased by more than would be needed simply to keep pace with the growing numbers of elderly people for example the question of whether this is enough assumes that the demand for health care is a fixed figure that can be measured <e> <s> that is clearly nonsense <e> <s> what is important is that the extra funds provided show the priority that the government have given to health service spending within public spending generally <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in resources for the national health service as a whole in the uk will be equivalent to a cash increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> and a real terms increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> i think that is good news <e>", "<cs> my lords that question strays a little from the question before us <e> <s> however i can reassure the noble lord that my department is continuing to co-operate with the health education authority in the important areas to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are looking at that aspect <e> <s> that area of community care is a very important part of the governments current programme of reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments programme of reforms is intended to ensure that local needs are met through the structures that are available to assess the needs of particular communities <e> <s> i believe that once that programme has been fully implemented the noble lords anxieties will be met <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem of alcohol abuse is one of my departmental responsibilities <e> <s> the noble lord may be sure that i shall take note of his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord ennals and lord bonham-carter for their welcome of this order <e> <s> i wish to thank the noble lord lord ennals on behalf of the census staff for his kind tribute which i fully endorse both as regards their quality and efficacy <e> <s> as regards the question of numbers of staff involved at this point in addition to several hundred permanent staff in the census offices we shall be employing about temporary field staff <e> <s> i understand that about of those will be enumerators who will be responsible for the delivery of over million forms <e> <s> there will also be about temporary processing staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ennals for having given me advance warning of his new year question to me <e> <s> beyond that while i appreciate his difficulties over the name i suggest that it is open to him to use the full title <e> <s> he can refer to it at all times as the unrelated live transplant regulatory authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that not only can it consider recommendations but it can make them to ministers on policies <e>", "<cs> my lords the screening of elderly patients in particular which is proposed in the new gp contracts will go some way to meet the noble lords anxiety <e> <s> we encourage testing and dispensing services in community centres in order to cope with geographical problems but under the control of the hospital unit <e> <s> if gps have the necessary expertise and equipment there is no reason why that service should not be carried out by them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we believe that the national health service hearing aid service has provided and continues to provide a very good service <e> <s> as a result of the proposals announced last year by my right honourable friend we shall be looking to increased co-ordination <e> <s> as regards choice of hearing aids there is a wide range of national health service hearing aids available to meet a variety of needs <e> <s> in a few cases however a patients clinical need may only be met by a commercial hearing aid which may be purchased and supplied free of charge to the patient by the national health service hearing aid centre <e>", "<cs> my lords as said testing outside hospitals will continue to take place whether in community centres or via gps under the control of the hospital unit <e> <s> therefore we have no plans at present to make the kind of arrangements that the noble baroness suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords what said was that there is a wide range of hearing aids available under the national health service <e> <s> in fact the mersey regional health authority which is responsible for the procurement and distribution of all national health service hearing aids has recently negotiated with the hearing aid industry for a reduction in the <e>", "<cs> my lords our firm intention and i wish to emphasise it is that national health service hearing aids should remain free at the point of issue <e> <s> the vast majority of hearing aids come within that definition which is being expanded as a result of the procurement and distribution arrangements being made by the mersey regional health authority <e> <s> we certainly hope to have the widest possible choice available for patients <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lady for her explanation of the proposed amendment <e> <s> i fully understand her desire to clarify the position at this stage <e> <s> nevertheless i feel sure that she does not wish to step backwards in regard to protecting the consumer <e> <s> in fact she admitted that the amendment may not achieve what she intends <e>", "<cs> the charity itself not the premises would be liable if there was any problem with food poisoning <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with the aim of the amendment since the whole of the bill which we are now considering has as its objective the supply of safe food <e> <s> we believe that the bill will achieve that objective in a number of ways <e> <s> first of course it will be an offence to supply food which does not meet food safety requirements <e> <s> secondly we shall be making regulations under the enabling powers in the bill which will among other things improve the standards of hygiene in food businesses and ensure that people handling food are trained in hygienic practices <e> <s> we believe that the provisions of the bill will achieve the aim of the noble lords who tabled the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall try to supply the information requested by the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> while i recognise his concern that the terms lot and consignment can go wide it is an important provision which must be fully retained <e> <s> the expressions batch lot and consignment can have separate meanings <e> <s> the first batch tends to mean similar foods produced at the same time under the same conditions <e> <s> the second lot could be a collection of batches <e> <s> the third consignment could mean a group of products which are being moved at the same time for example a lorry load <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with my noble friends intention which is to ensure that local authorities restrict their enforcement action to food which is genuinely suspected of being unsafe <e> <s> however i can assure the committee that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> local authorities already have the power to seize and detain food which has not been inspected and clause does not contain anything new in this respect <e> <s> local authorities use this power to detain suspect food if the grounds for suspicion do not arise from an inspection but from some other cause such as an outbreak of food poisoning associated with a particular food an important consideration <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asks why we cannot have precisely the same wording as in the consumer protection act <e> <s> i wonder why we cannot have precisely the same words as in the food act on which a substantial body of case law has been built up and with which both enforcement officers and magistrates are familiar <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concerns that have given rise to this amendment which are to ensure that food authorities are competent to recognise when food is likely to cause food poisoning <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this important point <e> <s> clearly we need to ensure that the owners of food which has been seized <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has explained this amendment seeks to prohibit a justice dealing with a prosecution where he has been involved in the initial condemnation of food <e> <s> in spite of the explanation given by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i assure my noble friend that we do not intend that food should be condemned or taken before the justice of the peace if the food can be made safe <e> <s> under current legislation the owner of the food has the right to appear in court and to call witnesses to make a case against condemnation <e> <s> that right will continue under the bill <e> <s> if the owner wishes to subject the food to further processing he must say so <e> <s> if he convinces the magistrate that in all the circumstances the food is safe the magistrate will not condemn the food <e> <s> in fact magistrates and enforcement officers already have a body of case law to guide them in this area as well as their own common sense <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for her explanation of the amendment and i note the support given to it by other noble lords <e> <s> local authorities are already required to pay compensation to cover any depreciation in the value of the food resulting from a seizure if the food is not condemned <e> <s> this provision will continue under clause <e> <s> i believe that the provision strikes the right balance between the need to protect food businesses from wrongful seizure of their property and the need to ensure that enforcement officers are not deterred from seizing suspect food by the threat of a hefty compensation bill <e>", "<cs> while i sympathise with the intentions of the noble lord lord tordoff in tabling these amendments i believe that they are unnecessary and that they could be harmful <e> <s> i shall speak first to amendment no <e> <s> which concerns clause <e> <s> if the seizure of food led to a prosecution under clause the details of the seizure would become public knowledge in court <e> <s> the amendment would not add anything in that case <e> <s> on the other hand if the notice detaining food pending investigation is withdrawn or the magistrate finds in favour of the owner of the food it would be quite wrong to make details of any such detention public <e> <s> to do so would damage the owners reputation as we were reminded when we discussed this matter in connection with the last amendment even though he had not been found guilty of an offence <e> <s> i cannot believe that members of the committee would wish to support such a provision <e>", "<cs> clause gives powers to inspect detain or seize food suspected of not complying with food safety requirements and to condemn food which does not comply with food safety requirements <e> <s> the clause combines and strengthens the powers which already exist under sections and of the food act which allow a councils authorised officer to examine food intended for human consumption and seize it if he suspects that it is unfit for human consumption and likely to cause a disease communicable to humans or food poisoning <e> <s> he has then to notify the person in whose possession the food was found and take it before a justice of the peace who decides whether the food should be destroyed <e> <s> if the justice of the peace decides that the food should not be destroyed the authority is to compensate the owner <e> <s> however the current system is not sufficiently flexible to allow enforcement officers to choose a course of action appropriate to the circumstances of the particular case <e> <s> clause therefore includes some additional powers <e>", "<cs> although we are concerned to ensure that defective food premises are brought up to standard we do not intend to involve food businesses in unnecessary expense <e> <s> this is particularly important to the smaller business <e> <s> therefore i am happy to accept the principle of this amendment <e> <s> however i am sure that my noble friends will understand and hopefully agree that it is vital to ensure that the drafting of the clause fully achieves our aim <e> <s> i should therefore like to take more time to consider the wording and return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his proposal <e> <s> regrettably i cannot accept it <e> <s> the minimum period laid down in clause for compliance with an improvement notice is days <e> <s> i am informed by technical experts that for most purposes days is ample <e> <s> environmental health officers are not unreasonable people <e> <s> the clause gives them a discretion to allow such longer period as may be required <e> <s> if steps were required which were complicated a longer period would be allowed <e> <s> in many cases days could be more than sufficent to enable matters likely to be the subject of an improvement notice to be put right <e> <s> unlike some of the examples quoted by my noble friend they would mostly be minor matters which could be rapidly put right <e> <s> i trust that in the light of that assurance my noble friend will not insist upon his amendment <e>", "<cs> this may be a small amendment in the opinion of my noble friend but it would effectively remove the teeth from the improvement notice procedure <e> <s> the committee will be aware that we consider that procedure to be very important <e> <s> it will raise standards of hygiene in food businesses <e> <s> prosecuting an offender may not be such an effective way of raising standards as we believe the improvement notice procedure to be <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with the intention of my noble friend which is to safeguard proprietors from being forced to go to unnecessary expense by overzealous enforcement officers <e>", "<cs> the use of shall or may has taken up a considerable amount of your lordships time over the years <e> <s> perhaps i may begin my response with all due deference by trying to explain why we have used the word shall instead of the word may <e>", "<cs> one of our main aims in this bill is to catch the real offender <e> <s> this applies to prohibition notices as much as it does to any other provision <e> <s> i assure the committee that it is not our intention to prohibit an entire company from carrying on a food business because of an offence committed in a single outlet which may not be typical of the company as a whole <e> <s> perhaps i should have reassured my noble friend lord mottistone more specifically on this point in the course of our discussion on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be able to say that my noble friend has convinced me he has a good case <e> <s> i agree that it would be very unfair to <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has raised two very fair points which once again i feel i can accept in principle <e> <s> it is important as i said in replying to the previous amendment that businesses which no longer present a risk to health should not be forced to remain closed for longer than is reasonable while the enforcement authority makes up its mind about them <e> <s> fourteen days does not seem an unreasonable time to allow them to do this <e>", "<cs> i regret that in this case i cannot accept my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i understand his concern that the definition of injury as it appears in clause may seem too wide <e> <s> i cannot see however that substituting the word danger for injury would help in any way <e> <s> both words amount to more or less the same thing <e> <s> the government are concerned to ensure the proper protection of the public <e> <s> i am not sure that i could in any case support any substantial weakening of these provisions <e> <s> for the reasons which were explained earlier i hope my noble friend will understand that the concept of injury to health is by no means as wide as he fears although it is wide enough to cover circumstances where emergency action is required <e> <s> in the light of my remarks i trust that my noble friend will not wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> in spite of the support for my noble friend i am afraid that i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> courts normal sitting days are weekdays <e> <s> we see no reason for departing from usual practice in this case <e> <s> these days therefore cannot be counted as sitting days for the purposes of the clause <e> <s> however i would point out that businesses are able to insure themselves against losses sustained in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> i believe that the loss of perishable food under those circumstances is an insurable risk <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter in the context of my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for his explanation of the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> i can certainly give him the assurance that we intend to aim at the highest standards <e> <s> however i regret that i can not accept his amendment because the effect of it is unclear <e>", "<cs> the bill already contains powers for us to require registers under regulations and to require such registers to be open to the public at all reasonable times <e> <s> we shall be considering how to make use of this power in devising the regulations on registration of food premises on which all interested parties will be fully consulted <e> <s> our intention like that of the noble lord lord tordoff is to ensure that the public is properly informed about food safety <e>", "<cs> the register of food premises will contain a very limited amount of information such as the address of the premises as my noble friend suggested the nature and size of the business and the name of the proprietor <e> <s> it will not include detailed information on the running of the business <e> <s> we believe that allowing the public access to the register has three major advantages <e> <s> first it will benefit the consumer because he or she will be able to check whether or not premises are known to the local authority and therefore whether or not the authority is monitoring hygiene standards <e> <s> secondly it will benefit the industry <e> <s> reputable businesses sometimes suspect that they are being undercut by unscrupulous traders who cut corners on safety to keep down prices <e> <s> if they have access to the register they will be able to check whether or not those premises are registered <e> <s> if they are not the occupants may deliberately be trying to avoid inspection <e> <s> at any rate the reputable trader will be able to do something about it <e> <s> finally we believe that public access will lead to better standards of enforcement as any gaps in the local authoritys knowledge can be filled by the public <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require food authorities to provide facilities for the microbiological examination of food samples <e> <s> we believe that to require them to do so would be unnecessary and would entail a waste of resources <e>", "<cs> the amendment introduces the concept of an investigation alongside that of analysis and examination <e> <s> but there is no indication of what happens with a sample taken from an investigation <e> <s> the purpose of this and subsequent provisions of the bill is to provide an orderly framework for the gathering of evidence to be put before a court <e> <s> that evidence is gathered in such a way that the court can be assured as to its expertise and validity <e> <s> we believe that amendment would leave a loose end in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> enforcement officers are entitled to take photographs during their investigations into food law offences just as any citizen can take photographs subject to specific prohibitions <e> <s> the absence of an express provision in existing law should not have prevented them from doing this to date <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill which will prevent them from continuing to do so <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment is also unnecessary <e> <s> by virtue of the interpretation act one month would be interpreted as one calendar month <e> <s> that is a convenient approach since it means that a warrant issued say the third day of one month will expire by the third day of the following month whatever the length of the month may be <e> <s> one month is used for the lifetime of a warrant in current legislation and also in other consumer protection measures <e> <s> that works perfectly well <e>", "<cs> our proposal in the bill is to enable officers to seize evidence for production in court hence the seizing of originals is more appropriate than taking copies <e> <s> nevertheless if the proprietor needs copies they would and could be supplied to him <e> <s> the power to inspect and seize the originals implies a power to take copies too and has always been interpreted in that way <e> <s> i therefore hope that the noble viscount will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope i am always sympathetic <e> <s> we always look very hard at amendments which are put before us <e> <s> however we believe that this amendment once again is unnecessary <e> <s> examination of records will take place only when relevant to the enforcement of the bill and any regulations or orders made thereunder when the contravention or suspected contravention is being investigated <e> <s> we do not believe that it is necessary to limit further an authorised officers powers <e> <s> i trust therefore that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the powers of entry of authorised officers are limited to those set out in clause <e> <s> inspectors will therefore be able to examine records only relating to the activities covered by the food act and regulations or orders made thereunder <e>", "<cs> clause already provides for the prosecution of anyone who obstructs or fails to assist the enforcement officer in the execution of his duties without reasonable cause <e> <s> it is therefore implied that an enforcement officer would be able to require any person to assist him in carrying out his duties <e> <s> i note the reference made by the noble lord lord gallacher to the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act but my understanding is that that act is unusual in containing such a provision <e> <s> therefore i trust that in the light of the assurance i have given in respect of clause the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for tabling this amendment but i believe that it is inappropriate <e> <s> the time limits of three years from commission/one year from discovery mirror to a large extent the existing provisions in the food act although i recognise that without the previous time constraints on the handling of samples they will bite more in the future <e> <s> however i believe our proposals strike the right balance <e> <s> they allow sufficient time for enforcement authorities to prepare a case but still require the case to be taken to court within a reasonable period <e> <s> these time limits are completely in accord with those found in other consumer protection legislation such as the trade descriptions act and the consumer protection act <e>", "<cs> despite what the noble viscount and my noble friend have said i feel it is difficult to justify an increase in the penalty for an offence which in itself is not a contravention of the main provisions <e> <s> in determining what levels of penalty are appropriate the possible motive for an offence should not be relevant <e> <s> we have in any case increased the penalty which is currently available for comparable offences in the food act <e> <s> at present there is only a maximum of a fine and no possibility of imprisonment <e>", "<cs> i accept that an improvement notice may contain a number of different deficiencies all of which need to be put right <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that clause already allows an aggrieved person to appeal against the individual requirements of an improvement notice <e> <s> her amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i commend my noble friend for his most thorough scrutiny of the bill which brought this typing error to light <e> <s> i have no hesitation in accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a complex subject and i shall endeavour to describe as clearly as possible the procedure <e> <s> an enforcement officer may serve an emergency prohibition notice on the proprietor of a food business if he is satisfied that it presents an imminent risk of danger to health <e> <s> the wording is important because it means that he cannot serve an emergency prohibition notice merely on suspicion and it also means that the danger must be unusually great <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining the error in her amendment <e> <s> we believe that the provisions of the bill are necessary because it is often important to have seized food dealt with quickly especially if there is a large quantity of it <e> <s> the need for rapid action arises because of the risk that the food could otherwise be used for human consumption <e> <s> it could also deteriorate substantially if there were delay <e>", "<cs> i assure the committee that declaring a council to be in default is not a decision which the government would take lightly <e> <s> clause permits ministers to hold a local inquiry first and when the facts were in doubt we would normally do so <e> <s> however there are occasions when the time and expense of a local inquiry could not be justified <e> <s> for example in an emergency the government might need to take immediate action to protect public health <e> <s> alternatively a local authority might be quite prepared to admit that it was in default for example if it were unable to provide a service because its employees were on strike <e>", "<cs> on the general point as the committee will be aware the affirmative procedure places heavy demands on the time of this place and of another place and is by convention reserved for powers substantially affecting provisions of acts of parliament and powers to increase taxation or other financial burdens or other especially important powers such as those creating new varieties of serious criminal offences <e> <s> i do not believe that any of the order-making and regulation-making powers in the bill fall into any of those categories <e>", "<cs> we believe that to accept this amendment would seriously weaken the proposed powers in the bill to ensure that processes are safe <e> <s> the provision we are discussing will enable us to ensure that the food producer has identified the critical control points and parameters where necessary obtaining expert advice <e> <s> that will ensure his product is safe and that he is carrying out his process accordingly <e>", "<cs> we are of course most grateful for the helpful suggestions that have been made in this respect <e> <s> the committee will have seen that clause gives ministers fairly broad powers to make regulations on aspects of food safety and consumer protection <e> <s> schedule simply spells out some of the things that may be included in the regulations <e> <s> many of these are contained in existing legislation but some are new <e>", "<cs> my lords part of the final offer which was made on th december included a complete review of the arrangements which aim at maximum flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that the last review of the salary structure was made in when ambulancemen and women got an exceptionally good deal at the introduction of the new salary structure <e> <s> it cost a lot more then than the generality of other pay settlements <e> <s> since then and including the present final offer the real value of that deal has been more than maintained <e> <s> in addition the standard working week has been reduced by one hour <e>", "<cs> my lords we have indeed noted that members of the british labour group in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord in his basic premise that high settlements anywhere without compensating productivity gains undermine competitiveness and cost jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe the whitley council machinery is the appropriate machinery in this case <e> <s> i have to say that the main ambulance unions have consistently refused to negotiate on the final offer made on th december last year <e> <s> at the only joint meeting since then it was rejected out of hand without discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot understand why nupe and its associated unions keep insisting that the final offer is still only per cent <e> <s> when everybody has said as plainly as they can that it is at least per cent <e> <s> backdated to st april <e> <s> that means that a qualified ambulanceman or woman would get back pay to the end of december of up to and up to in london <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe i just said it is not per cent <e> <s> the noble lord must remember that this offer was made almost a year ago it relates to april last year <e> <s> it coincides very well with other agreements made within the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that most reasonable point <e> <s> as i said previously it is a better offer than that accepted by over other staff also doing important work in the health service the offer having been made on the same basis <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for raising that point <e> <s> in an organisation where pay accounts for over per cent <e> <s> of costs it is essential that nhs management retains control of the amounts that it pays out for salaries and wages <e> <s> it has to ensure that pay awards do not divert resources from patient care <e>", "<cs> my lords in looking to the future we are looking for greater flexibility <e> <s> we recognise that a modern ambulance service needs to reward the use of additional paramedical skills <e> <s> that is why the current offer includes an additional per annum for staff with extended training to national health service training authority standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not given the impression of complacency <e> <s> i have pointed out that the very great importance we attach to these negotiations is in order to ensure that pay awards do not divert resources from patient care <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving me notice of the first part of his question <e> <s> i have to make the point that the christmas recess period intervened <e> <s> my right honourable friend appreciated the offer of a meeting but as i understand he made clear in his reply matters had moved on since the letter was written <e> <s> management had by then made the final offer of th december which included the per cent <e> <s> basic increase over the -month period an additional for paramedical staff and the other factors that i have already touched upon this afternoon <e> <s> unfortunately i did not see the panorama programme to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> however with regard to editing arrangements not all that one reads in the newspapers should be taken at face value <e>", "<cs> my lords the national rate for a qualified ambulanceman is currently <e> <s> in ondon a qualified ambulanceman earns per annum <e> <s> those are basic rates <e> <s> individuals may have take-home pay that varies <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i made it clear that i did not see the programme <e> <s> i therefore did not hear or see anything <e> <s> nevertheless as a general premise i am sure that the noble lord will accept what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords no negotiators whether in the public or private sector can be expected to go into pay negotiations with a blank cheque <e> <s> the national health service management agrees with ministers the extent of the negotiating limits for various staff groups <e> <s> how these are used is for the management side to determine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for informing the house that the national health service as an employer is second only to the red army <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for drawing attention to the very encouraging trend in the provision of direct patient care <e> <s> the number of ancillary staff has fallen by per cent <e> <s> and although administrative and clerical staff have risen by per cent <e> <s> the nursing and midwifery medical and dental staff have risen by per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively <e> <s> i believe those are very encouraging figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusions i draw from the figures and indeed other figures are that they are proof that we are spending more on our national health service than ever before proof that we have more doctors in the national health service than ever before and proof that even taking account of the reduction in nurses working hours nursing staffs have increased by per cent <e> <s> since which must speak volumes for our patient care <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will realise with technical advances many of the treatments that have to be provided are far more expensive than they were <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for making that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the nursing campaign has proved to be successful <e> <s> we are in the process of fully implementing the recommendations of the krner steering group on health service information which will provide us with more information on nursing trends <e>", "<cs> my lords what is interesting about the increase in the number of administrative and clerical staff to which i referred is that the major increase is in relation to the direct support <e>", "<cs> my lords we have an important programme of education and training going forward <e> <s> perhaps i can cheer up the noble lord by saying that as a result of the improvement in the ratio between consultants and junior doctors a greater proportion of medical care is given by fully-trained doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak for my noble friend but i am sure that he did not intend to be disparaging about the important work done by many ancillary staff <e> <s> the decrease in staff of nearly between and represents a reduction of per cent <e> <s> to which i referred <e> <s> that decrease reflects a more efficient use of staff in this area and the effects of competitive tendering <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i give the noble lord an assurance that i shall give the house the best information available at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the encouraging trend in hospital care is towards more day care in order to avoid the unnecessary use of beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that therapists come within the category of professions allied to medicine <e> <s> in terms of statistics i believe that they come within the definition of medical staff <e> <s> manpower requirements are a matter for local bids and for the regions to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that in part that is due to the fact that expectations are increasing and there are new methods of treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always delighted to try to help the noble lord <e> <s> i can tell him that my right honourable friend the secretary of state assures me that he was referring to a two-tier ambulance service within the national health service as being the way forward <e> <s> i see nothing in our national health service proposals to suggest otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all anxious about the future of our health service which is why the government are introducing the reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that i cannot agree with the noble lord on that point <e> <s> there is no provision for independent arbitration in any nhs pay agreements <e> <s> the nhs management must retain control of the amounts that it pays out in salaries and wages <e> <s> it has to ensure that pay awards do not divert resources from patient care <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> of the nhs staff have settled their pay question without recourse to industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course correct <e> <s> spending on the nhs is now at an all-time high <e> <s> it is up by per cent <e> <s> in real terms under this government <e> <s> next year spending will be nearly per cent <e> <s> higher in real terms than it was in <e> <s> the proportion of gdp spent on the nhs and per capita spending are both higher than they were years ago <e> <s> as was made evident in a question tabled by my noble friend lord orr-ewing last week the numbers of medical staff have also increased most encouragingly <e>", "<cs> my lords the waiting list initiative which was backed by the million waiting list fund has been successful in enabling hundreds of thousands of patients on the waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which figures the noble lord is referring <e> <s> would they be the figures quoted in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if my noble friend would repeat that question <e> <s> i am not sure that i caught it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it we shall have an opportunity to debate the subject of the ambulancemen a little more thoroughly in the near future because an unstarred question on the subject has been tabled <e> <s> the governments position is that the final pay offer i do not understand why nupe and its associated unions keep insisting that the final offer is still only per cent <e> <s> is of at least per cent <e> <s> backdated to st april <e> <s> that is the offer which is on the table and the management side has always shown itself willing to meet to discuss that final offer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on previous occasions it is not the custom for the secretary of state to become involved in such disputes it is for the management side to settle with the ambulancemen and their representatives <e> <s> as i said previously the management side has always been ready to meet on any occasion <e> <s> a number of meetings have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that there is perfectly adequate negotiating machinery in place and that that machinery should be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to that is a repetition of my previous answer <e> <s> the whitley council is the machinery for that negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always made it clear that we are anxious to see an end to this unfortunate dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble baroness that there has been no increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in this country <e> <s> nevertheless we recognise that people with aids are vulnerable to tuberculosis <e> <s> it can be the first manifestation of the problem <e> <s> however they themselves should not be given bcg because it may cause widespread disease in those who are immunosuppressed <e> <s> a high level of protection from the bcg vaccination in young people in the community is therefore all the more important now because of the higher incidence of hiv-positive people <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the uk suppliers evans pharmaceuticals had production problems because of a change of location <e>", "<cs> my lords no problems have arisen in the past over the bcg vaccine <e> <s> the uk manufacturer is now resuming production <e> <s> this is a good product which is exported to other parts of the world <e> <s> no other uk manufacturer has sought a licence to manufacture it <e> <s> if overseas suppliers sought to do so the necessary licensing arrangements exist in order to make sure that clinical trials support the application <e>", "<cs> my lords there are other world suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot supply my noble friend with the comparative figures but i can say that notifications in england and wales have declined from in to in in and approximately in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the separate figures but if they are available i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the average total cost of bcg vaccine for to was <e> <s> i understand that the programme that is applied

there were adequate supplies for high risk groups <e> <s> that was done <e> <s> we were confident that the high risk groups were fully catered for and that there would only be a short postponement of the schools programme <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not do that because as i mentioned there are considerable importing and licensing procedures involved <e> <s> any non-uk supplier would have to apply for a product licence and might have to conduct the necessary clinical trials to support the application <e> <s> we were confident that we were covered for the high risk groups and that only a short postponement of the schools programme was involved <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always grateful to the noble lord for giving us the benefit of his expert advice <e> <s> the fact that the incidence of the disease is continuing to decrease proves his point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that as communications have improved the incidence of travel has increased <e> <s> recently arrived immigrants from developing countries for example are considered to come within the high risk groups i mentioned because of the high prevalence of tuberculosis in those countries <e>", "<cs> the government believe that it is not appropriate that this treatment known as gamete intra-fallopian transfer or gift should as such be regulated by the bill <e> <s> in considering which treatments to regulate the government applied two general tests <e> <s> the first was whether treatments involved the creation of a human embryo outside the body <e> <s> the second was whether in other cases the treatment involved donated or stored gametes or embryos <e> <s> in each case the process raises important questions like disposal consent and legal status which need to be addressed as they have many legal consequences <e> <s> it is for this reason that the four treatments to be regulated by the bill need statutory control <e>", "<cs> i believe that comes within the clinical judgment of the doctor concerned to which i referred before and which is applicable to many other forms of treatment as well <e>", "<cs> we shall look at the amendment in the light of the arguments advanced by noble lords <e> <s> we shall look at it perhaps particularly in terms of the spirit of the amendment as the noble lord lord walton suggested and no doubt we shall return to the subject at a future stage <e>", "<cs> this amendment would allow the secretary of state to limit the number of women who could be treated with the eggs of a particular woman or the sperm of a particular man <e> <s> the govenment argued in the white paper that while it was desirable to have limits on sperm donations there would be significant practical difficulties in trying to enforce any such limit <e> <s> recovery of eggs for a woman is a less easy procedure than the obtaining of sperm <e> <s> it is in the governments view unnecessary to legislate on what is again essentially <e>", "<cs> we discussed the substance of the amendment when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the two cases which are permitted by the bill as was established the ultimate safeguard is that the embryo resulting from the process must be destroyed immediately <e> <s> for those reasons the governments view is that it would be inequitable to restrict the number of premises which could be licensed to carry out the activity and therefore i trust that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much understand the reasons which have prompted this amendment <e> <s> the government made it clear in the white paper that the membership of the human fertilisation and embryology authority would be likely to include people with wide knowledge and experience in the fields mentioned in the amendment <e> <s> however the government think it would be wrong if these categories were specifically mentioned in paragraph of schedule as not only would this unduly tie the hands of the secretary of state in choosing the right balance of membership when he comes to do that but also there are people who are members of other disciplines which like nursing and counselling could make an equal claim to being appointed to the authority <e>", "<cs> the short discussion on the amendment has been useful <e> <s> i believe that if it were accepted it would prove axiomatic in practice <e> <s> in appointing the members as the white paper indicated the secretary of state will wish to ensure that the authority represents a mixed and balanced set of views <e> <s> that said i can assure the committee that it is not the governments intention to appoint an authority packed with those who are partisan on <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> under paragraph of schedule to the bill as it at present stands at least a third but no more than half of the members of the authority with the exception of the chairman and deputy chairman shall either be registered medical practitioners or scientists involved in embryology <e> <s> it is highly unlikely that ministers would seek to appoint that portion of the membership exclusively from among people who are involved in embryo research if that should be parliaments decision <e> <s> equally the white papers proposals about the membership of the authority stress that it will need to include a majority of people who are lay <e> <s> thus it is likely that in practice the bill as at present drafted will secure what the amendment seeks to achieve <e>", "<cs> the arguments of my noble friend lord jellicoe are very convincing <e> <s> indeed he and other members of this chamber raised the point about annual reports in the course of the second reading debate <e>", "<cs> the amendments seeks to define more precisely the balance of membership of licence committees to be set up by the authority <e> <s> as clause is at present drafted it specifies that at least one member shall be lay in the sense of not being someone authorised to participate in an activity to be licenced under the bill <e> <s> the amendment would require a majority of non-medical or scientific members or those authorised to carry out licensed activities <e>", "<cs> i presume so <e> <s> as i understand it and as i am advised suitable in this context means medically suitable <e> <s> that must take into account i imagine such things as temperature <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord adrian pointed out the provision in the bill is designed to take account of new treatments which may become available and the government believe it is right to make provision for possible future advances in fertility treatment <e> <s> the rapid advances in techniques even since the publication of the warnock report in show how difficult it is to forecast now everything that may be possible even in a few years time <e> <s> in the governments view therefore it would not be desirable to have to wait for new principal legislation in every case <e>", "<cs> i fully recognise the noble lords concern in this matter and the apparent desirability of having some kind of agreed list of conditions <e> <s> i note with interest the mrcs support for the idea of having some list of priorities <e> <s> however in the light of the arguments that have been advanced in the course of our discussions on the bill so far we all recognise that there are very rapid advances in techniques and increasing knowledge in this area so that any attempt to define priorities at a particular stage in itself would impose particular difficulties <e>", "<cs> i should start by saying to my noble friend lord lauderdale that everything that is contained in the bill is not totally dependent upon being mentioned in the warnock report because the report came out some years ago and as we have already established a number of changes in techniques and practices have developed in the intervening period <e> <s> any measure is not totally dependent on what is in the white paper <e> <s> nevertheless if my noble friend looks at annex b of the white paper he will see that paragraph c refers to suggested benefits of research which include developing more effective forms of contraception <e> <s> it is therefore in this case mentioned in the white paper <e>", "<cs> i was labouring under the delusion that this amendment was grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and which we previously discussed <e> <s> i believe that the consequences of the noble lords amendment are as stated in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> i consider that there is no advantage in the amendment moved by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> as i understand it the consents are given by the two people involved whether they are married or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends for tabling these amendments <e> <s> the argument may have been clear at an earlier stage but the amendment was not <e> <s> a period of days should be long enough to allow a local authority to carry out the necessary tests <e> <s> i believe that these amendments strike the right balance between the needs of the enforcement authority and the owner of the food <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall a previous discussion on a similar amendment at the previous stage of the bill <e> <s> i suggest that the paragraph which my noble friend now wishes to remove does not tell the bench what to do but merely makes it clear that two options are open to it <e> <s> i believe it would be a retrograde step to remove a paragraph which clarifies the position of magistrates <e> <s> it seems to me that such a paragraph can only be beneficial to them <e> <s> on that basis again i cannot accept the amendment of my noble friend on this occasion too <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make sure that my noble friend lady trumpington is aware of the point made by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for tabling a revised version of the amendment which she moved in committee <e> <s> i am satisfied that the amendment will achieve our aim of ensuring that defective food premises are brought up to standard while at the same time ensuring that undue burdens are not placed on food businesses <e> <s> i am therefore happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the purpose behind the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> however i believe it to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend pointed out i said in committee that we would review clause carefully to ensure that a court could not prohibit an entire company from carrying on a food business because of an offence committed in a single outlet which may not be typical of the company as a whole <e> <s> i can reassure my noble friend that we have done so and that the provisions of amendment no <e> <s> will meet his concern <e> <s> i shall not repeat my introduction of the amendment here but assume that it will reassure my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble lord that it is not our intention that proprietors should have less responsibility in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not our intention to produce the effect that my noble friend discovered and raised with us at a previous stage <e> <s> i am happy to accept my noble friends amendments which put it beyond all doubt that for the purposes of enforcement scottish bank holidays are disregarded in scotland and english bank holidays are disregarded in england <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of these amendments would be to remove from the bill all references to microbiological examination and to food examiners <e> <s> there would then be no statutory backing for the activity of microbiological examination <e> <s> that is a different and separate activity from the chemical analysis of food <e> <s> both tasks require a high level of experience competence and expertise <e> <s> the fact that the tasks are separate does not of course mean that they cannot be undertaken by the same person assuming he or she is appropriately qualified in both disciplines <e>", "<cs> my lords improvement notices serviced under clause are issued by appropriate officers who are authorised by the enforcement authority <e> <s> any action by the officer concerned must therefore be deemed to be with the approval of the authority <e> <s> in some authorities these decisions are taken only by senior officers <e> <s> if the authority is small the appeal envisaged by the amendment might end up being made to the same officer who made the original decision <e> <s> that surely cannot be right <e> <s> the proper procedure for any appeal is to the magistrates court or in the case of scotland to the sheriff <e> <s> that secures the independence of the procedure <e> <s> it has to be fair and we believe that it has to be seen to be fair <e> <s> i hope in view of that explanation that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the governments policy on surrogacy is contained in the surrogacy arrangements act to which this amendment <e>", "<cs> we recognise the concern about fees and in particular concerning the points raised in the course of this brief discussion <e> <s> nevertheless we think it right that applicants for licences should meet not necessarily the whole cost but a significant part of the cost of the process of licensing <e> <s> though references were made to examples of free services i remind the committee that fee-paying is an established practice in other fields if not within the national health service <e> <s> for example there are planning applications and licences under the medicines act <e>", "<cs> i should clarify one point <e> <s> the examples that i quoted in relation to other areas where licence fees are applicable are more similar to this case than the other services within the national health service to which noble lords have referred <e> <s> in this case we are talking about fees payable not by the individuals who wish to go in for the ivf treatment but by institutions which wish to carry out that course of treatment and have to apply under the bill to the authority for permission to do so <e> <s> the exact analogy that i have been asked to give is not appropriate <e>", "<cs> i recognise the antipathy of the noble lord lord ennals to any charges in the national health service even those imposed upon people who can well afford to pay them <e> <s> nevertheless i think that it is important in this <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that i am not in a position to give the noble lord detailed figures at this point <e>", "<cs> we believe that the amendment is unnecessary since the information to which the noble viscount referred is already held by the authority <e> <s> the noble viscount himself pointed out that the provisions of clause and clause require as a condition of all licences that all necessary information is recorded <e> <s> in addition under clause that information must be provided to the authority <e> <s> since the authority will already <e>", "<cs> i am aware of the statistics quoted by my noble friend the duke of norfolk which he has so kindly placed in the library but i should like to make absolutely clear that this amendment does not make private prosecutions impossible as my noble friend suggested <e> <s> it simply requires the consent of the dpp before such a private prosecution can be brought <e>", "<cs> i do not feel it is necessary at this stage to withdraw the amendment but i will inform the noble lord lord kennet of the additional cases which i am not able to do spontaneously at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter is probably readily available and i see no reason why it should not be placed in the library for the convenience of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have thought that that was most unlikely <e> <s> if the terms of their suspension are that they are not paid during that period obviously backdating covers only the period <e>", "<cs> i understood that the tenor of the offer made by the noble lord lord ennals and the other peers involved was that they would <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have that point clarified <e> <s> if the noble lord had felt that it would be of any value i had been about to say that i would be happy to see him and the other peers who had volunteered to discuss the matter if he wished <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that the british public are probably influenced by some of the rather inaccurate statements made in the british press <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am happy to acknowledge that and also happy to return again to the salaried structure argument which was intended to set this on a sensible basis and which indeed was acknowledged by the government so to do <e> <s> that salaried structure was a good deal for ambulance staff <e> <s> we should not be misled into believing that the basis of the deal has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that because i do not know the detailed figures <e> <s> i shall certainly look into that matter <e> <s> i believe it was suggested by the noble lord lord monkswell that there was a hidden agenda in the way the service is delivered <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> i believe that it is often forgotten that in april we published a scrutiny report on a non-emergency sector of the ambulance service in which we said that it was open to district health authorities to buy in part of the ambulance service from the private sector if that was more cost-effective and provided that the quality of service was maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i made it quite clear at the outset that nothing new had arisen on either side so far as i was aware <e> <s> therefore it would be very difficult for me to use new arguments in responding to old questions <e> <s> i turn to a point which the noble lord lord rochester raised about a meeting of chief ambulance officers which took place yesterday with the national health service chief executive duncan nichol <e> <s> the chief ambulance officers agreed with him that a pay formula was inconsistent with local pay flexibility and the right to manage <e> <s> they also agreed that a two-year deal was likely to play a part in settling the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made our position perfectly clear on the question of how we view a possible pay formula <e> <s> it is a subject which will always be considered <e> <s> it forms no part of the proposals and the arrangements we are making in relation to the current dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that this is a problem that goes wider than that applicable to central london <e> <s> as i said in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this aspect of the matter <e> <s> we very much recognise the work of the voluntary organisations in this field <e> <s> as regards the homeless mentally ill initiative affecting psychiatric patients the government have had a number of discussions with voluntary organisations and others with direct experience of helping the homeless in london <e> <s> these organisations include st mungo housing bondway housing association thames reach and the psychiatric team for single homeless people at guys hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning funding the government certainly do not regard community care as a cheap and easy option <e> <s> nevertheless we take the view that much can be done within existing resources given local commitment and collaboration which we believe to be there <e> <s> however gross spending on hospital and community health services for mental illness grew by per cent <e> <s> in real terms between and to million <e> <s> that is the most recent figure available <e> <s> estimated gross expenditure on local authority services for mentally ill people rose in the same period by per cent <e> <s> in real terms to million <e> <s> i feel sure that the noble lord will agree that money is not the only consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are by no means intending to impose a clampdown on local authorities <e> <s> they are intending that local authorities should react responsibly to their local responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been concern in recent years about how to make effective arrangements for the continuing care of mentally ill people being treated in the community <e> <s> in this context we believe that the voluntary organisations have a very important role to play <e> <s> the department has already issued national health service planning guidelines <e> <s> shortly detailed guidelines will be issued to ensure that by st april all district health authorities are required to initiate in collaboration with local social service departments explicit individually tailored care programmes for all such people <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the outset we are aware of the general concern <e> <s> all interested parties who can make a contribution will be consulted <e> <s> i should like to re-emphasise that the care programme approach reinforced by the new specific mental illness grant to local authorities payable from st april should have a significant impact on the provision of adequate locally based services <e>", "<cs> my lords the research and evaluation funded by the department of health has shown that most commonly homeless mentally ill people the group to which the question is directed have had care organised outside hospital but have subsequently lost touch with services <e> <s> in the future we are working to direct our efforts to ensure that the numbers losing touch in this way will fall as a result of the care programme approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing that point to my attention <e> <s> i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to obtain reliable figures on the position across the country in regard to how people are being dealt with <e> <s> as i said previously in many cases homeless mentally ill people have had care organised outside hospital but have lost touch subsequently with the services <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords in determining the resources that will be made available account will certainly be taken not only of income support that would have been payable under the present scheme to people in private residential care and nursing homes but also of demographic trends and the rate at which local authorities will assume responsibility for the care of new clients <e> <s> certainly the system will allow for assessment of needs as and when they arise whether that is at the initial stage or in the course of a period of residential care <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in order to reassure the noble lord i can tell him that it is intended there shall be a special weighting factor for those aged over <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is a separate question <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the government recognise that adequate resources will be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that an uneven playing field exists under the present system and that encourages a healthy mixture of statutory residential accommodation provided by local authorities and residential care and nursing accommodation provided by the private and voluntary sectors <e> <s> the provision in the white paper seeks to promote this mixed economy of care <e> <s> it is intended that the demographic trends be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before i believe that the reference to the community tax is a separate question <e> <s> my understanding is that the community tax will only produce one-quarter of the local authorities spending revenue <e> <s> the revenue support grant will be assessed in the usual way and will make a substantial contribution particularly in the area of community care <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy continues to rest on the principle that it is the duty of local authorities to provide residential care <e> <s> under the new proposals there will be stricter arrangements for assessing needs for residential care as opposed to the possibility of elderly people remaining in the community with appropriate back-up services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i gave the noble lord that assurance last week <e> <s> what i seem to recollect saying is that we believe that local authorities have a duty to deal responsibly with their local needs <e> <s> that does not mean that they should be expected to raise revenues through the community charge <e> <s> that charge and the resources <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the arrangements at present in place will continue for this interim period and that the new assessment arrangements and care arrangements to be made will operate from april <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that point to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for raising this point <e> <s> i can confirm that we shall look at the argument that he has put forward in this respect and come back to it if necessary at a subsequent stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should start by reiterating what i said in committee that is that there will be no question of national health service patients being charged for the licence fees <e> <s> indeed there are no powers which would make that possible even if anybody wanted to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the most conclusive example and it is perfectly clear is that of the cost of medicines licensing which is paid for either by the national health service or the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going on to say that nevertheless in view of the support that has been shown and because i hope we are always a listening government prepared to be as co-operative as possible i should be happy to meet and discuss the matter before third reading as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is referring to the national health service trusts <e> <s> i should tell him that i shall be dealing with them shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason we are not in any way privatising by introducing the concept of national health service trusts is that those units of the health service which apply for that status will do so on the basis that they continue to receive their funding from government <e> <s> the flexibility which will allow them to have a certain number of private beds in no way suggests that it will be the end of the national health service provision for those units <e> <s> the government have already made much-needed changes in the structure of the national health service workforce <e> <s> perhaps i should point out at this stage that we shall shortly have plenty of opportunity to debate the governments national health service proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to tell the noble lord that i am not aware of the problem <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord is agreeable i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may repeat what i said during second reading <e> <s> the governments role in proceedings on the bill of the noble lord lord houghton is to provide an impartial assessment of the practical effects of the bill and to provide advice and whatever information may help the house to reach a decision <e> <s> as i also said at second reading like their predecessors this government are neutral on the ethical issues of abortion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and the noble lord for their support of this amendment <e> <s> i say to the noble baroness lady phillips that the offence would be discovered in the normal course of registration of the licence by the authorities as it seems to me <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that my intention was to clarify that in the course of the process of inspection this information would come to light <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord caldecote has explained he moved two amendments in relation to the inspection functions of the authority at committee stage <e> <s> the first of these was aimed at requiring the authority to visit annually premises which it licensed <e> <s> i am happy to confirm to my noble friend that the government will bring forward an amendment at third reading to deal with this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is perhaps seeking to make a comparison with the sight test charges <e> <s> we cannot make a direct comparison there because people do not have their eyes tested as frequently as they visit the dentists <e> <s> the evidence we have of the overall trend year on year is of a slight increase <e> <s> as i have said although we recognise there has been a slight dip we do not accept that it is a long-term trend <e>", "<cs> my lords we are confident that most people accept the general principle that it is right for those who can afford to do so to pay a small amount for the care of their teeth <e> <s> it must also be remembered in that context that for per cent <e> <s> of patients all national health service treatment is completely free for example for young people under students pregnant women and those receiving income support <e> <s> as i said we do not accept that a long-term trend has been established <e> <s> we believe that the proposals in the new dentists contract will also contribute to improving vastly the service that is being offered <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i quoted represented the two middle quarters of last year <e> <s> the figures quoted by my honourable friend which the noble lord has mentioned are those for the final quarter of last year <e> <s> the diminution from - to - million took place in the final quarter of last year <e> <s> the figures differ from those quoted by the noble baroness because our records show when dentists were paid for check-ups which is usually some time after the check-ups took place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord can be happy because he now has all the figures before him <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that the slight dip that has been indicated by our figures represents a dramatic decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords we are frequently in consultation with the representatives of the dentists and their various professional bodies <e> <s> that is particularly so in the case of the new contracts which are proposed for dentists and which we believe will introduce very important changes to the benefit of patients <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we are operating on the premise that the authority which is to be appointed will be a responsible body that will take account of the kind of anxieties expressed by your lordships <e> <s> our intention is and always has been not to impose a straitjacket on this highly responsible body <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that it would relate to one particular year <e> <s> after all licences will be issued for a certain number of years <e> <s> i would expect that the extent if any of the discretion to be used by the authority would be covered in the authoritys annual report to which <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have increased the budget for this special health authority considerably in line with the increases for other special health authorities <e> <s> the department is currently considering future funding arrangements for such authorities which will seek to safeguard their special interests particularly in the light of the governments proposals for the reform of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking plenty of initiatives in the field of health care <e> <s> the measures which are currently being proposed in the maudsley hospital reflect the changing pattern of need for mentally handicapped children and seriously disturbed adolescents <e> <s> the shift in emphasis is to outreach facilities from hospital care <e> <s> however we believe that there is inbuilt in the budget and the allocation made to this special health authority the possibility for further savings within the authoritys activities <e>", "<cs> my lords the emergency clinic which provides a -hour walk-in service for people with psychiatric problems and a drop-in service for former in-patients is a highly rated service not only by patients who use its facilities but also by local general practitioners social workers and voluntary organisations <e> <s> in recognition of that and in addition <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that the maudsley represents a centre of excellence <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a formal procedure which health authorities are required to follow when considering the closure or change of use of health buildings <e> <s> the proposal to close the cassel hospital is currently out for consultation <e> <s> as the matter may ultimately come before ministers for decision it is not one on which i can comment <e> <s> however i can assure the noble baroness that should the closure proposal come to ministers it will receive the most careful consideration before any decision is taken in view of the important work that we recognise is carried on there <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we are moving away from the question on the order paper <e> <s> however in response to the noble earl i can say that any application of that kind receives the most careful consideration within the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the pleasure and privilege of visiting the maudsley hospital seeing the work that is carried out and meeting many of the people who work there <e> <s> i recognise that they would like to have more funds <e> <s> that is normal where people are intensely interested in the work they do <e> <s> we believe that they have been treated very fairly and that the rise in funding will be adequate to meet their needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that my honourable friend visited the maudsley this morning <e> <s> i had an opportunity to speak to her subsequently <e> <s> she felt that she had been able to reassure the people she met as to their future <e> <s> as i said previously in any event the department is considering future funding arrangements for special health authorities to safeguard their special interests particularly in the light of the new proposals for the reform of the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret having perhaps given a misleading impression <e> <s> i feel that it almost goes without saying that i shall certainly refer the remarks that have been made in this dicussion to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had listened with his usual attention to what i said he would have heard many instances when i referred to the allegations that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords as always it will be for individual authorities to consider how to make the most cost-effective use of the funds that are available to them in the light of local circumstances and overall legislative requirements <e> <s> we believe that that kind of approach is the one which is most likely to lead to the innovative local diverse and flexible service that we all seek in bringing in these changes <e> <s> if it is any reassurance to the noble lord i remind him that local authority pss spending has increased by per cent <e> <s> in real terms over the past years <e> <s> there is no reason to believe that that trend will be reversed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for those authorities that have been capped to determine their own spending priorities within their revised budgets in the light of legislative requirements and local needs <e> <s> however as i said before we see no reason to believe that the trend of increased funding for social services will be reversed <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason for the noble lord to spread alarm and despondency in that connection <e> <s> in the view of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment the proposed charge capping is reasonable and appropriate on the basis of the information available to him in all the circumstances of each authority concerned <e> <s> the charge capping should not involve any disruption to services <e> <s> however as regards future plans for community care it will be the duty of local authorities to consult in the preparation of their plans and to publish their community care plans <e> <s> if anything should go wrong the secretary of state has powers of direction to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always said that they fully recognise that local authorities will require adequate resources to discharge their new responsibilities <e> <s> resource requirements stemming from legislation and new burdens placed upon authorities will be taken into account in determining the level of central government financial support to be given <e> <s> while no definite estimates are available at this stage hundreds of millions of pounds have been referred to <e> <s> the amount that the government would otherw ise be providing to finance care through social security payments for people in residential and nursing homes for example will be transferred to local authorities on a pound for pound basis in the grant and personal social services standard spending assessments <e> <s> the sum involved and the total <e>", "<cs> my lords local accountability is central to the community charge system <e> <s> however it will of course take some time for accountability pressures to be fully effective <e> <s> regrettably a number of authorities have chosen to budget excessively for - hence the need for my right honourable friend to use the powers given to him by parliament to protect charge payers from the consequences of excessive spending <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no indication of the kind of consequences that the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> however the public expenditure survey is reviewed every year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may not be totally aware that the costing of the community care provisions that we hope will be implemented as a result of the bill which is currently before parliament will not be taken into account in this years local authority spending but will come up in next years public expenditure survey <e> <s> the amount that has been provided for this year is just for the preparatory work that is required <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear the experiences quoted by the noble lord lord winstanley and others <e> <s> i begin by agreeing completely with those who have said that party politics should not be the criterion in these important appointments <e>", "<cs> i believe that the implication of the amendment is that that information should be routinely collected <e> <s> that is what i am aiming to disprove with my argument <e> <s> certainly it is not routinely collected as of now <e> <s> one cannot of course prevent anybody who so chooses from writing with views on any subject <e>", "<cs> i understand the concerns expressed by the mover of the amendment <e> <s> therefore i am very pleased to be able to reassure the committee on the matter with which it is concerned <e> <s> i believe however that the amendment and i hope that i shall be able to explain this is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to reassure the noble baroness <e> <s> in the department when we are looking at names and nominations we are always anxious to ensure that there is a very good mix in every sense of the word <e> <s> i certainly anticipate that in making appointments to the new bodies those who are making the appointments whether from the centre or at regional health authority level will be guided by the principle that they shall have the best possible mix of background and experience <e> <s> and that includes a fair representation of women <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for emphasising this point because it is important to reassure people and to allay any anxieties which may have arisen as a result of the introduction of these proposals <e> <s> i should like to reaffirm that it is not intended that gps as a group should be excluded from regional health authorities or district health authorities <e> <s> we shall bear that very much in mind when issuing guidance <e> <s> i should also point out that no appointments will be made in this respect until after the bill receives royal assent <e> <s> as to the point raised by the noble baroness lady phillips to which my noble friend lord jenkin to some extent replied it is in the nature of things that fresh blood must be introduced from time to time <e> <s> that is recognised even in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the investigatory nature of his intervention <e> <s> i shall do my best to give him an adequate answer <e> <s> if it is not adequate i shall be happy to supplement it further at later stages <e>", "<cs> these amendments are indeed important <e> <s> we have heard the views of some very important people in the course of our discussion this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i hoped that i had made it clear that i consider universities to be a special case <e>", "<cs> we are all agreed about the aim of the amendments to ensure effective collaboration between the universities and the national health service <e> <s> i have tried to explain the reason why the government have approached the matter as set out in the bill and why we believe it to be unnecessary to introduce such provisions <e> <s> nevertheless having listened to the powerful arguments i shall do my best to meet as many as possible <e> <s> it may be that there are more ways than one of dealing with the situation <e> <s> i shall do my best to come back with an effective solution <e>", "<cs> we have had a wide-ranging discussion on the issue of representation <e> <s> the government recognise that there is an important professional contribution to be made to decision making <e> <s> we believe that we provided for that in the most effective way <e> <s> i do not think that any of the solutions proposed in the amendments now before the committee add to our proposals indeed they might well work against them to the detriment of good management which at the end of the day is what will benefit patients most <e> <s> that is what we all want <e>", "<cs> yes i understand <e> <s> however i believe that the effect of the process which is suggested by these amendments would be that the individual would feel that he was representing the interests which had appointed him <e>", "<cs> the person concerned will have been appointed for his personal contribution <e> <s> that is exactly what can happen in this case <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to prevent any professional individual being appointed to make that sort of contribution if he is his personal capacity is seen to be the suitable person for that appointment <e>", "<cs> i am so glad that the noble baroness agrees with me <e>", "<cs> if no other noble lord wishes to comment perhaps i may respond by saying that the move away from representative appointments does not mean that health authorities and fhsas will not have their finger on the pulse of their local communities far from it <e> <s> non-executive members will usually have some connection with the local community either through residence or employment or because they are active in local voluntary or community organisations <e> <s> so we believe that they will be very sensitive to the local community needs <e> <s> indeed as we have already established they could include a local councillor appointed on an individual personal basis <e>", "<cs> nowhere in the bill do we say that we shall not or should not have a doctor as a non-executive member <e> <s> i believe that in many cases we shall have medical practitioners on the authorities <e> <s> i share the noble lords concern that all authorities should have access to the best professional advice <e> <s> we have already discussed this in some detail on a previous amendment but i must repeat that i believe that specifying details of membership in primary legislation is not necessarily the best way of guaranteeing the availability of professional advice to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> the current position is that there is no statutory requirement on this matter although i understand that in practice all health authorities contain a medical practitioner representative at present <e> <s> i have no doubt that most health authorities if not all will continue that practice in the future <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent that process continuing <e>", "<cs> we accepted the acheson report <e> <s> we have acted upon it by appointing directors of public health <e> <s> one of the duties of the director of public health is to prepare an annual report which will be very important to the deliberations of the health authority <e> <s> we expect that most regional and district health authorities will appoint the director of public health as one of their executive members in the light of the recommendations of the acheson report concerning the public health function <e> <s> however we do not believe that seeking to prescribe that the director of public health should automatically be a member as is suggested by the amendments would in itself make medical advice any more effective <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> that is a good example of the right appointment being made on a personal basis <e>", "<cs> yes and i expect that they will be fulfilled but without the kind of prescriptive arrangement proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have tried to establish over previous amendments that we do not wish to be too prescriptive about appointments <e> <s> i intend to be entirely consistent in relation to the amendment <e>", "<cs> all authorities will continue to attach great importance to the views and needs of disabled people who are after all a significant client group for the national health service <e> <s> however we do not believe that the interests of disabled people are best served by statutory representation on the membership of an authority <e> <s> as i have emphasised we shall welcome applications and recommendations for membership from many quarters <e> <s> of course there is nothing in our proposals to prevent the appointment of disabled people or those with a particular knowledge of a disability <e> <s> in saying that i recognise the wording of the amendment to which the noble lord lord ennals particularly drew our attention <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the noble lord lord pitt that we have strong and very effective representation from the disabled members of this chamber <e> <s> i equally underline the fact that there is no statutory requirement to have disabled members of the committee <e> <s> that will apply equally to representation on health authorities <e>", "<cs> briefly since we have already discussed this amendment i repeat that the people making appointments will naturally wish to seek nominations from and consult with the widest possible range of organisations to identify the most able candidates <e> <s> however in referring to specific bodies the amendment excludes other sources of professional nominations and other bodies which could perhaps provide useful advice about appointments <e> <s> i reiterate that we do not believe statutory consultation is necessary <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be that all special health authorities not just those for the london postgraduate teaching hospitals would be required to have a postgraduate institute member <e> <s> clearly that would not be appropriate <e> <s> however i appreciate the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> i hope that i can reassure the noble lords lord dainton and lord hunter and my noble friend lord bridgeman on that point <e>", "<cs> yes that is a correct interpretation of what i said <e>", "<cs> no i do not think so <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> we are required under section of the national health service act to have a constitution order and as i understand it it will be implemented through the negative procedures of parliament so it will therefore come before parliament <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord rea said the government have accepted that it is sensible to work towards a target of an average week of duty of hours for all junior hospital doctors <e> <s> however it would be irresponsible to agree to a maximum hour week for any grade of junior doctors without a clear and agreed view from all the parties as to how that could be achieved <e>", "<cs> i too am grateful to the noble lord lord dainton for the thorough way in which he introduced his amendment on this important topic <e> <s> like him i am sorry that my right honourable friends appearance before the select committee tomorrow does not pre-date this debate <e> <s> however i hope that what i am able to say today will advance matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should attempt to respond briefly to some of the additional points that have been raised <e> <s> i should like to confirm particularly to my noble friend lord carr that there is no question but that this appointment will be a full-time appointment <e> <s> the duties other than those relating to the national health service which we envisage will in fact form the major part of the new directors duties relate to policy development work which feeds into the national health service <e>", "<cs> it may assist members of the committee if at this stage i explain how the government see the implementation of the reforms <e> <s> i shall later attempt to respond to specific points raised in the course of what promises to be an important debate <e>", "<cs> i am aware of only a few ballots on the subject <e>", "<cs> we have worked closely with the health authorities and managers <e> <s> in turn they have involved their clinicians and other health professionals <e> <s> there are many individual members of the profession and no doubt we shall hear from some of them during our debate this afternoon who believe that our proposals are the way forward <e> <s> we believe that we need to continue working with those people taking their advice and learning with them <e> <s> it is no part of our strategy to second-guess them by imposing our means over theirs <e>", "<cs> i stressed earlier that our plans were largely based upon taking account of the working experience of the first waves of volunteers <e> <s> i cannot sufficiently emphasise that fact <e> <s> i do not believe that it is the intention of the proposers of the amendment to constrain enthusiasts within the national health service but i greatly fear that that would be the effect of the proposals in the amendment <e> <s> they may indeed have recognised this themselves by removing the earlier reference and my noble friend lady cox pointed out that they did to two regions and a three-year timespan but i believe that the danger remains <e>", "<cs> the experience for the initial contracting arrangements will of necessity have to be based upon current referral patterns and arrangements <e> <s> it will be on that basis that the initial years contracts will be entered into in those areas where there is no more sophisticated arrangement already in place <e> <s> in some areas because there has been a certain amount of experience the resource management inititative is in being and there is already a basis of experience on which to build <e>", "<cs> i believe that i responded to that point however i apologise if i did not do so adequately <e> <s> yes i think that the observation consideration and evaluation of the first wave of candidates will be substantial <e>", "<cs> the issues under discussion in this large grouping of amendments are relevant to my right honourable friend the secretary of states discussion with the royal colleges and other bodies on the possibility of establishing a statutory multiprofessional advisory group on the standards of clinical care for national health service patients <e> <s> in this we recognise the historical role of the royal colleges in maintaining standards to which the noble lord lord butterfield referred <e> <s> i hope the committee will understand that in responding to the debate i would not want to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions in any way <e>", "<cs> i was interested to note the remarks made by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and i shall read carefully what he has said <e> <s> the same general response that i have given in relation to all the amendments applies here <e>", "<cs> the government have made clear their intention that all hospital and community health services should be funded through contracts from april <e> <s> this timetable was discussed with national health service managers who considered it to be feasible <e> <s> the government are therefore confident that management capacity in the nhs is equal to the task <e> <s> we believe that it is important that the benefits of contracting are seen as soon as possible throughout the service so that we can begin this evolutionary system of developing the service and making it more sophisticated <e>", "<cs> the government fully accept and my right honourable friend the secretary of state has been at pains to underline their duty to provide a healthy atmosphere for medical research and the education and training of all its staff <e> <s> discussion of training tends to centre on doctors and dentists but our commitment to high quality training for nurses and other professions should not be doubted either <e> <s> for example we are providing substantial new funding for the ambitious project programme <e>", "<cs> the bills proposals are designed to assist gps and other health care professionals to obtain the best available services for their patients <e> <s> we believe that contracts will be particularly helpful in this respect because they will allow resources to move more freely to the hospitals that are most popular with gps and their patients and will give all providers an incentive to improve <e> <s> they specify the standards of care that can be expected <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should start by confirming that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> e f a b and ba <e> <s> does the noble lord lord dainton wish to speak <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the arguments on these amendments about the <e>", "<cs> we have previously touched on the important subject of the relationship between national health service trusts and universities <e> <s> it will be as important for nhs trusts as for the rest of the nhs to develop effective and close working relationships with universtities <e> <s> the government are most concerned to build on these links at all levels in the nhs <e> <s> that was made quite clear in the letter sent in february to all nhs managers by the permanent secretary at the department of health <e> <s> the permanent secretarys steering group on undergraduate medical and dental education is continuing to work on the issue <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i am not sure that i follow the question of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that that is the case <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and to the noble lord lord butterfield <e> <s> i am sorry if i appeared obtuse <e> <s> it seemed to me that i had responded to the question raised by the noble lord lord walton in my reply when i said that the relevant section of the national health service act would remain in force <e> <s> that is a duty which bites or the secretary of state <e> <s> however it is <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify that that is the case <e>", "<cs> we believe that the amendments proposed would compromise trusts freedom to manage their own affairs and to determine the terms and conditions of service for all their employees which we believe to be an important not to say fundamental part of the greater freedom that we are giving to trusts <e>", "<cs> i must have misheard the noble lord previously <e> <s> i was about to reassure him of what he already knows that national health service trusts can hold money on trust <e>", "<cs> i agree that the term national health service trust does not mean trust in the legally defined sense <e> <s> nevertheless when i say that national health service trusts can hold money on trust it would obviously involve setting up a special trust fund <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> they are empowered to do so by clauses and of the bill <e> <s> i hope that we are all relatively clear on that point <e>", "<cs> at the outset i made it quite clear that national health service trusts will be competing with other national health service units in gaining contracts <e> <s> if they price themselves out of the market they will not obtain the contracts necessary for their wellbeing <e>", "<cs> we believe that given the increased freedom and ability to manage their own resource they will become more efficient and be in a better position to compete <e>", "<cs> the problem here lies not with the powers or duties of the fpcs or fhsas as they will become which remain unchanged in this respect but with reaching the homeless in the first place and encouraging them to come forward to receive the health services that they need <e>", "<cs> i shall try to answer my noble friends question as best i can <e> <s> anyone normally resident in the united kingdom including homeless people is entitled to register with a gp for general medical services under the national health system <e> <s> that includes people who have come to the united kingdom to take up permanent residence besides those who have been resident here for months prior to needing treatment <e> <s> normally a person wishing to find out where he should register would approach the family practitioner committee or the fhsa as it will become known <e> <s> if a person is unaware of what a fhsa is or where to find it he can go through the normal information channels including for example the citizens advice bureaux <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord that if he has difficulty in interpreting the act he might turn to the noble lord lord ennals on his left who would no doubt be able to point him in the right direction <e> <s> having said that i confirm that the noble lord gave an accurate summary of the position <e> <s> anyone resident or normally resident in the united kingdom is entitled to register with a gp or with general medical services under the national health service <e> <s> i can assure him that the fhsa is to have exactly the same power as the existing fpcs <e> <s> the point of reference is in the general medical and pharmaceutical regulations which are not affected by the bill <e> <s> therefore the point does not require repetition in the bill <e>", "<cs> i emphasise that the government are aiming to tackle the whole problem of the homeless in the round as it were and are considering what initiatives are necessary and appropriate in that respect <e> <s> it is a difficult problem and this aspect of the problem is especially difficult <e> <s> i firmly believe that it will not be solved simply by writing an amendment of this kind into the bill <e> <s> it will be solved only if we can set up methods of approach to the homeless and methods of follow up to take the point referred to by the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> the arrangements we have made funded pilot projects the outreach projects and the circulation of best practice on this difficult subject are the right approach <e>", "<cs> outreach facilities are in many cases sponsored by government <e> <s> it is the whole concept of having facilities closer to the community which they aim to serve <e>", "<cs> in case the noble lord wishes to move on rather rapidly to another topic i feel i should intervene at this point <e> <s> it is important that i repeat what i said earlier and perhaps i should do so rather more strongly <e> <s> this is not a consolidating bill <e> <s> the provision which the noble lord seeks to introduce is already covered by section of the national health service act and the regulations i previously mentioned namely the general medical and pharmaceutical regulations and others which were made under that legislation <e> <s> i believe that that provides all the reassurance sought by the noble lord and others <e> <s> the bill in no way affects those rights and duties <e>", "<cs> i do not have a copy of the act with me and cannot quote section for the committee <e> <s> however i gather that the noble lord lord peston has one and perhaps he would be able to help the committee <e> <s> i repeat that this section of the act is still there it is not repealed by the bill <e> <s> this is not a consolidating bill and i do not believe <e>", "<cs> i should say with regard to the whole group of amendments that there is not much difference between us regarding the intentions behind the amendments <e> <s> the aims of the amendments are clearly in general to improve information and access for patients <e> <s> however as might be expected we differ in the matter of achieving those aims <e>", "<cs> we would have no objection to a particular fhsa building on the centralised information to meet the requirements of its area <e> <s> in connection with the national scheme we have already published an attractive leaflet explaining the scheme thoroughly to the public <e> <s> so far as i am aware it is being made widely available through fpcs and community health centres <e> <s> therefore they are obviously relying on that leaflet to some extent <e> <s> however if there is additional information which they wish to furnish for their local populations we would have no objection <e>", "<cs> under our <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for assisting the committee and to the noble lord lord walton for reiterating what i said namely that the number of women medical school students is now up to the per cent <e> <s> mark <e> <s> it is important to translate that figure into general practice <e> <s> again i must turn to the new gp contract because it will be extremely beneficial to women in practice <e> <s> for the first time it will recognise both part-time and job-sharing gps and allow them to be unrestricted principals <e> <s> that will be of special benefit to doctors with domestic responsibilities such as women with <e>", "<cs> the enhanced management role of fpcs for the family practitioner services in their area will be taken a step further under <e>", "<cs> as the committee may be aware as part of the new contracts and terms of service gps are required to maintain their surgeries at a certain standard in order to receive rent and rate reimbursement <e> <s> we have tightened up the standards from st april in the new contract to include a requirement for satisfactory access to gp premises for disabled persons and for toilets to be available with wheelchair access <e> <s> i hope that this is welcome i feel sure that it will be in view of the remarks that have been made <e> <s> in addition as part of their increased management role for family health servicer fhsas will already have management information about the facilities available for disabled people in gp surgeries in their areas <e> <s> i have already referred to the local directories of family doctors which the fpcs are now required to publish <e> <s> gps could obviously include additional information about the services they provide for disabled people if they wish <e>", "<cs> practices vary enormously in the numbers and types of patients that they treat <e> <s> for that reason raw management information of that type is useful for fpcs as a base line for planning <e> <s> however i suggest that it is not much use to the general public <e> <s> requiring fhsas to publish it would not enable patients to make any meaningful comparisons <e> <s> such bald statistics may mislead patients because they conceal the true situation <e> <s> for example a low rate may be due to the presence of <e>", "<cs> i believe that that would be most helpful to patients <e> <s> i fully anticipate that that is exactly the information that we shall be seeing in the practice leaflets <e>", "<cs> first the local directories of family doctors to which i referred will contain information about whether doctors provide contraceptive services <e> <s> this could include if the doctors wished details of whether they possess a certificate of family planning awarded by the joint committee on contraception <e>", "<cs> it may help the committee if i start by saying that in promoting better health fpcs have been given an enhanced role in the management of family practioner services which includes assessing health needs developing services to meet those needs and targeting cash limited funds for practice team development <e> <s> that will be taken further under <e>", "<cs> before i respond to the substance of the amendment i take the opportunity to state clearly that we do not accept that the changes which we are introducing will make patients more or less financially attractive to gps <e> <s> that applies <e>", "<cs> we believe that family health services authorities should ensure that their residents know of their existence and how they can help them <e> <s> indeed this duty is already included in the enhanced management role we have given to fpcs <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals is correct in that it will be a larger role <e> <s> it will place a strong emphasis on patients as consumers of health services and on responsiveness to local needs <e>", "<cs> i reiterate that the basic information which is important and desirable is already available to the individual on the medical card which is issued to him <e> <s> i agree with the newly enhanced role of the fhsas which will involve assessing health needs developing services to meet those needs and targeting cash limited funds for practice team development and so on <e> <s> those measures will go a long way to making people much more aware of the role of the fhsa than has been the case in the past as regards the slightly more limited role of the fpcs <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to those who have contributed to this discussion <e> <s> perhaps i may start in the general way in which the noble lord lord ennals opened his speech <e> <s> i should like to reiterate what i said at an earlier stage <e> <s> the whole idea of the gp-funding initiative is that the scheme is voluntary no one will be obliged to join it <e> <s> the practices with list sizes of around patients will be eligible and those with between to patients will be considered on an individual basis <e> <s> smaller practices can group together to apply <e>", "<cs> that is correct as i stated previously <e> <s> perhaps i may reiterate some of the benefits and advantages of the proposal for the practice budget <e> <s> one of the new advantages is that for the first time gps will be able to back their choice of hospital and consultant with money to pay for treatment including those in the private sector <e> <s> gps will also be able to spend any savings on their budgets for the benefit of their patients <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take the opportunity to clarify the matter <e> <s> i said that the management allowance was intended to be <e> <s> that is obviously not now available for the reasons that we have discussed <e> <s> however amounts up to are available now which can help practices with their preparatory work <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by saying yes this is a voluntary scheme and any doctor or practice which becomes involved in it has the right to withdraw from it if it should so wish <e> <s> the relevant provisions are contained in clause <e>", "<cs> i must reiterate that i know over who are <e>", "<cs> the level of the practice fund will depend on the composition of the lists and there will be strong safeguards to ensure that all patients continue to receive the treatment that they need <e> <s> that is an assurance that i have already given <e> <s> the safeguards will include powers to increase the level of the practice fund where necessary <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals admits i also made it clear that the government have moved on from their approach taken in the white paper to the clawing back of under-spends <e>", "<cs> an important aim of our proposals is precisely to avoid the sort of crisis management which exists at present in the national health service and to ensure that the relevant bodies plan and budget appropriately <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope that we shall be in a position well before february next year to publish the results of the negotiations which are now being carried on <e> <s> the universities requirements for capital funding in order to refurbish accommodation and to purchase equipment are central to the discussions <e> <s> we are exploring exactly what these costs will be and how best they may be met <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the remarks that have been made in the course of this question <e> <s> officials are in close and regular contact with the british orthoptic society the relevant universities and the college of ophthalmologists <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can best quote the white paper <e> <s> it states that from the date when the new arrangements take effect the department will top slice centrally for the cost of orthoptists training although it will look to the regions within which the centres are situated to manage the training and contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> orthoptists form one of the professions allied to medicine <e> <s> they have traditionally been concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of muscular conditions of the eyes in particular squints but their role has widened and expanded over the years <e> <s> their main clients are children <e> <s> increasingly they undertake vision screening for young children and also work among the elderly including stroke and glaucoma victims <e> <s> they work closely with ophthalmologists and increasingly act as the first point of referral for patients from a variety of sources <e>", "<cs> my lords it means withholding allocations which would otherwise be made direct to the regions for the purpose of a particular need <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any particular pressure to increase the number of orthoptists <e> <s> i understand that there are about orthoptists undergoing training at any given time and that there are some working orthoptists <e> <s> i am not aware of any great demand to increase numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the negotiations taking place are intended to cover everything including detailed arrangements for the closure of schools <e> <s> our intention is that intakes of new students to existing training schools will cease from the autumn of by which time we expect to have the new arrangements in place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is far too early to draw such conclusions from the surveys that have been carried out <e> <s> the market has obviously not settled since the april changes <e> <s> in fact we estimate that since and before about - million more sight tests were carried out over and above normal expectations <e> <s> extensive publicity about charges undoubtedly encouraged many people to bring forward their appointments to avoid the april deadline <e> <s> as people generally only have their sight tested once every couple of years it will take time for a true picture to emerge <e> <s> notwithstanding that one-third of the population is still entitled to free sight testing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the recently published survey by the liberal democrats <e> <s> it covered a relatively small number of people <e> <s> on the other hand the government survey to which i referred is an independent market research arrangement which will cover a random sample of about adults to ascertain whether they have had a sight test since christmas and if so whether it was done through the national health service or privately <e> <s> we believe that it would be better to await the outcome of that survey before drawing any conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems unlikely that a charge of between and once every two years or even following an accident as the noble baroness suggested should deter too many people <e> <s> there is certainly no evidence to suggest that serious eye diseases are going undetected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving the house more details of that survey but i am glad that he agrees it is too early to draw final conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no intention of denigrating i do not think that i said anything which did so <e> <s> i simply recommended that your lordships have a little patience and await the outcome of the current government survey <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there is absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that we believe that this continues to be an unsettled period and that any effects are temporary <e> <s> we realise that there may not be total awareness among those entitled to a free service <e> <s> a publicity campaign intended to bring attention to entitlement to free nhs sight tests is to be launched later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that we have for the earlier period relate to those obtaining a free service under the national health service <e> <s> as i have said that applies to about a third of the population <e> <s> there is no change in the uptake of eye tests in that proportion of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard many and varied views on the westminster and chelsea project <e> <s> i am grateful to all who have contributed and i welcome the opportunity to explain the background to the project <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to indicate the varied points that have been raised <e> <s> i appreciate the problems of dual briefing experienced by noble lords opposite but they coped well with the problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i promise not to come back to it a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to deal with the point of the discrepancy in the quoted figures <e> <s> the departmental press release referred to the figure of million but that referred to a standardised cost figure which did not include the local factors and the local constructive costs to which i referred <e> <s> the regional health authoritys press release which quoted the figure of million included that additional load factor or weighting <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but also to provide a better service for the people in the area <e> <s> we have covered that difference between the initial cost of the hospital alone and the revised figure of million <e> <s> the increase in cost whichever basic figure one takes is simply due to the movement in building costs in the london area over the past months <e> <s> it also takes account of the expected movement during the period to the completion of the project <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that it is part of the phasing out in view of the replacement of the facilities in the new project <e>", "<cs> my lord in the event of a major incident there are a number of designated hospitals within reasonable distance of the city of westminster <e> <s> these include charing cross st marys hammersmith st thomass guys and university college/middlesex hospitals <e> <s> those are all hospitals that have sufficiently large accident and emergency departments to cope with such incidents and are able to provide mobile teams and a site medical officer if necessary <e> <s> for what are commonly termed the walking wounded in westminster and i hope that there are not too many from this palace there will be new and up-to-date facilities available at the local primary health centre to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spent the last minutes giving very good reasons why i am confident and why i have faith and i am sorry if the noble baroness was not totally convinced <e>", "<cs> this is an important matter <e> <s> we are concerned about nurse education and training and we are certainly not losing sight of the need to make progress <e> <s> as part of our commitment to review non-departmental public bodies the four united kingdom health departments commissioned an independent review of the united kingdom central council and the four national boards for nursing midwifery and health visiting which were established under the nurses midwives and health visitors act <e>", "<cs> i understand and sympathise with the objective underlying this proposed amendment <e> <s> i realise that its intention is to guarantee the continued provision of high quality health care <e> <s> we entirely share the concern but we do not believe that the situation can be dealt with by statute <e>", "<cs> we are committed to providing the best possible arrangements for mentally ill people who while no longer needing in-patient treatment nevertheless require medication to remain well while living in the community <e> <s> i fully recognise the points made by my noble friend in that respect <e> <s> despite all our efforts on occasion mentally ill people refuse treatment after leaving hospital even if that is considered essential by the treatment team responsible for their care <e>", "<cs> if it was felt that that particular area had sufficient priority then government time would be found in order to pass the necessary measure in the usual way <e>", "<cs> considerable progress is being made in this area as the noble lord has recognised <e> <s> i do not dispute the fact that there is always room for improvement <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment is misconceived in the sense that it envisages that long-term hospital beds for the mentally ill can be entirely phased out and replaced by community care services <e> <s> when better forms of treatment become available that may of course be possible <e> <s> however at present many people regard long-stay hospital beds as an essential element of locally based psychiatric services for example as a means of providing asylum care <e> <s> i recollect that in our debates about the homeless we were accused of turning out people from long-stay institutions and were urged to maintain them within the institutions <e>", "<cs> much of the discussion about financial implications which took place in connection with the last amendment applies also to these amendments <e> <s> however asking the government for an unlimited commitment is a very different kettle of fish in terms of the substance of the amendment <e> <s> in the whole area of community care our policy is designed to put the clear lead responsibility with local authorities building on the vital lead role that they have had for social care provision over the past years <e>", "<cs> this is an important area <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord lord carter that the government understand the problem <e> <s> i appreciate the desire of my noble friend lord mancroft for greater clarity <e> <s> i also recognise that this is an area of concern not only to members of the committee but also to the providers of facilities many of whom are in the voluntary or private sector <e>", "<cs> the intention is that for everyone everywhere there will be an authority which is responsible for them <e> <s> it will be up to the <e>", "<cs> i cannot imagine what was contained in my previous remarks to suggest to the noble lord lord pitt that there was any complacency about the situation <e> <s> we regard it as extremely serious <e> <s> the intention is that crisis intervention should not only be as good as it is now but that we should be able to improve upon what now exists <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> has two parts to it <e> <s> the first is about the notification of the outcome of an assessment to the person who has been assessed and we shall be coming on to discuss those issues also when we reach clause <e> <s> the other part of the amendment seeks that both the local authority and the district health authority should agree that arrangements are necessary before they are made to place someone in residential accommodation where nursing care is provided <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to comply with my noble friends request <e> <s> i shall endeavour to make it a short letter <e> <s> i shall make it available to other members of the committee who may be interested <e>", "<cs> i believe i said at the beginning of my lengthy oration that there are provisions in the bill which mean that a person cannot enter a nursing home for which a local authority will have to pay without that authority being both closely involved and consenting to the move <e> <s> that is an answer that i can clearly give at this stage <e> <s> perhaps i may read the record and include any other answers to questions raised by the noble lord in my reply to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i may not have given it sufficient thought <e> <s> i should like to do so before responding to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as is generally recognised the thrust of the governments community care proposals is to give the individual in need of care or support the highest possible quality of life <e> <s> this means providing the services and support which people who are affected by problems of ageing mental illness physical handicap and other disabilities need to be able to live as independently as possible in their own homes or in homely settings in the community <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i believe my conclusion was that we do not feel that the inclusion of this in primary legislation is the way forward <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to say at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i said nothing about posts being lost in the process <e> <s> i simply mentioned a corresponding loss which we expect to represent existing vacancies and natural wastage <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord that as part of the good news about st thomass hospital he should not overlook the splendid new south wing development due to be formally opened in july <e> <s> it cost over million <e> <s> the fine new accommodation for the dreadnought seafarers hospital opened in september and the baroness lane-fox unit opened at the end of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble and learned friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i also wish to draw to the attention of the house the importance of the national health service reforms that we are introducing <e> <s> they will very much help the situation which has been referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the noble lord lord ennals has considerable experience with the predecessor of the west lambeth health authority <e> <s> he had to threaten it with the use of default powers in order to encourage it to restrain its overspending <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for having drawn my attention to the dustbin or suspense account <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains the aim of the west lambeth health authority that the activity levels should be maintained through <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the measures were agreed only after lengthy consultations with medical and nursing staff <e> <s> it was on the understanding that they would have the least possible effect on patient services <e> <s> one advantage is that services should not be subject to the sudden curtailments of recent years when last minute efforts were made to stay within cash limits <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that that is so <e> <s> however i know that there is a history of overspending by this authority <e> <s> i emphasise that with the white paper and national health service and community care bill proposals under which the money will follow the patient a hospital such as st thomass which has expertise in so many clinical fields a central location and an internationally recognised name is bound to benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure which aspect of my noble friends question the noble lord refers to <e> <s> when the regional health authority discovered the extent of the current overspending it commissioned a report namely the john barnes report <e> <s> that report was published towards the middle of april and it concentrates not only on the underlying problem but on finding solutions to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord to a previous secretary of state for health or for the dhss as it was in those days who had similar problems with this authority <e> <s> everybody must operate within some cash limit and we aim to achieve the most efficient use of available funding and to ensure that patients certainly do not suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the rawp formula was originally introduced in <e> <s> the john barnes report to which i referred earlier identified a disorganised and hoping-for-the-best type business culture in the authority as one of the chief sources of its financial problems <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join all those who have expressed their gratitude to the noble earl lord baldwin for introducing the debate <e> <s> we have had a wide-ranging and stimulating discussion on a matter which attracts considerable public interest <e> <s> almost everyone who has participated has done so with the benefit of personal experience <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can reassure the movers of this amendment and the noble lord lord ennals also because there is and has been regular consultation with the local authority associations about the implementation of our community care policies <e> <s> this consultation takes place at both ministerial and regularly official level <e> <s> the views of the local authority associations are therefore well known and are being taken into account <e>", "<cs> i made it clear that they have been and are being consulted <e> <s> therefore it is unnecessary to repeat the process and duplicate the procedure <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble lord further by referring to the sort of timing that we have in mind <e> <s> after all we must await royal assent before we can move into the further detailed preparation of plans <e> <s> local authorities will then be directed to prepare plans and quite probably that will be towards the end of september after we have had feedback on guidance which is due to go out fairly soon <e>", "<cs> according to my grouping we are also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> ar <e>", "<cs> i cannot speak for or pre-empt another place in saying what will happen in regard to the ring-fencing amendment <e> <s> i am somewhat surprised that the noble baroness should ask me to attempt to do so <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult area and it was beneficial for the committee to be made aware of those examples <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend lady masham i point out that while anyone remains in hospital the health authority must foot the bill <e> <s> therefore the problem of bed blocking is best solved by co-operation between health and local authorities <e> <s> the problem cannot be solved by elaborate cross-charging systems between the authorities <e> <s> later today the committee will consider a government amendment no <e> <s> za which will require the social services departments to bring apparent housing needs to the attention of the housing authorities <e> <s> although that applies only where the authorities are separate we agree that a similar situation should apply when the same local authority is involved <e>", "<cs> i fully agree that it will be important to have proper and appropriate co-operation <e> <s> whether that can be achieved as a result of the provisions in the amendment is another matter <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i feel that it is very important to recognise that as valuable as is the co-operation about which we have been speaking that will not be achieved by writing something on the face of the bill <e> <s> that will be achieved by effective co-operation and methods of co-operation being developed at local level <e> <s> there are other ways of achieving that <e> <s> therefore in agreeing to consider the amendment i make that offer without commitment <e>", "<cs> as i pointed out in clause there is already reference to this matter <e> <s> that is the amendment which was introduced in another place <e>", "<cs> i would hate to cause so much surprise <e> <s> i am sorry that i have not been able to intervene sooner in this interesting discussion <e> <s> i have been keen to comply with the invitation made by the noble baroness lady seear and to underline the governments commitment to the involvement of users and carers in the whole process of planning through to service delivery and in achieving the best possible outcomes for the clients of the services <e>", "<cs> we always conscientiously read the debates that take place in the chamber <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear that i am speaking to the grouping of amendments nos <e> <s> bf to bh and to amendments nos <e> <s> zb zd ze aa ab and da as all those amendments have not been specificaly referred to before <e>", "<cs> the amendment and amendment no <e> <s> d to which we are also speaking would lay on authorities a duty to provide services to meet assessed needs <e> <s> as i have said as regards disabled people in domiciliary and day care local authorities are already under such a duty by virtue of section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> e addresses two situations <e> <s> the first is where a person needs services not provided by the social services department and the second where the person needs a specialist assessment involving skills not present among employees of the authority concerned <e> <s> i have already explained to the committee how the assessment process will work and that we intend that it should go wider than the statutory requirement which the bill lays on social services departments and would embrace health and housing needs <e> <s> the first part of this amendment shares that concern <e> <s> the second part overlaps with amendment no <e> <s> zc which like it concerns the need for social services departments to seek help from other bodies in carrying out community care needs assessment <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the use of the word guidance is different from the use of the word guidelines <e> <s> guidance apparently has some significance in that if an authority fails to observe guidance the secretary of state can enforce the suggestion by means of directions <e> <s> therefore the effect of guidance is quite strong <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness must do what she feels to be appropriate <e> <s> we have emphasised again and again that voluntary agencies will be consulted <e> <s> they will certainly be mentioned in the guidance <e>", "<cs> as i have said on a number of occasions the guidance will be put out for consultation <e> <s> it will be issued initially in draft form <e> <s> i have raised this in the context of certain specific amendments and specific guidance which will relate to the performance of those amendments <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord if i did not pick up his initial question <e> <s> as i understand it it will be issued in the form of a circular or a book and it will be comprehensive and detailed <e>", "<cs> i believe that i said yes <e>", "<cs> we do not feel it necessary to include either of the amendments as the government amendment amendment no <e> <s> za to which i have just spoken and to which the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies referred provides that if an assessment made by a local authority for the provision of community care services uncovers a housing need the person concerned will be referred to the housing authority <e> <s> it would be for the authority to act as appropriate <e>", "<cs> yes if the noble lord does not hold me to a timetable <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i recap the substantial progress that the government have made so far in implementing the disabled persons services consultation and representation act <e> <s> noble lords have referred to the passage of that act as a private members bill <e> <s> i am sure the committee would agree that any other approach to a complex measure of this kind other than according to the sensible proviso that it could only be implemented as the necessary resources were identified would have been irresponsible <e>", "<cs> there is not a great deal that i can add to my previous response because i dealt with the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord henderson in my comprehensive reply <e> <s> i remind members who have spoken to the amendment that the implemented sections of the act to which i referred sections and require local authorities to assess need on request <e> <s> i should find it amazing if someone who requested an assessment did not have their views taken into account <e>", "<cs> we touched on these arguments when discussing amendment no <e> <s> ap earlier and indeed amendment no <e> <s> af last tuesday <e> <s> the essential thing to remember is that if people are sufficiently affected by their illness or dependency whatever that may be and certainly not confined to those mentioned in this amendment then they will come within the existing definition in any event <e> <s> i am talking of course about the definition provided by section of the national assistance act which specifically refers to people who are substantially and permanently handicapped through illness and injury or for other reasons <e>", "<cs> local authorities should be answerable to their local population for the exercise of their community care responsibilities <e> <s> we already propose in the bill that plans for community care should be published as the noble lord has said and that local authorities should consult widely in drawing them up <e> <s> indeed clause includes an amendment accepted at report stage in another place to clarify the situation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been in politics longer than i have and it may be for that reason that i did not gain the same impression from the press comment <e> <s> however i can only reaffirm that the government will continue to keep the timetable under review in the light of circumstances <e> <s> for example we shall take careful note of what local authorities tell us about their preparations <e> <s> however april remains the date for implementation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take the opportunity to clarify the position slightly <e> <s> i referred to guidance not to guidelines <e> <s> we have established that guidance is a rather stronger weapon than guidelines in that respect because it is subject to the secretary of states power of directions <e> <s> as far as i am aware that guidance which has not yet been issued it is about to be issued can be made available to anyone who requests it <e> <s> in the normal course of events it will go out to health authorities and voluntary sector organisations which provide services in the area <e>", "<cs> this has been a most useful discussion <e> <s> if the amendment serves no other purpose it has enabled everyone to understand the problems and we hope the kinds of solutions that are available <e> <s> i am most grateful to everyone who took part particularly my noble friend lady faithfull for her act of courage and also my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton for reminding us to look at clause which gives persons authorised by the secretary of state a right to enter and inspect premises where community care services are provided if they are thought not to be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the committee that as i said the intention outlined in the white paper is to strengthen the role of the social services inspectorate in other words we will be building on the existing structure and experience <e> <s> the social services inspectorate will report to the secretary of state on the effectiveness of local inspection arrrangements and on the methodologies and standards applied when measuring the quality of services and care secured <e> <s> i hope that meets the point put by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> i said that there were inspectors <e>", "<cs> i understand that a similar amendment was tabled and discussed in another place <e> <s> therefore we are aware of the concern behind the amendment about the need for safeguards for <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness underlines the great difficulty which arises in this connection <e> <s> i referred to the contractual mechanism <e> <s> that is one of many safeguards <e> <s> in the situation just illustrated clearly that may not be very successful but we anticipate that it will be in others <e>", "<cs> i believe that this extends to domiciliary and day care services <e> <s> however i think perhaps i should check that fact and confirm it to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> clause gives the secretary of state pcwers to inspect premises where community care is being undertaken <e> <s> it does not exclude smaller homes <e>", "<cs> the answer to some of those queries is that the bill covers day and domiciliary services and small homes where there is a contract for the services <e> <s> that point applies equally to scotland <e> <s> we have perhaps not made it clear that we are talking about a group of amendments which include scottish amendments <e> <s> my noble friend has drawn that point to my attention <e> <s> those areas of concern are covered where a contract exists <e>", "<cs> it is much the same point as that raised by my noble friend lord renton when we were discussing the previous amendment <e> <s> clause refers to premises <e>", "<cs> it does not exclude them <e>", "<cs> the clause refers to premises and community care services which are being provided there <e> <s> it seems to me that the inspection of premises is to see not just that they are adequate but that the community care services that are being carried on there are adequate <e>", "<cs> when we refer to premises it seems that members of the committee are concerned about an individuals home as in the case of domiciliary care <e> <s> obviously there would be no question of an inspector inspecting the clients own home <e> <s> therefore we must draw the distinction between that and the inspection of the services provided in a clients home <e> <s> it follows that the reference in clause to <e>", "<cs> i believe that what is intended is clear that is to ensure that when a complaint is made a reasonable investigation can be carried out <e> <s> that meets much of the concern raised in the course of the discussion <e>", "<cs> i can answer yes to both of those questions <e>", "<cs> we recognise the important role of hospital social workers <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley has a long and distinguished record of bringing forward his anxieties about the adequate staffing of that work <e> <s> when he raised the matter previously he was worried that there was some kind of dispute between the department of health and the local authority associations over difficulties which had arisen over the appointment of those workers <e> <s> in my famous correspondence with him on that subject i had to point out that on the contrary the department has been doing its best to act as an honest broker <e>", "<cs> i hope to have a solution as early as possible but i cannot promise it before the bill leaves this place <e>", "<cs> it may help the committee if i begin by explaining the reasons for seeking the general power of direction set out in the first part of this clause <e> <s> in setting up the new community care <e>", "<cs> as there is no specific requirement that must be so but it is hard to envisage how in practice it could be otherwise than in writing <e> <s> the new provision goes further and enables the secretary of state to issue directions <e> <s> we see two main uses for these first they can be used to reinforce our guidance to ensure that important elements in it are taken into account by all local authorities and secondly it can be used where a local authority is failing to deliver an efficient service as a prelude to action under the new default powers which are also set out in this clause <e>", "<cs> we expect the default procedures in this clause to work in the following way <e> <s> the first stage will be when it comes to the secretary of states attention that an authority is failing to discharge its functions <e> <s> this may come from a number of directions the work of the social services inspectorate information received from organisations representing disabled people or by direct representations to the secretary of state by users of services <e> <s> the first thing the secretary of state needs to do is to satisfy himself that the authority has failed without reasonable excuse to exercise its functions <e> <s> this will entail some form of further investigation or inquiry and may if the secretary of state feels it would be useful include using the general powers of direction to direct the authority to exercise its functions in a particular way <e>", "<cs> as the committee will remember the government originally decided that the best way to ensure that adequate resources were directed to care-in-the-community policies was to provide those resources through the revenue support grant <e> <s> i shall not repeat all the arguments in favour of that proposal particularly if they are not comprehensible to my noble friend lord mancroft <e> <s> however we believe that it goes against the grain of our policies to offer local authorities new responsibilities and to ask them to be more fully accountable to their electorate on the one hand and then on the other hand determine from the centre <e>", "<cs> i recognise that similar powers already exist in section of the national assistance act and also in the provisions of the mental health scotland act <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull considers that the power to remove to another place on the order of a court is not sufficient <e> <s> however there are a number of difficulties regarding the proposal before us <e>", "<cs> the clauses on fund-holding practices and indicative prescribing budgets to which these amendments relate lay down the principles of these two new schemes and put in place a clear-cut framework for their implementation <e> <s> it is only right that this should be so <e> <s> parliament must have an opportunity to debate and approve the principles and the people who will have to carry through these proposals want to see the framework properly spelt out <e>", "<cs> the principles of the matters will have been subject to full debate by the time the bill eventually as we hope receives royal assent <e> <s> i am informed that there has been ample opportunity to debate these procedures because over amendments have so far been debated in both places <e> <s> my point is that the negative procedure permits a debate in both places <e> <s> however to require this in each and every case as the amendment suggests would be a little too much <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way i have to say that if the same amendments are tabled then he is bound to receive the same answers <e>", "<cs> my lords it was as a direct result of the thalidomide situation that the controls to which i have referred were built in in terms of licensing procedures <e> <s> sometimes it is argued that some herbal and homoeopathic medicines are inherently safe because they are natural <e> <s> but that is not always the case <e> <s> for example as regards herbal medicines which are currently the only natural medicinal products to be reviewed from time to time it has been necessary for the licensing authority to withdraw or restrict the use of particular herbs in medicinal products <e> <s> again although homoeopathic <e>", "<cs> indeed yes my lords <e> <s> i fully agree with the noble lord on this occasion that it should not be forgotten that modern pharmaceutical advances have produced incalculable benefits to sick people who would die or suffer needlessly without effective treatment for example organ transplants made possible by anti-rejection drugs anti-cancer drugs enabling the cure of certain childhood leukaemias the successful treatment of peptic ulcers with less recourse to surgery and anti-infective drugs without which many infections were previously fatal <e> <s> one could go on and on <e> <s> we look to new and further developments in modern pharmaceutical science for more lifesaving treatments in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for underlining that point <e> <s> i should also like to take the opportunity to re-emphasise the stringent safeguards built in to the licensing system and indeed the excellent system for voluntary notifications to the committee on the safety of medicines <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say to my noble friend that i welcome him to the consensus which prevails <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why those forms of treatment are available in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords they are available because we believe in freedom of choice <e>", "<cs> my lords in referring to the original question tabled by my noble friend which relates back to the debate we had some little time ago in your lordships house i confirm that we see this as a risk situation and that i did not point to any specific evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i emphasise that no formal applications have been received <e> <s> the expressions of interest to which the noble lord refers varied greatly and there have been a large number of them <e> <s> clearly they are not the objects of consultation <e> <s> when consultation takes place it will be after formal applications are invited <e> <s> it will take place in the usual way and regions will invite comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for giving me the opportunity to repeat that there is no question of any hospital opting out of the national health service <e> <s> those hospitals that apply for national health service trust status will remain fully within the national health service as they are at present <e> <s> if for some reason national health service trust status does not prove suitable in the long run there will be every possibility for a hospital to return to being directly managed by the health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords it is intended that not only staff but also local communities will have an opportunity to express their views <e>", "<cs> my lords there has already been much publicity regarding these expressions of interest <e> <s> as yet formal applications have not been invited <e> <s> there is no doubt that everybody concerned will be aware of what is happening in their locality <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said when formal applications are prepared regions will ensure that they are given local publicity and will seek the views of all those with an interest including health authorities staff patients gps chcs and the local <e>", "<cs> my lords when i say patients i mean patients in hospitals gps patients on registered lists and patients in the local community who after all are part of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper and the first working paper were issued in february <e> <s> an initial guide was then published in july and an executive letter was distributed in august <e> <s> it has been made clear in the guidance that consultation should take place over a three-month period <e> <s> i should add that a compendium guide is planned for issue in the autumn of this year <e> <s> all that guidance taken together should give plenty of advice or how the matter should be taken how the consultation should take place and i believe give adequate time for that consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords for - funding for the preparation and implementation of the national health service and community care bill for the nhs is expected to be around million in england for community care the standard spending figure for personal social services in - has been set at million an increase of per cent <e> <s> on the equivalent figure for - <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are now spending more than ever before on the national health service as the noble lord knows <e> <s> we believe that it is full justification for our reforms that as a result we shall be avoiding the regular crises in management that presently occur <e>", "<cs> my lords all women aged between and will be brought into the scope of the programme over the five years to <e> <s> that is in england <e> <s> as i understand it the effect of the screening system has been very beneficial in terms of the mortality rate but i do not have precise numbers to quote <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the new gps contract is extremely beneficial <e> <s> the contract as a whole places a much greater emphasis on health promotion and ill health prevention <e>

<e> <s> as at december around per cent <e> <s> of laboratories were meeting the target time for reporting results to the smear taker within one month <e> <s> action taken to reduce backlogs includes overtime working the employment of additional staff and the use of other laboratory facilities within the nhs and the private sector <e> <s> we believe that these facilities are working satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already quoted the varicus methods which are being used in order to improve that level <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously that varies in different parts of the country <e> <s> i do not have figures which give any kind of average but clearly the aim of the health authorities and the gps is to make that waiting period as short as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords though women aged years and over are not invited to be screened by the call and recall systems they are not excluded from the screening programme <e> <s> we have told health authorities that women of this age who have not had two consecutive negative smear tests in the past years should be screened <e> <s> we know that such women consult their doctor more than six times a year on average <e> <s> the new gps contract should provide additional opportunities for gps to offer a cervical smear test to women in this age group when appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully aware of increasing expectations in terms of the national health service and indeed the increased costs which new technology brings to it <e> <s> our aim is to achieve the best possible balance between spending for general basic services which historically the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that comment <e> <s> as the past years have shown cutting tax rates is not incompatible with spending more on the national health service <e> <s> the governments economic policies have led to growth enabling more money to be spent to improve services <e> <s> while the standard rate of income tax has fallen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> real national health spending has as i said grown by per cent <e> <s> it has increased both as a proportion of gdp and of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble lords particular pleading in this matter <e> <s> in general we are continuing the good trend by the formation of a specialist group to investigate still births and infant deaths by a critical review of research into cot deaths by the medical research council and by taking action to improve the capacity of the nhs to undertake post-mortems following infant deaths <e> <s> we hope that the picture will continue to improve throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his suggestion <e> <s> i should like to confirm once again that it is the governments low tax policies which have led to economic growth thus enabling the provision of better services <e>", "<cs> my lords i draw the noble lords attention to the fact that the question refers to personal taxation <e> <s> i also point out that after social security health is the second biggest item in the governments spending programme <e> <s> the figures prove that there is a greater throughput in terms of hospital treatment so while people may not be spending nights in beds they are being treated in hospitals <e> <s> there are more doctors and nurses and more patients being treated than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords we would be wise to be wary of polls showing that people are happy to pay more tax <e> <s> in any case as i have already said the government are spending more and improving services <e> <s> due to our successful economic policies the gdp has increased and the nhs share of the gdp has increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to check on the last point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> i have already pointed out that there is no question of there being a lack of funds <e> <s> there has been increased funding <e> <s> what is important is to achieve the proper management of that funding <e> <s> all the measures that the government have taken and are taking are intended to create a more efficient service and to improve the quality of clinical care and the delivery of care <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right as he so often is <e> <s> we hope that demand will always outstrip what we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords we are funding and have funded new hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the increased costs and demands of the nhs <e> <s> our reforms are intended to improve that service to make it more efficient and to improve its quality <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have no difficulty in accepting the underlying aims of the proposed new clause but i deplore the attempt to continue to scaremonger about the reforms <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord ennals is strongly against them but i must correct the impression that he gave about the so-called rubber windmill experiment <e> <s> as the regional general manager for east anglia has said the purposes of the exercise was to test the concept of contracting to see whether it could be pushed to breaking point <e> <s> it showed that while that is possible when pushed in the way that it was the checks and balances built into our proposals especially the emphasis on quality will prevent it from happening in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that this is part and parcel of proper management and requires no statutory provision <e> <s> i also pointed to the mechanisms which already exist <e> <s> as a result of the procedures to which the noble lord lord butterfield referred they include the placing in the libraries of both houses copies of letters referring to the monitoring in each region at the end of each year <e> <s> i have also pointed to the mechanisms that exist in both houses for ways of bringing ministers to account <e> <s> on that basis we believe that the amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it an amendment to an amendment must be taken in this order <e> <s> i regret to say that this was not apparently taken into account when we were preparing the groupings so it catches some of us on the hop <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help by saying that it is the governments intention to accept the amendments tabled by my noble friend lady young and the noble lord lord dainton <e> <s> perhaps on that basis it will be helpful to continue in now discussing the amendment to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of this short debate we have perhaps strayed slightly from the essential point <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to preface my remarks by saying that the government are fully aware of the essential part played by polytechnics and other institutions of higher education in the education and training of staff serving in many areas of the national health service <e> <s> there can be no doubt of the parity of esteem in which the polytechnics are held as establishments of higher learning <e> <s> i stress that point because in finding that i must reject the thinking behind this amendment i wish to underline the gratitude we all owe to those whose work is to train the staff of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that the needs of disabled people account for a significant and increasing demand on health service provision <e> <s> i quite agree with the general point and your lordships know that the government place a high priority on services to the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships are already familiar with the governments intention to leave health authorities and the new fhsas as free as possible from membership restrictions <e> <s> the suggested exclusion potentially could deprive the national health service of the benefits of much valuable experience <e> <s> as my right honourable friend made clear in another place and as i explained in committee health authority appointments will not be made where it is clear that there will be a substantial conflict of interest in relation to the authority <e> <s> those decisions can only be made by looking at individual cases <e> <s> it would not necessarily <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be the normal ways of finding out <e> <s> a major conflict of interest may be apparent from the cv of the candidate <e> <s> obviously that kind of background information will be the norm <e> <s> otherwise in terms of interviewing techniques it will be one of the questions that will be asked <e> <s> it is our intention that the matter should be included in the guidance that will be issued in respect of these appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be new membership regulations that will be supplemented by guidance when necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords following our discussions earlier on similar amendments on junior doctors hours i had hoped that your lordships would agree that talks recently begun by my right honourable friend the minister for health on this very important subject should be allowed to run their course and achieve the results that we all hope they will achieve <e> <s> the government have accepted that it is sensible to work towards a target of an average week of duty of hours for all junior hospital doctors <e> <s> the national health service trusts will also be expected to comply with government policy on junior doctors hours <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that the working group should be given a fair chance to see what it can achieve <e> <s> any effort to put such a requirement into legislation would pre-empt that possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the modifications made by the noble lord lord hunter and his fellow proposers to similar amendments that we discussed at committee stage <e> <s> we agree that it is a good idea to have outside advice and that that advice should be broadly based to include the relevant industrial scientific and medical research interests to which my noble friend lord carr referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the overriding objective of the proposals in this bill is to improve services throughout the national health service to improve the quality of clinical care and to improve the delivery of care <e> <s> the establishment of the clinical standards advisory group which we shall come to later in our discussions will be a major step towards ensuring that this objective is achieved <e> <s> however even a body like the clinical standards advisory group can only assist and encourage work at local level which is where the essential tasks of improving standards will be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the intentions behind the amendment of the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> a key aim of the reforms is to improve waiting times by enabling health authorities to place contracts with units where waits are short <e> <s> the need to attract funding through contracts will in itself encourge all hospitals to become more efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i can again assure my noble friend that the government fully recognise the importance of speech therapy services <e> <s> nothing in this bill will prevent those who need speech therapy from obtaining it <e> <s> district health authorities will have a clear duty to ensure that their residents have access to a comprehensive range of services <e> <s> that will include speech therapy <e> <s> the only difference will be that in future speech therapy services will be placed on a contractual basis in the same way as all other health care services <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i dealt fully with the matter when moving the amendment <e> <s> in response to the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear about the regional health authority being in effect a judge in its own court the decision is for the secretary of state <e> <s> the regional health authority simply acts as his agent in carrying out the consultation <e> <s> i can categorically assure your <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the noble lords remarks about the proposed hospital incentive fund and agree with much of what he said about the need to support innovative work at local level <e> <s> i can certainly assure the noble lord lord hunter that sufficient statutory power exists at present to allow such schemes as he has described to operate at a national or regional level <e> <s> of course a management judgment must be made about the desirability of channelling resources into such incentive funds as opposed to going into the main allocations to health authorities <e> <s> however the option is always there <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord finds that reassuring <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise and fully share the commitment of your lordships house to the highest possible standards of medical education and research <e> <s> the amendment provides reassurance to the academic community and properly enshrines the governments intended commitments in the law <e> <s> i therefore urge your lordships to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed similar amendments in committee and the committee divided on an amendment moved by the noble lord lord walton which was lost <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> brings us back in essence to the question of ballots because it will presumably need a ballot of staff to determine if a majority would wish the trust to be dissolved <e> <s> the decision to apply for dissolution of the trust is not one to be taken lightly and i do not believe that it is a suitable issue to be decided by a ballot <e> <s> in addition the proposed amendment would discriminate against other interested parties who would not be given the right to ballot on applying for the dissolution of the trust <e> <s> furthermore the amendment would mean that the majority view of the staff of the trust would itself be grounds for dissolving the trust however small the majority and <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather assumed that the effect of the amendment of the noble lord would be to bring us back to the question of ballots whereas we have placed a duty on the secretary of state to consult if dissolution appears necessary <e> <s> he would therefore wish to take account of the views of all staff before making a decision as part of that consultation process <e> <s> we would not wish to follow the course suggested by the amendment of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should say that precisely how the views of staff were obtained for the purposes of dissolution of a trust could be specified for example in regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the reorganisation of the beds which relate to westminster hospital was announced in april <e> <s> on the whole the arrangement is in the best interests of patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my right honourable friend the secretary of state always does his best to argue for more funds for the national health service <e> <s> he has been very effective in doing so <e> <s> the arrangements made for the transfer and reorganisation of specialties and beds within the riverside district have been made with a view to providing the best possible results for patients <e>", "<cs> my lords the regional health authority has recently referred the matter to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> it is now under consideration but a final decision has not been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords westminster is a special case for many reasons including those mentioned by the noble baroness <e> <s> this factor is taken into account in making decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may certainly ask that but i am afraid that i am not able to give him an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords although the cost of treating patients from european community member states is met by the health authorities and any moneys received in respect of that treatment from those states is retained in central funds and the health authorities are not therefore currently reimbursed for the treatment that they provide for overseas visitors perhaps i may remind noble lords that neither are they charged for treatment provided overseas for uk nationals from their catchment areas <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original response those arrangements have been the subject of consultation which has had to take place with the territorial health departments as well as with the national health service <e> <s> the service will be consulted further on the detailed working arrangements <e> <s> because of the current system the number of treatments and the costs of treatment are not known precisely so exact figures are difficult to provide <e> <s> our best estimate is that about million per annum will be required in all <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are fortunate in that other countries wish to refer their patients to this country for specialised treatment <e> <s> i should add that not only does that happen under special arrangements and on the national health service but that referrals are sometimes made for specific payment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier it is difficult to give precise figures because of the nature of the current system <e> <s> clearly that is particularly true of accident and emergency cases which form part of the system <e> <s> with the further costs of ward admissions out-patient clinics and general practitioners it is estimated that on balance the cost of treatment received by uk nationals overseas is slightly higher than the cost of treatment of ec nationals treated over here so the balance is in our favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that although the amendment may have been presented as being modest it is unnecessary <e> <s> provision is already made in the bill to ensure that staff who transfer from health authority to national health service trust employment do so with all their contractual rights intact <e> <s> similarly statutory continuity of service which governs redundancy and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked why clause and not his amendment <e> <s> clause is necessary because the provisions of clauses and which cover the position foreseen by the noble lords amendment do not apply to the transfer covered by them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the many fronts on which there have been considerable discussion and frequent meetings with representatives of the medical profession <e> <s> i believe that even in your lordships house there are members of the medical profession who welcome this aspect of our proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the importance of mobility of service and that is why the bill has made provision to protect staffs who move or intend to move in accordance with the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the main aims underlying the entire bill before us is as the noble lord lord winstanley has just pointed out to improve the quality of care and the delivery of care in the national health service and to do this we certainly need to promote economy and efficiency <e> <s> but by putting stress on this i would not wish in any way to relegate what is perhaps the most important of the triumvirate of es and that is effectiveness <e> <s> and i mean by that not just cost-effectiveness but effectiveness in the widest sense including clinical effectiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share the concern for patients which has motivated the amendment of the noble baroness and many of the contributions that we have heard this afternoon <e> <s> i recognise the anxieties that have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have obviously made it less than crystal-clear that indicative prescribing budgets mean precisely what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> i confirm that the safeguard will remain in place <e> <s> i sought to explain the fact that a patient must have the permission of his gp before he could change and find another doctor <e> <s> it is that aspect which has been changed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to argue with my noble friend as members on the benches opposite are well aware <e> <s> however if a provision is not necessary we prefer not to have it in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill already provides for regulations to be made setting out the conditions to be fulfilled for obtaining recognition as fund holding practices <e> <s> that will be supplemented as necessary by detailed guidance <e> <s> therefore the criteria will be a matter of record and no one will be left in any doubt about the basis on which applications are considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the mechanisms in relation to general monitoring indeed include the chcs but primarily will be the regional health authorities and above them the national health service management executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can be reassuring on this amendment <e> <s> the principle behind the practice funding initiative is to use gps undoubted expertise and experience so that nhs money can be used in the way that fund holders judge best for their patients <e> <s> the scheme provides gps with greater flexibility in the way they provide care to their patients <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said we have discussed this subject before <e> <s> then as now i listened with great interest and considerable sympathy <e> <s> however it is not so simple a matter as the noble earl and indeed others have suggested <e> <s> indeed his step-by-step approach in itself creates <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that the term indicative budget has been misunderstood and misrepresented despite our best efforts to assure doctors and patients that the word budget does not represent a limit on

proposition put forward by the noble lord lord walton on behalf of the noble lord lord butterfield my noble friend lord sanderson will bring forward parallel scottish amendments also on third reading

contributions from my noble friends and indeed from others who have emphasised the need for account to be taken of the amount of spending on drugs <e> <s> in that sense i recognise that we have the agreement of the house that the proposal of the government is acceptable <e> <s> it is important that in prescribing drugs gps should be conscious of the facts of life that were so aptly described by

have the reassurance of the noble lord lord peston that it is appreciated that there are ultimate cash limits <e> <s> i thought it worth mentioning that in the context of these discussions <e> <s> in saying that i hope that the assurances that i have been able to repeat will be felt to be adequate and satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been suggested that it would be helpful if i intervene at this stage to speak particularly to government amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> since we are speaking to a much wider grouping i will happily respond at the end to any points raised in the course of further debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the independence of the group i believe that the expertise of its members will enable it to become a respected source of advice on clinical quality complementing the drive to improve standards in the national health service both locally and nationally <e> <s> in answer to the specific question which the noble lord lord ennals has just raised there will be nothing to prevent the group initiating activity though we would largely expect it to respond to requests <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why it is most useful to have this opportunity to explain the intentions behind this amendment <e> <s> it was certainly on this basis that the agreement was reached with the royal colleges an agreement which i hope your lordships will all feel is very valuable and will be very important in having an effective body in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that we were discussing the whole grouping now <e> <s> certainly my noble friend lord mottistone has spoken to a number of amendments in the group as indeed have other noble lords <e> <s> naturally if i am unable to satisfy any areas of doubt in noble lords minds this evening and at this stage in order to avoid a rediscussion of the whole issue on third reading i shall certainly be willing to have a meeting as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house our procedures on report are becoming rather irregular i have tried to convey that the best way forward is that the wording of the amendment should be as general as possible and as we have agreed it with the royal colleges <e> <s> it is not necessary to do as the noble lord suggests in order to meet his anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed a similar amendment at committee stage i explained that the government were looking actively at the funding of continuing and postgraduate education for the caring profession and that a group of interested professionals led by the chief medical officer had helped in those deliberations <e> <s> i also explained that we had already decided that there should be a clearly defined budget for postgraduate and continuing education and that we were examining further how best that budget should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind your lordships that it is world no smoking day this thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe i said that the meeting would be after the bill had received royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i respond first to the point raised by my noble friend lord mancroft <e> <s> the reference to authority is to local government authority <e> <s> i have been trying to relate this to the bill because i realise that in the bill we tend to refer to local authorities when speaking about local government authorities as opposed to health authorities but in this instance we are referring to another act and therefore to the terminology in that act <e> <s> i think the house will find that in that context the word authority is defined as a local government authority <e> <s> of course i will make absolutely sure that we are being entirely consistent <e>", "<cs> my lords we are running into difficulties in our procedures at this report stage <e> <s> with the leave of the house i can say that further is used in the context of such community care services as there are available which will be if necessary those provided by voluntary organisations <e> <s> in response to the other question raised by the noble baroness we do not want to be limiting about the length of time for which care is covered <e> <s> it will be the length of time that is necessary for adequate assessments to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i ask the noble lord to look at subsection b <e> <s> above the reference to a district health authority there is reference to an authority with a small a <e> <s> that is why i said that we shall have to look at the matter <e> <s> i take the point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i point out that our amendment says that as soon as practicable arrangements should be made <e> <s> on the whole that must be a short period <e> <s> if there is a need for a longer period obviously that will be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords on the procedural question we are getting a little out of hand <e> <s> report stage requires that people speak only once to amendments within reason <e>", "<cs> my lords it clearly was not clear <e> <s> i appreciate that questions have to be asked but there are limits to the number of questions that need to be asked <e> <s> that intervention has caused me to forget almost entirely what my noble friend was asking me <e>", "<cs> my lords we would expect that a voluntary organisation offering the services that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is undoubtedly an important and serious issue and one on which there is some strength of feeling in your lordships house <e> <s> i wish to respond as positively as i can to the case that has been made <e> <s> it is not inconsistent with my wish to be positive to argue as i intend to that the amendment should not be pursued <e> <s> in our earlier debate on criminal record checks i described the safeguards that are already built into the system so i shall try to deal briefly with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i quoted were in relation to the child protection requirements <e> <s> i do not have estimated figures to offer to the noble baroness <e> <s> but from experience and as a result of advice in discussions with the association of chief police officers i do not believe that the association agrees with the noble baroness that the number of cases that would have to be investigated would be small <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point and his reference to clause <e> <s> however i am not excluding all possibilities <e> <s> i am simply saying in my response that in view of all the work that has been undertaken on this and the progress that we hope will be made it is not timely to accept an amendment of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the anxiety that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that the government fully recognise the importance of residential care for drug and alcohol misusers and the care that the voluntary sector provides <e> <s> i have had a series of meetings with representatives of the voluntary sector about this subject and was invited to respond to the all-party group on those matters in another place <e> <s> we are therefore well aware of the problem <e>", "<cs> by direction my lords <e> <s> i have also ensured that express reference is made to these services in the draft guidance to which reference has already been made and which is due out tomorrow <e> <s> this should ensure that services for these clients are considered by local authorities on an equal footing with services for other client groups <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house all the organisations that i met intimated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say to the noble lord that the requirement that he seeks to add to the bill is already covered by relevant legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords because we recognise the need for a seamless service for patients being discharged from hospital and in particular the special needs of those who have had treatment for a mental disorder we have taken steps to address the situation <e> <s> first we have issued guidance on discharge planning for all patients <e> <s> that was issued in a comprehensive circular last year <e> <s> it covered the care of patients released after a short spell in hospital as well as of those who have received long-term care <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to worry the noble lord but it will be quite a large document <e> <s> we have not been aware of the date of todays discussions sufficiently early namely at the initiation of the consultations which had to take place to enable us to have the guidance in the lap of the noble lord at what he considers to be the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house my noble friend has in a sense contradicted himself in his last remarks in that he has pointed to a matter which is enshrined in legislation and then said that that was not effective that is section of the mental health act <e>", "<cs> my lords i have pointed to the various forms of guidance which will as i said earlier flesh out the framework of care the general principle of which is established in this bill <e> <s> after all this is a framework bill and it provides the necessary legal framework <e> <s> i have explained at an earlier stage of the bill that guidance carries a great deal of clout <e> <s> in draft it is subject to considerable consultation so that it is not something which is in any way prepared secretly <e> <s> if not complied with it is for the secretary of state to enforce the guidance by giving the necessary directions <e> <s> the position therefore is well covered and i hope that your lordships will recognise that <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in relation to a previous amendment i said that a fixed amount of time can very often become a maximum amount of time and create inflexibility in an area where we believe flexibility to be important <e> <s> as i said in relation to an earlier amendment on a slightly different topic assessment will take as long as is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the guidance is being issued in draft form for the purpose of receiving comments and advice from relevant bodies <e> <s> i have listed them at some length <e> <s> they will be able to make any necessary amendments should the draft guidance be found to be wanting <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot prejudge whether or not the amendment that your lordships have already voted on and to which the noble lord lord seebohm referred will find favour in another place <e> <s> in any event i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> the requirement to consult with housing authorities in respect of community care plans is in the bill at clause c <e> <s> for that reason the noble lords amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> what can sensibly and realistically be done in this part of our bill which concerns the powers and duties of local authorities in respect of community care functions has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am so sorry <e> <s> having considered the matter raised by the noble baroness lady seear we have brought forward the amendments which would incorporate into the bill the requirement for local authorities to consult organisations representing service users their families or carers <e> <s> i explained previously that the government fully support the principle behind the amendment which now places the requirement on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the more or less general welcome given to these government amendments <e> <s> but i have to say that i am amazed if organisations consisting of disabled people are not able to represent the interests of disabled people then who can do so <e> <s> in my view they are the people best able to represent disabled interests <e> <s> therefore the government amendment includes groups of disabled people as well as other groups interested in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords this issue was discussed at committee stage <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the main problem with section of the national assistance act is that there is no interim action no halfway house <e> <s> section provides only for removal <e> <s> that may seem to be a limited provision but there are good reasons why it should be so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and that can be done by agreement <e> <s> care can be taken of a person in the home in the vast majority of cases <e> <s> however there are other cases where there is a danger that civil liberties may be infringed <e> <s> a person may require entry in order to carry out domiciliary provisions or something of that sort but the recipient of that care may not be agreeable and there could be difficult and damaging scenes <e> <s> i am sure that no one wants that <e> <s> as my noble friend said it is not her intention to force services on people <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully appreciate the valuable part that respite care can play in giving hard pressed carers a much needed break <e> <s> i should remind the noble baroness that the number of short-term admissions to local authority residential care homes in england which we may take as an index of respite care went up from in to in a rise of per cent <e> <s> so it is going in the right direction <e> <s> we have said repeatedly in discussions on this clause both in this chamber and in another place that our guidance to local authorities on assessment guidance which can if necessary be reinforced by directions from the secretary of state will advise authorities to involve users and carers fully in the assessment process and in the subsequent issues on service provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite willing to have a meeting whenever it is convenient to other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i am not able to add anything to what i have said <e> <s> it amounts to the fact that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that access to medical records should be very tightly controlled to prevent them falling into the wrong hands <e> <s> that is a very well-established principle in health care management <e> <s> that is why clause prohibits anyone other than a registered medical practitioner from inspecting medical records during the course of an inspection <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at report stage <e> <s> the long title refers clearly to the social services functions of local authorities <e> <s> the clause is <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord sanderson explained when speaking to the original grouping this amendment is designed to increase the scope for complaints <e> <s> it does not rule out complaints by or on behalf of clients by carers <e> <s> instead it allows for complaints at any stage of the assess tent process <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that there is a strong feeling about the issue <e> <s> on several occasions we have discussed whether there is a case for ring fencing community care <e> <s> the government have carefully considered their position following the committees decision to support amendments which bear on the subject <e> <s> apart from the important point that ring fencing limits local flexibility and determination all the evidence thus far shows that expenditure on personal social services does well out of non-ring-fenced funding and has risen substantially in real terms as compared with other lower areas of expenditure <e> <s> the reason why we must make an exception to that general policy for those who are mentally ill is that this is an area where we know well that resources have been inadequately applied and that in some cases services have been less than we would have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the whole object of the exercise of requiring local authorities to produce community care plans is to create much greater transparency <e> <s> first they must consult in the preparation of those plans secondly they must publish the plans <e> <s> the provisions that they are making will be evident and interested parties will have every opportunity to be involved in the process <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat the assurance given by my noble friend lord henley at the earlier stage that all mentally ill people at whatever stage of illness are covered by the definition in the bill and that no further explanation or clarification is required <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent we are <e>", "<cs> my lords we had some discussion on this amendment last week <e> <s> i should like to point out again although it means repeating <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i can add anything to what i said today and last week <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment makes it clear that the responsibility for standards of clinical care should rest with the clinical standards advisory group which amendment no <e> <s> establishes and not with the nhs management executive <e> <s> that is not the way i see the respective functions of those two very different bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that i am right in assuming that the noble lord lord ennals is speaking to all three amendments in this grouping <e> <s> as the noble lord lord winstanley pointed out amendments nos <e> <s> and contain the essence of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that throughout the passage of the bill we have given categoric assurances that the employment rights and contractual terms of staff being transferred from the employment of a health authority will be protected on transfer <e> <s> clauses and already provide for that <e> <s> we certainly expect trusts to act in accordance with good employment practices when negotiating any changes to contracts and setting up the industrial relations machinery for doing so <e> <s> there is no need to place them under a special legal requirement not applying to any other employer <e> <s> trusts are in the same position as any other employer as regards employment legislation <e> <s> there is also no justification for requiring changes to be approved by trade unions when the individuals concerned have said that they are willing to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best <e> <s> we have been over the ground of this amendment on a number of occasions and i have paid tribute to those of your lordships who have throughout our debates made the case so effectively and eloquently on behalf of those who may be or have recently been dependent on drugs or alcohol <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mancroft said we responded by meeting specific anxieties on emergency treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always said that adequate resources will be provided for the community care provisions in this bill <e> <s> i stand by that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> our intention in relation to clause has always been to ensure that local authorities consult the appropriate bodies when drawing up plans and the amendment helps that process <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a difficult situation <e> <s> i know from earlier discussions that my noble friend lady faithfull is concerned that civil liberties should not be infringed by expecting people to receive services that they do not want <e> <s> however she is also concerned about the provision of care for those who are unable to ask for the services that they may require <e> <s> i recognise that my noble friend has altered the drafting of her amendment in order to achieve that <e> <s> however i am advised that there remain deficiencies in the drafting <e> <s> for example subsection ii would be unworkable <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case there would have to be the fallback of the last resort situation of section of the national assistance act <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest and considerable sympathy to the points that have been made <e> <s> this is an important area as we established in our previous discussions on similar amendments <e> <s> indeed the meeting to which the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth referred and to which i agreed on report was useful and constructive <e> <s> i very much appreciate the time and effort which has been put in to assist ministers to understand better the aspirations of these groups and the practicalities of achieving them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that this amendment is not required <e> <s> clause which amends the various provisions under which local authorities can provide or arrange the provision of services has the effect that services must be arranged either with private or voluntary residential care homes which are registered under the registered homes act homes which are not required to be registered by various provisions in the registered homes act and for day and domiciliary care voluntary organisations or persons carrying on professionally or by way of trade or business activities which consist of or include the provision of the services in question <e> <s> that means that the premises to be inspected will be managed by one of the bodies mentioned in the first part of the noble lords amendment unless they are a private dwelling house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must point out that the persons authorised by the secretary of state to carry out the inspections to which clause refers will be drawn for the most part from the social services inspectorate and from other members of the staff of the department of health <e> <s> when such people are not doctors they are almost certain to be qualified in one or other of the caring professions for instance nurses social workers or therapists <e> <s> such people would be bound by their own professional codes of conduct which place clear limits on the unauthorised disclosure of information gained in the course of professional activities <e> <s> even where this might not be the case the people concerned would still be covered by the codes of conduct covering the use made by civil servants of information gained in the course of their employment <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> in this grouping is a government amendment <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will support the change in the long title to the bill proposed by this amendment to take account of the proposed establishment of the group as the proposal to set up a group has been generally welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee we had a full discussion on a group of amendments including an amendment in the name of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> on a division an amendment tabled in the name of the noble lord lord walton of detchant in similar terms to this amendment was lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the kind words which have been expressed both on my own behalf and on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> i am grateful too for the more or less general welcome given to the bill and very grateful for the brevity of the latest contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> relates to scotland only <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is to extend the power to provide microbiological facilities to the district councils and to mirror the provisions for the rest of great britain <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and have two main purposes <e> <s> both are designed to bring the provisions of the bill regarding food examiners who carry out microbiological examinations more closely into line with those concerning public analysts who deal with chemical analysis and composition

beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered a <e> <s> the reasons for disagreement with the amendment centred on the fact that the amendment would put off virtually indefinitely the implementation of community care policy <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships intended to render it virtually impossible to take forward a policy the principles of which are widely supported but as i argued during our earlier deliberations that is what we were in danger of doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly in reply to that point discussions on financial implications are continuing with local authority representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered a <e> <s> that reason is that the position has changed since we debated this amendment and your lordships decided to put it into the bill <e> <s> at that time concern was expressed in all parts of the house that negotiations with the home office and the association of chief police officers about an administrative arrangement were getting nowhere <e> <s> i am happy to be able to say to your lordships that there has now been a breakthrough <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that no power is necessary for the scheme and that regulations relating to spent convictions are already <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i can confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the amendment is unworkable in legal terms because the effect would be that the authority would have to consult and collaborate within itself <e> <s> it would be extraordinary to require on the face of the bill different departments of the same authority to <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord that all cases in this category are appalling and tragic <e> <s> in the department we have read the nspccs figures with interest <e> <s> we note that they are based on out of authorities and are collected at a different time of the year from the departments figures <e> <s> the early returns to the department from about authorities for the year ending st march do not support the increase of the order suggested by the nspcc figures <e> <s> any increase or indication of increase must however be a matter of concern <e> <s> we continue with our commitment to provide a proper framework to ensure the protection of children from abuse <e> <s> we shall continue to work closely with the nspcc in the valuable work it is doing on this and many other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put it on the record very well on behalf of us all <e>", "<cs> my lords we are looking closely at the situation and monitoring it in the normal way <e> <s> as i have explained we have an annual system of returns <e> <s> the returns are coming to the department in the usual way <e> <s> however i point out to the noble lord that in response to what appears to be an increasing problem the number of field social workers has increased <e> <s> my figures indicate that it has increased from in to in <e> <s> the government are making available additional training grants million in grants to support a million programme in <e> <s> since local authority spending on personal social services has increased by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> if training is the area requiring attention it seems that we are moving forward <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords that is an important point <e> <s> i shall draw it to the attention of my honourable friend who is responsible in the department for that area <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot help the noble lord <e> <s> all the returns have not yet come in and therefore we do not have the final figures <e> <s> i indicated that the nspcc figures were based on out of authorities <e> <s> our returns are based on out of authorities <e> <s> i am advised that there can be a great deal of variety in the returns depending on the geographical location from which they come <e> <s> it is therefore rather difficult to take a meaningful average if the figures are to be averaged out <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is a very difficult situation <e> <s> i think that everyone concerned whether working in the department the voluntary sector or in local authorities takes the matter very seriously <e> <s> i gather that it is largely a question of the management of the investment of funds rather than their adequacy which is at issue <e> <s> nevertheless as i said in a previous response in terms of the kind of integrated approach that has been suggested i shall draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with my noble friends last point <e> <s> my understanding is that the problem appears to be greater in inner-city <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that social service is an integrated activity even if it is not integrated with other services to the extent which has been suggested today <e> <s> we follow the generic social work approach in this matter advocated by the seebohm report <e> <s> i am inclined to agree with the noble lord lord mellish that it is virtually impossible to have total surveillance in these cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully realise that anxieties have been expressed in that regard <e> <s> we have asked laboratories to report the results of routine cervical smears within a month <e> <s> some laboratories have reported increased difficulties due to gps making extra efforts to boost coverage but our information from health authorities shows that around per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of laboratories achieve that one month target <e> <s> however we shall of course keep the situation under review as will the health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lords first question i believe that there are certain at-risk categories which can be identified as urgent <e> <s> obviously in the routine call and recall system one would not know whether a case was urgent until the results were received <e> <s> however in those cases presumably the women concerned would not be suffering the same anxiety as somebody for whom a test has been recommended for specific reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper refers specifically to the gp contract <e> <s> it is very difficult to predict the impact of that contract because the returns for the first quarter since the contract has been in operation are not all in yet <e> <s> however we are keeping the situation under review <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many possible responses to meet that particular problem <e> <s> they include the possibility of tests being taken in hospital or arrangements being made with women doctors in other practices <e>", "<cs> my lords we have recognised that women have the right to choose not to accept what <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a tragic case <e> <s> wandsworth health authority and the local authoritys social services department have welcomed the publication of the report of the independent review panel and its recommendations <e> <s> many steps have already been taken to implement the recommendations in particular as regards guidelines to health visitors record keeping communication and training supervision and monitoring <e> <s> however i must emphasise that wandsworth area child protection committee established that resources were not an issue in the case involving the death of stephanie fox <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that my right honourable and learned friend in another place made any such statement <e> <s> he was merely answering questions resulting from press speculation on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pleased about and are encouraging further co-operation between local and health authorities <e> <s> we have recently published a guide to arrangements for inter-agency co-operation for the protection of children from abuse entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that we are straying rather far from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i repeat that questions answered yesterday relate to press speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we recognise that to be a very important area <e> <s> i understand that all wandsworth spending committees are reviewing current and prospective expenditure but no final decisions will be made until the autumn committee cycle <e>", "<cs> my lords the department offers a number of facilities to ensure co-ordination and routinely issues guidance to local authorities on best practice <e> <s> it has recently hosted a national conference for chairmen of area child protection committees the proceedings of which are soon to he published <e> <s> in addition several projects in the departments central training initiative are concerned with child sexual abuse and as part of the training support programme a special development group has produced guidelines for local authority training officers to assist with the planning of staff training in that area <e> <s> furthermore the social services inspectorate produces reports which highlight good practice <e> <s> those reports are published nationally <e>", "<cs> my lords i refute any suggestion that the government are washing their <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> a number of initiatives are being taken in order to recruit both health visitors and social workers <e> <s> in particular mature entrants are being targeted for example by the offer of part-time training courses as well through an advertising campaign and other measures <e>", "<cs> my lords that is already happening both at departmental and local levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i can confirm what she says <e> <s> i re-emphasise that as in many other areas there is a particular problem in london as regards recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the answer is in the affirmative but i shall check and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the special report pointed to the fact that the problem was not a lack of funding <e> <s> however there may be a problem with the management of funding and we are making sure that that is looked into <e>", "<cs> my lords as in all health service matters the health authorities determine the level of chiropody provision in their areas <e> <s> i am well aware of the training and qualifications which full time chiropodists require <e> <s> at th september there were chiropodists employed by the nhs an increase of or per cent <e> <s> over the figure <e> <s> furthermore the number of students qualifying increased from to some per cent <e> <s> over the same period <e> <s> i understand that the problem is rather that there are too many qualified people rather than not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is fulfilling its role by concentrating on the training aspects of this matter <e> <s> as i said it is for health authorities to provide the level of services required in their areas <e> <s> however i recognise that the london foot hospital has a worldwide reputation <e>", "<cs> my lords as in other areas of provision expectations are on the increase <e> <s> however i submit that provision is also on the increase <e> <s> if the noble lord was referring to the cartwright report called <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is a fairly wide use of the word chiropodist <e> <s> however any chiropodist employed in the national health service is required to be state-registered <e> <s> in essence that means that only those people who have successfully completed a three-year training course approved by the chiropodists board of the council for the professions supplementary to medicine are eligible for nhs employment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the figures for students in training <e> <s> that is an important factor <e>", "<cs> my lords a three year qualification period for the type of work undertaken by chiropodists in the national health service is not considered excessive <e> <s> nevertheless there are foot care assistants being trained and employed in the national health service whose training requirements are somewhat shorter <e>", "<cs> my lords nhs trusts will remain fully part of the national health service and will continue to provide services for nhs patients free of charge at the point of use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assist the noble lord by making absolutely clear that nhs trusts will not opt out of the national health service <e> <s> that has been said on many occasions prior to the statement made by the prime minister to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> they will remain firmly part of the national health service <e> <s> they will continue to provide treatment free of charge at the point of delivery <e> <s> however what will change is that they will take over responsibility for their own management from district health authorities <e> <s> the other units to which the noble lord referred are for example ambulance units not just hospital units <e>", "<cs> my lords if the bma had not carried on such an unnecessary campaign perhaps it would not have been necessary to have had this leaflet in the first place <e> <s> having said that certainly in regard to the nhs trusts the employees will be employed by <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e> <s> nevertheless it is important that the patients or consumers who will benefit from our reforms should understand perfectly and properly what those reforms are and not be misled <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend that our community care policy should get under way on st april <e> <s> as we have said for all our plans under the national health service and community care act implementation will be evolutionary <e>", "<cs> my lords we considered very carefully the arguments for ring-fencing which were advanced by the noble lord among others <e> <s> however we believe that many of those arguments could be applied to other local authority programmes <e> <s> we are not seeking to take over responsibilities of local authorities for community care but to support and encourage them by providing the right legislative and financial framework and helping to develop good managerial and professional practice <e> <s> we shall continue to do that between now and the full implementation of the community care arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that will teach the noble lord that it is not wise to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the many people in the field and throughout the service who are interested in the implementation of our community care proposals <e> <s> i have said on previous occasions that we are delighted at the welcome given to our proposals <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we still plan that implementation of the arrangements should get under way on st april <e> <s> nevertheless as i am sure the noble lord is aware an opposition debate on community care implementation in another place is scheduled for wednesday of this week <e> <s> no doubt my right honourable friend the secretary of state will then make a statement about the timetable <e> <s> i cannot anticipate the contents of that statement today <e>", "<cs> to that my lords i can only say yes <e>", "<cs> my lords in my experience those arrangements are left to the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout our many discussions on this topic we have always made it clear that much of the detail had still to be sorted out <e> <s> we certainly do not wish to slow down authorities who are getting ahead with their work on agreements with other agencies planning their services and moving their approach to one of greater consumer and client orientation <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt that will be made clear <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> we spend more than per head on the national health service each year compared with at todays prices when we came to power <e> <s> that is almost a week for each and every one of us <e>", "<cs> yes my lords they are figures for total expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords it cost almost million but each booklet works out at less than p for each household which receives it <e> <s> if one considers per head of expenditure each week p per household is a very modest sum for getting the correct information across to people about how their national health service works <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always extremely difficult to make accurate comparisons when methods of financing health care and clinical practices vary so considerably and when medical costs are much higher in some countries <e> <s> it is also misleading when a number of the figures quoted are based not only on public spending but also on private sector spending <e> <s> i emphasise that what matters is the level of resources available the efficiency with which they are used and above all the outputs that are delivered <e> <s> those have risen substantially <e> <s> for example since acute in-patient services are up by per cent <e> <s> acute day cases are up by per cent <e> <s> maternity in-patient cases are up by per cent <e> <s> geriatric in-patient cases are up by per cent <e> <s> and geriatric out-patient cases are up by per cent <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot provide that information without prior notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i tend to agree with the noble lord lord mellish as is so often the case <e> <s> spending on the national health service has never been higher <e> <s> however we recognise the challenge and we shall always be running behind the opportunities for more spending <e>", "<cs> my lords my reply to that question must be that the national health service is not under-funded <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has made an important point based on his own recent experience <e> <s> therefore i take this opportunity to acknowledge the very valuable service carried out by the employees that is the doctors the nurses and the many others involved of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to be able to acknowledge the individual contributions made by many people in this area <e> <s> at the same time i take the opportunity to acknowledge the fact that many people have more money available to give in this way as a result of the governments excellent economic policies <e>", "<cs> my lords we wholeheartedly agree with the views of the noble lord that is why we are aiming to improve the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that courtesy and convention have prevailed on this occasion <e> <s> i wish to say immediately that without doubt the changes will get under way next april as my right honourable friend the prime minister said and as i said on monday <e> <s> the policy has not changed only the timetable <e> <s> without doubt there is a recognised need to reduce the burden on local and health authorities both of which have a substantial programme for as the statement maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to answer my noble friends question and to confirm that the government are behaving sensibly and responsibly in making this phased and measured implementation <e> <s> i am not surprised that my noble friend thought that the noble lord lord ennals was against some of the amendments as the noble lord introduced an <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said previously there is nothing to stop those authorities that are well advanced from going ahead with plans assessment and any other developments to improve community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to hear my noble friend taking a constructive and positive attitude to the statement and rightly focusing on the specific grant for mental illness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that the draft guidance is out and it is planned that on schedule the consultation process will take place so that final guidance will be issued in the autumn <e> <s> those local authorities which are prepared or intend to carry on in advance of the timetable which is quite permissible will be able to do so in accordance with the guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the three questions that the noble baroness specifically directed at me by saying no no and no <e> <s> in regard to her questions on the rate support grant i regret that she will have to wait for the statement expected shortly from my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the statement said the government recognize that local authorities will need adequate resources <e> <s> i confirm to my noble friend that local authorities can go forward with all parts of the bill if they are able to including respite care <e> <s> indeed in some areas such care is already available <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are determined to do everything necessary to prevent the spread of hiv infection <e> <s> in that regard one important focus of our efforts must be the education of young people about the risks of infection <e> <s> education material has been produced by the department of education and science and the health education authority for use in secondary schools in the context of wider teaching about personal and social responsibility <e> <s> your lordships will remember the efforts made in this house on the education no <e> <s> act in this respect <e> <s> in addition we have asked health authorities to pay particular attention to the local needs of young people in devising programmes of hiv prevention <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful in answering the noble lords query if i tell him that we are placing in the library copies of the <e>", "<cs> my lords there may indeed be a precise reason for this difference <e> <s> however i am not in a position at present to be able to respond to the noble lord with that sort of precision <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the noble lord lord leatherland asks a difficult question <e> <s> we know of people who have been infected with hiv through normal heterosexual intercourse <e> <s> we also know of about people who have been infected as a result of intravenous drug misuse haemophiliacs and others who have been affected by infected blood products <e> <s> that is as far as i can go at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of important and useful local initiatives some of which take place in london <e> <s> the education programme to which i referred in response to the question on the order paper is a national programme for schools <e> <s> the health education authoritys programme is a national one <e> <s> we are making every effort to ensure that when any local initiatives prove useful information about them will be disseminated so that they can be used in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is as usual right <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i realise that there is some difficulty in that the figures that i quoted in answer to the question on the order paper relate to the number infected as of this moment whereas the figures i quoted in answer to the noble lord lord leatherland obviously have to be subtracted from the total figure <e> <s> i shall try to arrange for the appropriately extracted figures to be made available to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the noble lords last point regarding funding for future years as obviously these figures are revised on an annual basis <e> <s> however i accept the first point he made about the intention to help non-sighted people <e> <s> nevertheless i must point out that the grant to the royal national institute for the blind is paid under the section general scheme of grants <e> <s> that is a cash-limited budget for which the total available funding in is million which incidentally is the same amount as the rnib receives as net voluntary income <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that if the grant awarded in had been maintained at that level to date it would be worth at this years prices <e> <s> however i should point out that it is not our policy to revalue grant automatically in line with inflation <e> <s> the main criterion used in determining grant level is whether the financial circumstances of the organisation concerned may be regarded as justifying the need for central government support <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed my right honourable friend the minister for social security and the disabled has initiated discussions between his officials and the rnib about producing social security information in braille at an agreed cost to be met from funds from the department of social security <e> <s> the institute had a similar contractual arrangement with the department of the environment to produce community charge leaflets in braille and has recently succeeded in attracting sponsorship from british telecom for the production of telephone bills in braille <e>", "<cs> my lords the grant to the royal national institute for the blind is as i understand it the twelfth largest grant in the scheme <e> <s> as i have already pointed out the has not been pocketed by anyone indeed it is actually going to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that some of that work is done in some of her majestys prisons <e> <s> i shall explore further what the future of that work is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have acknowledged the valuable work done by the rnib <e> <s> i have pointed out that the saving in funding will be used for the blind and that there are many demands on that source of funding from many worthwhile organisations <e> <s> on the question of educational needs of course local education authorities are responsible for providing resources for special materials including braille textbooks for children with special needs <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered the funding arrangements seriously <e> <s> we consider seriously all applications we receive for section funding <e> <s> if the noble lord were in my place now he would realise what a difficult task it is <e> <s> we do our best in the circumstances <e> <s> reverting to the earlier part of <e>", "<cs> my lords the more people who are involved in and aware of the problems faced by those who are visually impaired and the more sources of help that can be offered the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that i was refusing to answer any of the noble lords questions <e> <s> i am always delighted to try to answer his questions <e>", "<cs> my lords not only is there hope but there has been an enormous increase in day care cases <e> <s> the numbers are currently per cent <e> <s> higher than in september and are considerably higher than when we came into office in <e> <s> that is due in part to new techniques and new technology <e> <s> so far as concerns the specific information which the noble lord requested we shall shortly be publishing a book of waiting-list information by district and specialty <e> <s> the details of the different types of cases on waiting lists may be of interest to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has made an important point <e> <s> what matters is indeed the increase in the number of patients being treated <e> <s> in approximately million in-patients were treated which is per cent <e> <s> more than in <e> <s> as i have already said the number of day cases has increased by per cent <e> <s> over the same period <e> <s> i believe that those figures represent real advances in all forms of care <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the pleasure of seeing the letter to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> extra money has gone into the health service since this government came into office in considerable amounts <e> <s> we have recognised that there is a problem regarding waiting lists and a need for a review <e> <s> that review has led to the reforms with which many of your lordships will be familiar <e> <s> the national health service reforms put issues of quality such as waiting lists at the top of the management agenda and provide incentives for improving them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for pointing out that the waiting-list initiative has been very much appreciated <e> <s> indeed it has had considerable success <e> <s> one specific region the mersey region has been particularly successful in reducing its longest wait patients <e> <s> it is the first region to have no patient waiting longer than two years on a waiting list <e> <s> it is our aim by march to have no one anywhere waiting for over two years <e> <s> however the mersey success shows what can be achieved through good management <e> <s> we congratulate the chairman and officers of the regional health authority and those responsible for the other health authorities who are having considerable success in this field <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we plan to continue the waiting-list initiative and health authorities that have already used the waiting-list fund to experiment with a variety of initiatives will continue <e> <s> the reforms that we are introducing through the national health service and community care act will allow further developments along those lines to enable waiting-list patients to be treated more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any figures or information on that point but if the noble baroness wishes to pursue the matter i shall be very happy to answer her on another occasion should she choose to table a question <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons for the national health service reforms to which i referred are to improve the efficiency of the service and to ensure that quality issues such as waiting lists are at the top of the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his kind offer to produce a copy of the letter referred to <e> <s> i agree with him on the importance of the waiting time as opposed to the total numbers on the waiting list <e> <s> i shall look into the question of how the statistics are presented in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier one of the reasons why waiting lists are longer is that more people than ever before are being treated <e> <s> inevitably the waiting lists have responded to that situation <e> <s> i take this opportunity to mention in response to the noble countess that the figures which have been quoted for total numbers include a number of self-deferred people that is to say people who simply do not turn up for their appointments and day cases for which statistics were not collected before <e> <s> in a sense that distorts the total figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider that the noble lord has received a reply from me to his question <e> <s> the fact that we do not have the information available must be the most appropriate reply in the circumstances <e> <s> with regard to his other point of course it is important to the person on the waiting list at what time he has his operation <e> <s> it is also very important to all those other people who have received treatment over the past years as a result of the increased activity and the increasing numbers of people being treated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware that the noble lord and his party are keen to whip up enthusiasm against national health service trusts <e> <s> such ballots as have been held nearly all ask different questions and apply to different constituencies <e> <s> we have consistently made clear that it would not be appropriate to hold ballots on applications for trust status <e> <s> such applications will include complex and detailed proposals on service management and personnel matters <e> <s> it would not be right to attempt to reduce those matters to a form which could be used as the basis of a ballot nor would it be right effectively to give any one group a power of veto over a trust application <e> <s> the secretary of state will decide whether an application for trust status should be approved on the merits of the individual application and in the light of the views of all those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is indeed an efficient and effective service that we seek <e> <s> i remind noble lords that national health service trusts will remain firmly within the national health service <e> <s> i emphasise that consultation is built into the process <e>", "<cs> my lords in preparing formal applications regions have ensured that they have been given local publicity <e> <s> they have sought the views of all those with an interest including as i said health authorities staff patients gps community health councils and the local community <e> <s> all those views will be taken into account by my right honourable friend the secretary of state when he considers the application <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> i am happy to reassure the noble baroness that those are exactly the kinds of organisation that we expect will have an input <e> <s> we have made it clear that consultations should take place over a three-month period and therefore there is time to obtain an input from all those interested <e>", "<cs> my lords the financial viability of the unit concerned will be of extreme importance <e> <s> clearly those which have made considerable progress with the resource management initiative will be in an advantageous position <e>", "<cs> yes my lords both types of hospital remain fully in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government are still working towards that aim <e> <s> this year we have made additional allocations of over million to enable the health service to increase its support for voluntary hospices <e> <s> in scotland hospices are already eligible for public funding of at least per cent <e> <s> of their running costs <e> <s> in england and northern ireland the health service has been asked to work towards a position in which its contribution matches that from voluntary giving <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i had sought to give that reassurance in answer to my noble friends question <e> <s> we are still working towards that commitment <e> <s> i do not wish to pre-empt the debate scheduled for th november <e> <s> much depends on the outcome of the current expenditure round and until that is known no final decision will be made on future funding arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the difficulties which can arise when the various health authorities are working at a different pace <e> <s> however some authorities have already achieved the per cent <e> <s> level and some are over and above that <e> <s> at this point all i can say is that we are working towards a situation in which all local health authorities will have reached the per cent <e> <s> level <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i reiterate that we have supplied an additional million this year and have given assurances that that level of funding will continue <e> <s> it is the achievement of the across-the-board level of per cent <e> <s> in all health authorities that is requiring a little more time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to respond to the noble lord lord blease in acknowledging the important role played by the hospice movement and the valuable contribution that it makes to the difficulties experienced by people who are terminally ill our whole thrust in the health service is towards improving the quality and standards of care <e> <s> to that extent i am sure that the department of health will be delighted to hear what the working party has to suggest regarding this important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on many occasions as with other funding issues the funding of hospices is the responsibility of local health authorities <e> <s> we must leave that responsibility at a decentralised level <e> <s> the precise arrangements for supporting individual projects are therefore a matter of discussion between the authorities and the organisations concerned <e> <s> in general terms we expect the authorities to use the considerable additional funds that we have made available to support voluntary projects and to top up rather than to replace the contribution that they already make <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of health has good and regular contact with those in the voluntary sector who are involved in the hospice movement <e> <s> indeed if the government have not been made aware at that level they are left in no doubt by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords without implicating myself in any undertaking regarding a timescale i am only too happy to stand by that undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords the overall funding in england and wales was million for the current year <e> <s> until we have the results of the public expenditure round i cannot say finally what will be available next year <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am happy to relay the opinions expressed in your lordships house to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord molloy had listened to his noble friend lord longford he would know that the house is due to discuss the subject on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords given our decentralised system it is for the individual health authorities concerned to determine the level of health service provision required in their areas taking account of local circumstances and resources available to them <e> <s> bed numbers are not of course an accurate indicator of levels of service in the nhs <e> <s> what matters is the number of patients treated and i am happy to say that in london that has increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the opportunity to say before and i hope that your lordships will forgive me for repeating it that spending has never been higher in the national health service <e> <s> as populations move health services must change to reflect that <e> <s> since it has been the policy of successive governments to shift resources from london to where people are now living <e> <s> this governments recently introduced reforms will make it easier for health service funding and services to adapt to that sort of change <e> <s> in future funding will reflect population and so distribution of funds will reflect population needs and not just the historical siting of buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he has given us the benefit of his particular expertise in this area <e> <s> he points to the effects of the sort of crisis management which he has seen in the national health service and which has spurred us in introducing our reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i emphasise that all the closures to which the noble lords question referred are temporary <e> <s> on the whole the figures are correct although for lewisham the noble lords figure is and i understand that it should be three and the quoted figure of for kings college should be <e> <s> the noble lord may be confusing that with dulwich in some way <e> <s> i know that the closure at st bartholomews is not for financial reasons but in order to enable the hospital to carry out a major refurbishment programme which i am sure the noble lord will agree is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords as i reminded your lordships on monday the issue of occupancy of beds is not the vital question <e> <s> the vital question is the number of people being treated <e> <s> because beds are being used more efficiently than ever before with swifter turnovers and more day surgery the number of patients has continued to rise <e> <s> therefore i do not believe the noble baroness to be justified in suggesting that there will be a crisis of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness bears out a very important point namely that all emergency situations are being dealt with immediately and any other requirements are being dealt with in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord underhill for reminding me again about his particular situation <e> <s> the riverside health authority is ensuring that steps taken to control expenditure will leave sufficient beds available certainly for the needs of emergency admissions as we have already established and other cases such as cancer cases hiv and aids cases terminations of pregnancy and selected day cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i should draw the observation of the noble lord lord mellish to the attention of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have done that in saying that those closures are all temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply answer yes to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as always in these matters the special health authority is the authority responsible for the spending of the budget <e> <s> the money being made available for this unit is from the central aids budget which is initially reserved for the use of special health authorities <e> <s> the agreement as to the amount of funding in this case has been the result of discussions between officials of the department of health and the hammersmith special health authority in response to the formal bid for funds from the special health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful to the noble lord if he could advise me which charities contributed to this purpose <e> <s> my understanding is that the funds for the capital costs of the building of the unit were essentially national health service funds <e> <s> nevertheless the principle is that in certain cases pay-beds have been allowed in national health service hospitals that has been true since the inception of the national health service <e> <s> however careful consideration is always given beforehand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is true that it is better to use facilities to earn money which can then be redistributed than to leave facilities lying idle <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the future of the gordon hospital and its day hospital is secure <e> <s> riverside health authority is committed to the hospital and is considering ways in which more specialised services can be brought onto the site to supplement the core mental health services already provided there <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> there has been a temporary closure of beds at the gordon hospital <e> <s> that is part of a range of measures that the health authority is putting into effect to ensure that levels of expenditure are contained within revenue allocation <e> <s> the industrial therapy unit which was moved to the gordon hospital on a temporary basis following the closure of banstead hospital to which the noble lord referred can best fulfil its function in a community setting <e> <s> the district is exploring the possibility of relocating into the community and a working group has been established to consider that position <e> <s> in all those matters i understand that members of staff in the unit have been consulted and have agreed to the general strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that since the proposal to make some closures was agreed it has been possible to limit closures to a net reduction of only nine beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that there has been considerable activity within the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carter for his participation in this second reading debate <e> <s> on the point that he raised about the community charge i can give a firm assurance that there is no cause for concern on that score <e> <s> with or without the bill there is no lawful authority for passing to community charge
