["<cs> my lords on behalf of the lord chairman i beg leave to move the second motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the opportunity of airing the differences between my view and that of the subcommittee of the noble lord lord aberdare in the offices committee last week and i do not intend to go over the same ground today <e> <s> however there is one comment i should like to make on the final paragraphs of section of the report <e> <s> i am sure it is desirable to keep in step if we possibly can with the house of commons <e> <s> a joint approach if it can be contrived is i am sure the better solution and not least for the members of the european parliament <e> <s> but all that depends on the willingness of the house of commons to move positively in the desired direction and to move soon because our whole relationship with the members of the european <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask your lordships kind indulgence in making my maiden speech <e> <s> i am indeed grateful to the noble lord lord kings norton for giving me this opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my words of thanks to the noble lord lord caradon for raising this important subject <e> <s> it is indeed most important and not the least so because the law of the sea treaty sets out to regulate the development of the vast mineral resources which are known to exist on the floor of the ocean <e> <s> the noble lord lord caradon has spoken eloquently that these should become a common heritage and who can deny that hope and aspiration <e> <s> but i fear that the clauses of the law of the sea treaty as currently drafted will effectively deny these resources <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks to my noble friend lord lauderdale for initiating this wide-ranging debate on industry with a particular application to energy <e> <s> i also listened with great interest to the noble lord lord kearton i have had the pleasure of sitting on his committee when preparing the report on the european community coal policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to those of other noble lords to the noble lord lord walston for initiating this debate which seems to me to be both timely and of real importance <e> <s> the public support for ethiopia is amazing <e> <s> indeed it is so amazing that some of the recipients are concerned that there may be so much tied aid to ethiopia that the other countries which are emerging on the horizon in equal trouble will find difficulty in obtaining the support needed <e> <s> i do not share that view <e> <s> i think it will be there <e> <s> but i should like to address my few remarks to the longer-term problem <e> <s> the need is surely to overcome the cause of the famines and to do that to increase the food production of the countries where these dangers arise <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the rigidity between the wholesale and direct sales quota is harmful to british producers notably cheese makers <e>", "<cs> the national bus company has two very good pension schemes and i think it is common ground in the committee that the members should enjoy those schemes <e> <s> the problem with which the government have to deal is that they are both fully related to the retail price index <e> <s> this inevitably leads to the uncertainties to which the noble lord <e> <s> lord barnett referred in achieving some completely insured scheme for the future <e> <s> the companies are undertaking to fund these schemes in one case up to and in the other case to but these schemes can clearly fall under the terms of the bill before your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> i believe we are all agreed that the national bus company has a fine pension plan and that a means must be found for people to enjoy it <e> <s> the question is how <e> <s> at the committee stage in july the possibility of insurance was discussed <e> <s> at that time there was no assurance that such could be achieved bearing in mind the escalations which are built into the plan <e> <s> however the government have now produced a plan which in their opinion and in the opinion of the government actuary is equivalent to the specific and complicated terms of the two plans that we are at present discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord butterworth for his penetrating speech which i am sure we shall all remember <e> <s> perhaps i may also add my thanks to lord kings norton not only for his speech which surveyed the whole area of esprit but for the admirable way in which he chaired the committee on which i had the honour to serve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am another west country peer supporting the southern route <e> <s> in doing so i propose to speak and very briefly to the substance rather than the procedures of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my word of thanks for the able chairmanship of my noble friend lord torrington of sub-committee f of which i was a member <e> <s> i should like to say a few words in a brief intervention on the economic importance of nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the project i should like to declare an interest <e> <s> i am a director of george wimpey which are one of the original participants in this venture and hope to be one of the contractors building the tunnel <e> <s> my views cannot better be expressed than the conclusion of the railways which is that the channel tunnel project is the single biggest opportunity in the post-war period <e> <s> i am convinced that it will increase trade <e> <s> there will be speed and efficiency which will lead to more trade <e> <s> it will provide an important facility for passengers and the tourist trade is one of our most important invisible exports <e> <s> comments have been made on environmental issues <e> <s> my only comment is that after hearing many words in this house and elsewhere i am impressed that so great a project can involve so little disruption of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my words of congratulation to the noble lord lord wyatt for his lucid and witty speech all the more acceptable to me because unlike the noble lord lord jenkins i agreed with it <e> <s> perhaps i may comment briefly on some objections to the conclusions of the layfield report in particular events which have arisen subsequent to the dates of the investigation <e> <s> it is true that the price of oil has fallen sharply <e> <s> i do not believe that it has fallen sharply enough to make oil stations economic but this is surely not the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my word of thanks to my noble friend lord lauderdale for initiating this debate <e> <s> it is an immensely important subject with a picture which is continually changing <e>", "<cs> my lords the select committee of which i had the honour to be chairman reported on th may having as the noble lord lord congleton has just said taken evidence for days <e> <s> it concluded that the outer route is the right route for the bypass and that therefore the bill should be allowed to proceed <e> <s> we found the questions very hard to decide but considered that the issues could not have been presented with greater fairness and clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i comment on that point <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said paragraph was part of the case put forward by the petitioners <e> <s> the committees conclusions start on the opposite page <e> <s> the committee concluded that routes and a were not a satisfactory solution to the problem <e> <s> if they were not satisfactory solutions it does not matter whether or not they need legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the countrys power requirements are to be met at least eight new power stations nuclear or coal are required by the end of the century <e> <s> planning permission for only one has been obtained so far sizewell b <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord beloff for initiating a topical and important debate <e> <s> conforming with other speakers i shall try to keep to the narrow path and not touch on privatisation as a framework for the future attractive as that might be <e> <s> i can talk briefly about the present plans for increased generating capacity which is so necessary if the security of power of which the noble lord lord ezra spoke is to be achieved <e> <s> those plans are cegb plans <e> <s> as far as i can see they have been adopted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment briefly on the work of the select committee <e> <s> there were only six petitions all of which dealt with matters of disturbance either in the river or on the approach roads <e> <s> of those five commercial petitions were withdrawn before the committee concluded its proceedings leaving one petition related to residential disturbance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start with an apology <e> <s> i have a long standing engagement in the west country and i may not therefore be able to stay to the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my thanks to my noble friend lord renwick for so fully and admirably dealing with the whole scope of this long complicated and most interesting report <e> <s> for my part i should like to speak briefly on the part that alternative sources of energy may play in the current and vital programme of increased generating capacity in england and wales <e> <s> some reference has already been made to the programme which started at kw and i understand has risen to kw <e> <s> my noble friend lord lauderdale in his important speech on tuesday referred to this and to the delays that are occurring <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon made further reference to it today <e> <s> of this great programme non-fossil fuels are to make up per cent <e> <s> under the governments policy <e> <s> this means that of new construction a much higher percentage will have to use non-fossil fuels because the total includes phasing out the magnox sections with about mw of capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say what allowance for improved energy efficiency has been assumed in the government requirement for gigawatts of additional generating capacity by the end of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to the minister for dealing so clearly with this most complicated bill <e> <s> i cannot say that i agree with all of the bill but i start with some brief comments on the non-fossil fuel policy with which i fully agree <e> <s> it seems to me that this is wholly <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord lauderdale has already said that supply is basic to the requirements of the bill <e> <s> i entirely agree that the secretary of state cannot be made solely responsible for the continuity of supply <e> <s> that initially must rest with the area companies which will contract with generating companies to supply power <e> <s> however i ask the minister what will happen if for reasons of finance or otherwise the area companies are unable to secure from privately owned generating companies the power that they require <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> it has never seemed to me to be logical that the import of power should be part of the nuclear component <e> <s> the present contract is a topping up contract <e> <s> it can be terminated at very short notice i believe two hours and that is not generating capacity <e> <s> we do not know or at least i do not know what will be the means of entering into contracts in the future <e> <s> the cegb will cease to exist and it may <e>", "<cs> i do not think the amendment conflicts with any european legislation present or future <e> <s> there is nothing in the amendment to stop the import of power from france <e> <s> the amendment merely states that those imports will not be part of the quota of non-fossil fuel generation <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment without necessarily supporting the solution to the amendment <e> <s> this is a very obscure area <e> <s> the government must give us more information as to <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the amendment is practicable <e> <s> however it suggests another area on which clarification might be given <e> <s> we are given to understand that the cegb has made very large provision against the risks which are foreseen for the future <e> <s> a provision is an accounting term <e> <s> i suspect that it is not cash but it probably has the effect of reducing the book value of the assets which at a point in time are to be sold to the public <e> <s> it would be interesting to know whether the government intend to take that into account in the price at which the generating companies are sold to the public which would be reasonable <e> <s> in future that must necessarily apply to all the stations in the pwr programme because as the minister has just stated none of them will be open before the bill becomes law <e> <s> perhaps the minister could clarify an interesting problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendment is unnecessary and complicated <e> <s> it relates the fossil fuel capacity to the security of supply but the security of supply will be met by numerous forms of generation notably coal for the foreseeable future <e> <s> moreover the amount required for security is a matter of opinion <e> <s> in the past although it has been estimated to the best of our ability the estimates have not been very accurate <e> <s> my noble friend lord nelson may recall the period in the s when it was decided to build two nuclear stations a year <e> <s> the estimations were wrong <e> <s> that was reduced to one and then it was reduced to none to the great inconvenience of the plant manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment is unnecessary and could conceivably be harmful <e> <s> as the noble lord lord shepherd said a report is pending <e> <s> it is being funded partly by government partly by the cegb and partly by private interests one of which is george wimpey ltd of which i am a director and therefore declare an interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to restrict my remarks to the problem of the ownership of the grid company to which my noble friend lord peyton and the noble lord lord ezra have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that the minister has given are somewhat confusing <e> <s> we have heard before and during the debate of the very large provision made by the cegb <e> <s> the figures that the minister has now given are shown to be very large indeed <e> <s> i assume that this must necessarily be provision out of revenue <e> <s> it follows therefore that the consumer pays <e> <s> i assume that the provision has been re-invested in the business and does not have a corresponding cash availability to meet the costs when they arise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend the leader of the house whether the government intend to keep the allocation of fossil fuel stations as planned <e> <s> if that is so the size of national power will be materially reduced because it will no longer have the nuclear stations <e> <s> that would perhaps be helpful to the competition which the government intend to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a word to the motion so ably moved by my noble friend lord jenkin <e> <s> he has described the railway and its purpose <e> <s> i need say only one or two words amplifying the report <e> <s> i had the honour to be chairman of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the best way that i can thank the noble lord lord underhill for initiating the debate is to say how much i agree with him in the importance that he attaches to the channel tunnel and to the rail links associated with it <e> <s> in that i fear that i disagree with the noble lord lord jay <e>"]
