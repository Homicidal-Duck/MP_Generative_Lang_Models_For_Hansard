either born in hong kong or acquired united kingdom citizenship through naturalisation <e> <s> but of those numbers very few have been able to come here owing to the commonwealth immigration acts of and and the immigration act <e> <s> it is stated that these three acts have gradually eroded the right of hong kong citizens to come to the united kingdom <e> <s> at the present time i understand that the number coming from hong kong to the united kingdom to work each year under the special quota system for dependent territories is restricted to so we cannot say that we are dealing with vast numbers <e> <s> last year only people entered the united kingdom from hong kong with work permits and they mainly work in the restaurant trade <e> <s> another dependants that is children and some ageing parents entered the united kingdom under existing immigration provisions <e> <s> the total number from hong kong coming to the united kingdom who have a chance to settle here therefore is less than a thousand a year so i do think that the figure has been greatly exaggerated <e> <s> also they will have something that no other dependent territory will have they will have a life peer sitting in this house <e> <s> he will be able to put forward the opinions of hong kong and he will be able to see that they are fairly treated <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i think that my noble friend has mistaken what i said <e> <s> i said they would have representation through a life peer in this house so they will have some representation and he can look after their welfare and i am sure he will do

has he been consulted and will he be consulted about the details <e> <s> the suggestion on page regarding trains terminating at exeter will be disastrous to the tourist trade and it will also make difficulties for the servicemen and women returning to plymouth and devonport <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be my habit now to speak after the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and as usual i cannot agree with all that he says <e> <s> in particular i cannot agree that any man wasted his life if he was serving his country in the army navy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend be kind enough to tell me whether the farms of the ministry of defence and their buildings are included in this <e>", "<cs> my lords with all the experts to whom i have listened my speech will be very short <e> <s> i should like to say a word of appreciation to my noble friend lord bellwin because i am very pleased with clause <e> <s> i do not agree with what my noble friend lord montgomery said about that <e> <s> one aspect that we have neglected overseas for instance in the colonies when they were colonies was to put in water facilities <e> <s> we must have a much bigger drive to get water facilities put into these countries <e> <s> health and happiness depends greatly on this <e> <s> the more we can do to augment the water service the better <e> <s> i should like to see people trained in their own country so that they know the character of their country rather than coming over here and being trained <e> <s> it is absolutely essential to know your territory when putting in water facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords it also mentions orders in the bill though i should not like to contradict the noble baroness because she is much more knowledgeable about the subject than i am <e> <s> if there are going to be guidelines we shall have to watch them <e> <s> if we are never going to see the guidelines that will make the situation even worse than having statutory instruments which we can debate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for his statement <e> <s> i should like to do so today as <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i should like to say just a few words of thanks to the noble lord lord elton and his officials for redrafting the bill over which they have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in this debate because i am chairman of a new organisation called cued speech and like the right reverend prelate i am in desperate need of money to keep it going <e> <s> it is the newest method from america and it is working very well having been going for two or three years but we are existing from month to month <e> <s> i did even more than the right reverend prelate about seeing the minister from another place <e> <s> i even had him to lunch but unfortunately that was wasted money because we have heard nothing and that was nearly a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to apologise to the minister for what i am going to say because he was kind enough to come down and see my housing association and we are grateful to him for spending the time in doing so <e> <s> i want to put a few points forward <e> <s> the project i wish to speak about is the <e>", "<cs> first of all i should like to thank the noble lord lord kennet for introducing this bill <e> <s> it will teach us a geat deal <e> <s> i should especially like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his expert opinion at the beginning <e> <s> he put our minds a great deal to rest about the state of the law <e> <s> we shall have to discuss this more <e> <s> what he said will also be a warning to the medical and legal professions about what are the rights at the present time <e> <s> it may help us tremendously in getting the bill if we have it correct <e> <s> anyhow it will awaken people particularly in the medical and legal professions to what is the present situation <e> <s> i should like to offer the noble and learned lord my sincere thanks for coming in at the very beginning and giving us a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say to my noble friend who opened the debate today that after leading the house so well i wish her equal success in her new role <e> <s> there is so much to be done for the world as a whole by her department <e> <s> many people need help <e> <s> many are dying of starvation and many live in daily fear of local wars <e> <s> in particular i think that the chores of some women could be looked into by the department and i am thinking of the women who have to walk miles and miles to get water and who have to carry the pots on their heads <e> <s> there is nothing worse than seeing these women who age very quickly having to do this <e> <s> if only we could install a few pumps it would be a great help <e> <s> i am delighted we have a woman in the foreign office <e> <s> women are very good at looking at more detailed matters <e> <s> also of course women have to be diplomats particularly married women otherwise their marriages would not be a success <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble and gallant lord lord lewin <e> <s> having been to the falklands i know how much he was respected on all sides civilian army navy and <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord dean of beswick for his maiden speech <e> <s> regrettably i was not in the other place at the same time as he was but i shall have the pleasure of catching up on him here <e> <s> i should also like <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be allowed to say a few words particularly to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i have been in both houses with him and i have always found his explanation of bills to be thorough and excellent <e> <s> when we have legal matters to discuss he gives great heart to people such as myself who are not legally trained <e> <s> his patience and the clarity with which he puts things forward are quite amazing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she will consider this again <e> <s> the noel-baker family have given great service to greece in the past <e> <s> i have personally stayed on the estate and have seen the work that they have done on the estate and with the villages <e> <s> i think a little word from her might stop the harassment that they are receiving at the present moment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he heard the early morning broadcast which said that mr mugabe and the prime minister had had a very agreeable discussion which would make a great difference to their friendship in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord seebohm <e> <s> for not only chairing the committee and this report <e> <s> but for the very courteous way he did it always giving members of the committee a chance to have their word which is not always done in committee proceedings <e> <s> it is interesting to note that britain and italy are the top receivers of money and our million is divided as follows million for training as job-creation schemes for the under s million to train adults in assisted areas and million for training handicapped people <e> <s> the method of applying for grants takes too long <e> <s> i shall not go into details which have already been clearly expressed <e> <s> however having to go through two channels takes anything from six to seven months and sometimes months to achieve results <e> <s> it was strange to read in reports of the communitys court of auditors and the european commission that in certain countries approved projects are delayed <e> <s> or the countries never take up their money <e> <s> the result is that <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he say whether he will take action to chase up the million which has been under-spent <e> <s> surely people should look into why the money has not been spent and see what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the greater london fund for blood transfusion and this concerns liquid blood may i ask my noble friend to make it quite clear that the money is not for the blood but is purely for the costs of administration <e> <s> we have recently had a very helpful development by way of getting off vat so the charges will not be quite so high <e> <s> instead of charging every individual person for this administration we should like to have a yearly grant which i think would be a much better way of running it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i feel rather nervous about contributing to this debate when we have so many experts here with their great knowledge <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord buxton and in particular his family for the work they have done over many many years to put these islands on the map <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord shackleton because he has done the same <e> <s> i think that the falklands might probably have been unknown if it had not been for their help <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i congratulate the noble earl lord attlee <e> <s> he is not in his place at the moment and that is quite understandable but i once had the pleasure of being taken to the zoo by his father and spent a very pleasant afternoon <e> <s> i do not suppose the noble earl remembers now but i had the chance of meeting him as well <e> <s> i think that he made a very fine speech today <e> <s> i should also like to pay a tribute to the late lord amulree <e> <s> he and i together went to europe to rescue civilian prisoners of war <e> <s> he did a magnificent job there as well as in connection with one of his voluntary <e>", "<cs> my lords recently i ordered some peat for my garden and was astonished to find that it came from moscow <e> <s> would it not be better if it came from northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i should just like to ask two points why do we have to leave out registered medical practitioners <e> <s> secondly why are we not mentioning national health hospitals and registered nursing homes <e> <s> i think that it would be very helpful to have both of those put back into the bill because i think it is essential that we use these two services <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate my noble friend lord broxbourne on a very interesting and excellent speech of the calibre we were all accustomed to hearing in the other house <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will feel younger by coming to this house and i hope that it will give him a new lease of life <e> <s> we can do with his words of wisdom in future debates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether in view of the growing importance of foreign languages there has been an increase in the number of such teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether she realises that overseas governments have to make plans for their students several years ahead <e> <s> therefore it is essential for them to know as soon as possible what facilities are available <e> <s> will my noble friend take particular interest in the smaller territories which are in need of greater help <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> can he tell me how many of the tenants are required to maintain their farm buildings especially those which are scheduled <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for that reply but i am not at all satisfied with it because i do not think that it will help the tenant in any way <e> <s> i think that we are all worried in this committee about the tenants themselves what advice they will get and how they will get the most out of this bill <e> <s> they need something that will make them feel reassured that they are not being done out of something that they think will now become their right <e> <s> there is an alternative that could be thought of and that is to have a legal duty upon the local authority and the environmental health officers to investigate complaints from council tenants and to submit reports to the responsible council committee charging them to ensure that remedial works are carried out <e> <s> that might be a safeguard <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply which i do not think is a very satisfactory one <e> <s> i will now withdraw my amendment and hope to discuss it in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the royal ordnance factories and the naval dockyards are to come under this review <e> <s> i ask that because there is considerable anxiety now about their future role and especially over the closing of chatham dockyard so that they really do not know at the moment what jobs they have to do in each dockyard <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether there are about million people with hearing defects and confirm that that wonderful woman helen keller stated that blindness cuts you off from things but deafness cuts you off from people <e> <s> would he agree that we really do want people to be able to play their part naturally <e> <s> therefore may i ask him as the population is getting older whether this matter can be speeded up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate my noble friend lady carnegy of lour on her excellent speech and for raising this topic at all <e> <s> as all the noble baronesses have congratulated my noble friend lord forte i should like to do so too <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he said exterior <e> <s> he did not mention interior as i understand it <e> <s> it is the interior ones that i am particularly worried about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not happy about my noble friends reply <e> <s> i thank the opposition for the kind way in which they have helped but i think i shall withdraw the amendment since i do not see any other possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord bottomley not only on his maiden speech but also on the splendid service that he has given to the other house and now to this house and to the government of the country as a whole <e> <s> i recall that as commonwealth secretary the noble lord was very much liked in all the different countries and that he and i had several jaunts together on business of course <e> <s> we have tried to work hard for the commonwealth parliamentary association ever since <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can she give me a breakdown between men and women in the new blood section and also in the information technology section <e> <s> will she try to get more students for these two courses <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the minister whether or not in view of the fact that belize is really under-populated there is a chance of getting these people some work while they are in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords having had the opportunity to see this hospital during my visit to the falkland islands i should like to praise all those who have worked there together in the past military and civil in the care of the patients <e> <s> our one regret is that the old people were still there <e> <s> it had been hoped that there would be an abbeyfield organisation or something similar to which they could turn <e> <s> perhaps now that the hospital has had this unfortunate accident we shall make progress there

another happy hospital will be built up <e> <s> as this one has been in the past <e> <s> it has done extremely good work and carried out major operations <e> <s> more modern equipment will be very useful <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend why are members of the house of commons allowed to have a pinch of snuff any time they like <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he will be kind enough to consider turning some of these homes into flats which could be rented by nurses who want to live their individual lives after working their shifts <e> <s> also such flats would be very convenient for them since when they have to go home on dark nights they sometimes need protection especially in certain areas in london <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking in this debate today i should like first to remember that today is the th june which is the second anniversary of the british forces victory in the falklands <e> <s> i read in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord state whether there have been any significant changes in the numbers of those waiting for treatment as in-patients in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble minister for that reply may i ask whether he can say what the governments present policy in regard to this is and whether they plan any changes for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for putting down this motion because i particularly want to discuss the question of foreign languages in education <e> <s> i have recently been fortified by three letters in <e>", "<cs> my lords my reason for joining in this debate is that during the last war i was working in the ministry of supply and one of my jobs was to go round these factories both day and night to see the work particularly among the women and young girls who were probably working in industry for the first time in their lives <e> <s> they did a magnificent job <e> <s> they were always keen and they worked hard and although in some cases they had to be kept in for security reasons they never grumbled <e> <s> at one of them the largest that i visited it was fortunate for them that a gi camp came into the district so restrictions were lifted and they were able to have a better time <e>", "<cs> may i refer to what the noble baroness lady wootton said <e> <s> if what my noble friend the minister said takes place outside harrods surely a crowd would gather in no time <e> <s> i would much sooner go to the police station straight away and have the thing done quietly there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> my reason is rather a different one <e> <s> i am connected with a hospital in which some people have been staying for up to years <e> <s> now it is found with modern drugs and so on <e> <s> that they can leave hospital and live in the community <e> <s> we have over people in the community at the present time and there may be even more as far as i know <e> <s> but it is essential that they should be given support and of course the social workers are the people who can give them the best support <e> <s> the other thing that is essential is that a lot of them have to take drugs at certain times on certain days <e> <s> that must be safeguarded if we want to keep them in the community <e> <s> so i do feel very strongly that we must have the help and support that can be given only by the social workers in this connection and therefore i wish to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to my noble friend that i am not very pleased with that reply especially as the number of bands has been cut from to since the war <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that in war the bandsmen are very efficient especially in casualty help and that this was shown in the recent falklands campaign <e> <s> furthermore the intimate relationship between the royal marines and the commandos in their training is very beneficial to them both <e> <s> they are also a powerful recruiting agent and a tourist attraction <e> <s> finally may i say that the plymouth band which is the oldest being years old has given very good service to the country and also has now received the freedom of the city of plymouth <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend the minister has been quite sympathetic in his reply i should like to ask him whether it will be possible to see these revised articles of association by report stage <e>", "<cs> in view of that i think i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> following what the noble lord lord diamond has said i beg leave to withdraw this amendment and hope to discuss it again at report stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask two questions if i may <e> <s> as these factories were under the crown they did not have the application of the health and safety at work act and also factory inspectors were not allowed to visit them <e> <s> i should like to know whether these two provisions will be changed <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble minister for the trouble he has taken over answering all our amendments <e> <s> he has had a very long and tiring session on this and i should like to suggest that we have plenty of time now to think out new amendments <e> <s> perhaps we shall be more successful in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord the minister for that reply may i ask him whether he knows that every day in the united kingdom there are five cot deaths <e> <s> the babies die suddenly silently and unexpectedly with no known reason <e> <s> intensive research into the causes of cot deaths and the prevention of them is being carried out by an organisation which is funded by the foundation for the study of infant deaths <e> <s> it is an independent and voluntary organisation <e> <s> we should like the minister to encourage the health authorities to collaborate with this fund in its research to help identify children at risk and to provide extra primary health care to those at greatest risk <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for that reply <e> <s> if these regulations are not satisfactory will he consider bringing in some legislation to deal with this problem because so many people have recently been killed in gas accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not put this amendment to the vote because obviously i would lose it but i shall reserve my right to raise the matter again at the final stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i am not very happy about that reply <e> <s> the minister has said that he will answer questions and i hope that when we put down questions either written or oral they will be answered quickly and we shall be given some definite information as to what will happen in the future <e> <s> if that is so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i offer my congratulations to my noble friend lord young of graffham <e> <s> i hope that he has brought a magic wand with him because that is very much what this subject needs <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord seebohm for the very kind way in which he always runs the committee and also for helping with the report <e> <s> i should like to thank the clerks and the advisers who have produced this very remarkable report <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say only a few words <e> <s> i had down two amendments concerning this proposition in committee and at report stage

<e> <s> we have a rough idea but we do not know <e> <s> i really think it is essential to receive reports from the ministry and i should like to suggest that if we cannot get this amendment through we put down unstarred questions from time to time in order to get the information we require <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to be able to follow the noble lord lord greenhill with his expert knowledge <e> <s> unfortunately i have not been to the island but i have visited the islands near it and i should like to put forward some views <e> <s> i also thank my noble friend lord buxton for bringing forward this debate today and also for his excellent film <e> <s> when we consider ethiopia we know what effect films can have on problems when shown on television <e> <s> i hope his film will also

am delighted that he has been able to keep his post now as the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords when voting took place in members of the services were given days i think between the allocation of their votes and the date when the votes had to be in <e> <s> will there again be a period of time for that to happen and will there be notice of where the applications for votes are to be sent <e>", "<cs>

friend say whether there are any local authorities in this country which are undertaking projects similar to those that have been so successful in new york <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady jeger for two reasons first for having initiated this debate we have learned a great deal more about the services concerned and secondly for the work that she did for the elizabeth garrett anderson hospital <e> <s> that was a very great gem in her crown <e> <s> it was going to be closed and i remember the work that she did the money which the government kindly gave and

like to join in this debate as i did in the previous debate and i would thank my noble friend the minister for the very useful information that she has given <e> <s> i should like to ask about

put <e> <s> perhaps i may first thank the noble lord lord shackleton for so kindly referring to me and also for introducing this debate <e> <s> he is the expert on this subject in this house and we were very pleased to hear what he had to say <e> <s> i was also glad to hear the noble lord lord kennet because although he sometimes takes a different view from me he has been to argentina as well

others he has tabled to improve the drafting of this bill <e> <s> we must all seek to make the law as plain and clear as possible and i know that his amendments are proposed in that spirit <e> <s> i also know that the phrase got out of or off has been criticised by some as being awkward and cumbersome <e> <s> i am afraid however that the neat suggestion in the noble lords amendment would sacrifice clarity and the proper working of the bill for the need of a simpler phrase <e> <s> that cannot be right <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for very long on this matter but i think it right that we acknowledge our agreement on all sides of the house that clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> the clause is aimed at frightening sexual behaviour towards women <e> <s> as such few of us deny that it may well gain a place in criminal law in due course <e> <s> however the offence created in clause is not one aimed primarily at controlling the nuisance in the street caused by the plying of the prostitution trade <e> <s> it involves wider issues and indeed in some senses very important issues <e> <s> it is an area in which moral judgments on what is appropriate behaviour between men and women whether in public or in private have been made <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for the detailed drafting proposals <e> <s> i think we agree and there is nothing between us on the sense or substance of clause <e> <s> it is simply a matter of grammatical preference <e> <s> i am content to leave the drafting of bills to lawyers and for them to decide that clause is right as it stands and follows the precedent of section of the sexual offences act of <e> <s> i do not see anything wrong about what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> however as we know what we have in clause now has worked without difficulty for a long time in earlier legislation on such sexual offences <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will agree that we may hold to that but that

denning <e> <s> he has taken a tremendous interest in this bill and has spared time to take part in the discussions on two occasions <e> <s> i should like to thank him most <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i must congratulate the noble lord lord kilbracken on his efforts to make the bill more elegant and once again i am sorry that i cannot commend the amendments to the house because something of substance will be lost <e> <s> as the noble lord will know i hope to persuade your lordships to leave clause out of the bill altogether as it now serves no useful purpose <e> <s> but in any event i am happy to discuss the drafting point on its merits and explain why the new clause sticks to the original if somewhat awkward phrasing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that <e> <s> i should have been quicker on my feet <e> <s> i am very pleased to have tabled this new clause in place of clauses i and because i believe it represents the best of the many helpful suggestions and comments made by your lordships today and in committee <e> <s> the objective has been to safeguard the innocent most carefully while addressing the real mischief caused by kerb crawling in an effective way and tackling the nuisance at its root <e> <s> under this clause as before any persistent soliciting for the purpose of prostitution is prohibited <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon and would like to accept his offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word or two about this <e> <s> i

the whips office and i should prefer not to take amendment no <e> <s> now <e> <s> the explanatory and financial memorandum to this bill admits and the secretary of state said in committee that some areas would be worse off under the bill where more efficient use of rate subsidy does not offset the need to replace cross-subsidy <e> <s> those areas are likely to be the ones where low-rate subsidy is currently applied hence these areas still need regulation to be able to generate cross-subsidy <e> <s> this amendment if accepted should help to focus on the problem of increased rate expenditure to replace cross-subsidy in some areas and may force concessions on grea targets to help with this problem <e>", "<cs> having heard what my noble friend the minister said and listened to noble lords who have either supported or not supported me i beg leave to withdraw the amendment so that i can <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for his courteous reply to my amendment <e> <s> i

i think it will be very useful indeed to the authorities concerned and i am grateful to the government for having accepted the arguments that were put foward at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend the transport act used the wording in the interests of the public and so such a provision is not particular to this amendment <e> <s> however as i do not seem to have received much support i had better withdraw my amendment and see whether i can devise an even better one for next time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for putting down this amendment <e> <s> he was very kind at the committee stage and gave every help to me <e> <s> i am grateful to him for looking into it and succeeding in getting much better wording than mine <e> <s> i should also like to thank lord sandford who backed me in the other amendment <e> <s> between the two of us we managed to get two amendments accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to support this amendment <e> <s> i would be guilty of intense ingratitude if i did not thank my noble friend the minister for his ready help in the past <e> <s> this amendment is not meant to cause him any further troubles but to help him decide what is right for the future <e> <s> the amendment is not meant either as a back door way to frustrating the secretary of state and his intentions regarding this bill <e> <s> it enables a local authority to apply to him for the use of powers to specify a route or routes where protection against competition would apply <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always interesting to follow the noble earl <e> <s> i am not going into all the details he raised tonight but he always has something interesting to say <e> <s> i welcome the excellent speech made by the leader of the house <e> <s> he did

a few words in this debate because i spent over years near okehampton and visited it a great deal <e> <s> i should also like to say how pleased i am to see the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh here because he has been away for some considerable time and we missed him very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> it is essential that action is taken because far too few tenants know of their rights under the act <e> <s> perhaps some information could be given to them probably through advertisement in the local papers and so on to tell them their rights since in many cases the houses are getting into a very bad state of repair <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour to speak after the noble lord who has more experience than anyone else in this house and who always puts his case without exaggeration <e> <s> therefore the speech he has made today is all the more impressive because i think it is the first time i have heard him say anything which is a little against what the government are proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to make my apologies for not having been here for the whole debate but i had to attend a red cross blood transfusion meeting which went on rather longer than <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider that the reason for this debate is that my noble friend lady cox wanted to bring this subject before the house in order to try to save the future education of new generations <e> <s> i think she has done a great service in doing that and in pointing out matters in which we can take an interest today and perhaps see that what the motion refers to does not happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to houses in multiple occupation by imposing a duty on local housing authorities to enforce certain standards and to enable individuals to initiate proceedings in cases where the standards are not enforced <e> <s> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us i believe would wish to thank the noble

that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply but i do not thank him for calling me a virago because i do not think that i am <e> <s>

health officers and others tried to press them to do it and they just would not otherwise we would not have over million houses in this condition <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am delighted to join in

i am with the two concessions he has made <e> <s> they will be helpful <e> <s> i shall mention the third concession in a minute <e> <s> it is encouraging that he has heard from other governments that they have already indicated that they are likely to accept the new passports <e> <s> i do not know what the likely means but would it be possible to put down a question for written answer to get an idea which countries are going to accept these passports in the future <e> <s> then we shall be able to judge whether or not it is working well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for putting down his amendment <e> <s> it is reasonable and helpful and it would add clarity to the bill <e>

should like to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lord may i ask the noble earl whether he is aware that three stations have been opened on the western region and that they are very much appreciated with plenty of passengers taking trains rather than going by car <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have the opportunity to congratulate my noble friend on the <e>", "<cs> i also am grateful to the noble lord lord graham for tabling this amendment and to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> the noble and learned lord took the trouble to visit devonport and to see for himself exactly what was

in existence for years and which has provided the livelihood not only of the people who work there but of the whole city of plymouth <e> <s> the difference between rosyth and devonport is that rosyth

ministers of state there have been in recent years <e> <s> they all seem to have had different ideas <e> <s> this is what worries me about ministers of state for defence <e> <s> therefore we should
