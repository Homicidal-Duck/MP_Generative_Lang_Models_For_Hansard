["<cs> my lords your lordships will no doubt have noticed by looking at the clock that the noble lord lord soper has kept strictly within the time limit which he set for himself and i hope it may be encouraging to the house if i say at once that i hope to beat that limit by a substantial margin <e> <s> indeed it is always a difficult thing to follow the noble lord lord soper partly because he has usually said everything that one intended to say oneself and also because one is always faced with the fact that it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes perhaps he would allow me to ask a question <e> <s> he has drawn attention to the three ways in which he thinks that the evil of an elective dictatorship could be avoided <e> <s> would he agree that so far as this bill of rights is concerned it does not provide any safeguard against an elected majority in the other place carrying through a measure which intrudes upon the rights of the subject because of course it is provided under clause of this bill that if there is a conflict between subsequent legislation and the provisions of the convention then unless they can be reconciled the subsequent legislation must prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords l wonder whether it would be permitted for me although i have not put my name down on the list of speakers just to intervene for a few moments and i promise your lordships that i shall occupy your time for no longer than that <e> <s> i had the privilege with others who have spoken in the debate this afternoon of being on the select committee and unhappily i differed from my noble friend lord wade upon this issue <e> <s> on the last occasion when we discussed this matter in this house i did not have the opportunity to make any contribution and i should like briefly to indicate one reason at any rate why i found myself in the position of differing from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise to detain your lordships for only a few minutes tonight partly because i am preceded and followed by people who are much more knowledgeable on this matter than i am and partly because i am interested to know the answer that we are going to get from the minister <e> <s> very often people who ask unstarred questions are asking rhetorical questions and are not really seeking an answer <e> <s> on this occasion it is very important that we should be told if the government are able at this stage to give us some indication of the action they propose to take on the basis of the may committee report <e> <s> i do not share the noble earls very strong criticism of the work of the committee and indeed the report of the committee <e> <s> i think that they were as he acknowledges circumscribed by their terms of reference in a way which has precluded them from tackling some of the basic questions which arise on the matter of imprisonment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that <e> <s> my lords i am sure the may committee themselves and the chairman of the committee realise that they had been given a very difficult task in trying to cope with the problems in the time allowed even with the extension of the time which was given <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has already taken a rather curious although not perhaps an unexpected turn <e> <s> i should like to begin if i may by congratulating the noble earl upon the comprehensive way in which he explained this massive bill to us <e> <s> i do not know that i would congratulate him so much on the blandness with which he proposed to this house what are as i shall hope to show major constitutional changes but i feel we should all express our sympathy to the noble lord lord mccluskey for the task that he has had to perform this afternoon because he has been in the difficulty of course that he has had to express concern and doubt about provisions which appeared in the bill which was promoted by his own government a year or so ago <e> <s> not since agag has anybody had to walk so delicately as the noble lord <e> <s> as i understood it what he was saying to the noble earl over and over again was will you <e>", "<cs> my lords all i was saying was that in the course of my experience in the magistrates courts of this country i had never come across a case where the police had complained in any way that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord again but may i ask him this if as he suggests the object of the new section a of the act is to give the accused the opportunity of giving an explanation to the court why does he not give that explanation in reply to questions from his own advocate <e> <s> why is he required to answer the questions of the prosecutor <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will permit me to interrupt <e> <s> i said at the outset that my amendments were directed to clauses to and that of course includes clause <e> <s> but the noble lord may have realised that i have suggested no amendment to clause of this bill <e> <s> the powers of search under that clause are right and correct <e>", "<cs> i was not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> because that deals with another matter <e> <s> however while i am on my feet may i say to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey that the effect of my amendments nos <e> <s> to excluding amendment no <e> <s> is simply to remove altogether the witness from the exercise of these powers <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of my amendments and that is the extent to which they go <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i correct him <e> <s> i said no such thing <e> <s> i did not say that in the course of my experience as a lawyer i had never come across a case where anybody had ever refused to give his name and address <e> <s> of course i said nothing so stupid <e> <s> what i said was that i could not recollect any case in which the police had complained that their proper activities had been thwarted by the refusal of a witness to give his name and address <e>", "<cs> i am enormously encouraged not only by what the noble earl <e>", "<cs> that is a perfectly good example of what i was trying to say <e> <s> what is reasonable in the circumstances <e> <s> if one is dealing with nine people the period may he quite different from that which would be reasonable in relation to one person <e>", "<cs> yes the amendment says not exceeding half an hour that would mean that the policeman would have to get on with it <e> <s> but i see no great hardship in that it does not take one more than half an hour to ask for a persons particulars <e> <s> it may take one more than half an hour to check them but after all why should the person be kept there indefinitely if there is some particular difficulty in checking his identity <e> <s> let us suppose that the person who is stopped is a visitor from the channel islands or the united states of america and he does not have with him anything with which to identify himself <e> <s> is it going to be suggested that it is reasonable to keep him there for such time as is necessary in order to communicate with the police in the united states or in the channel islands <e>", "<cs> i will think while i am speaking <e> <s> i appreciate that this is a <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am inclined to take the course that he recommends <e> <s> if the noble earl would be good enough to say that he will have another look at this i should not think of pressing this to a division on this occasion <e>", "<cs> of course that is perfectly good enough for me <e> <s> before i seek leave to withdraw the amendment may i remind the noble earl and the noble and learned lord that this recommendation was regarded by the thomson committee as sufficiently important to appear in the summary of recommendations at the end of the report <e> <s> if this had been simply an aside on the part of the thomson committee if they had thought that this was a matter of little consequence i doubt whether it would have appeared in that solemn form among their positive recommendations <e> <s> again of course this was one of those cases when as with all their recommendations all the members of this high-powered committee were unanimous in recommending that this should he inserted <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies i should like to add a few words to that <e> <s> i should have thought that the purpose of the noble lord lord gifford is in fact covered here because there is the requirement that when a person is so <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i ought to try to answer this now or to give way <e> <s> i understand the situation to be this <e> <s> if under the new procedure a person is interrogated at the police station in the way that i have described and a record is made then under the provisions of the bill as its stands that record will be made by a police officer who would be expected to write down in his notebook the questions asked and the answers given by the accused at the interrogation <e> <s> in any subsequent trial all <e>", "<cs> i am hesitant about speaking about the present state of scottish law <e> <s> if the noble baroness is asking me to do that i should be reluctant to accept her invitation <e> <s> the noble baroness asked what would happen in the case of somebody who did not speak the language <e> <s> i take it that there would be an interpreter available <e> <s> that would be the case even if the only record being made was the record made by the police officer in his notebook <e> <s> there would be an interpreter and on the tape there would appear the question asked in english the translation of it into turkish or whatever the answer given by the accused in that language and then the interpretation of it by the interpreter back to the police officer <e> <s> i do not know that there is any difficulty in that <e> <s> the other question the noble baroness asked has escaped my mind <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i have any formed view <e> <s> i do not know that the thomson committee made any recommendation on that score one way or the other <e> <s> i do not think that the problem is a real one because at the present moment if the record is made by a police officer in his notebook he does not if then the suspect is released or is subsequently acquitted tear up his notebook <e> <s> the record is still there <e> <s> the situation would be no worse under the tape recording procedure than it is at the present moment under the procedure of recording it in a policemans notebook <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i should be regarded as such an authority on this matter which i certainly am not <e> <s> when one looks at clause of the bill one finds there that provision is made among other things that a person who has been charged with an offence is then brought up before the sheriff for a judicial examination <e> <s> it is at that stage according to clause that questions can be put to the accused man by the procurator fiscal in particular inviting his comments with regard to any confession that the man was alleged to have made when he was being tape recorded <e> <s> so he is given the opportunity at that judicial examination under the bill to offer any explanation that he wants to offer as to why he said what he did that he was confused muddled or what <e>", "<cs> in that case in a moment i shall ask my noble friends to support me in the division lobby but first may i make a few brief replies to some of the things which have been said in particular by the noble earl <e> <s> he says that it will not be practical to introduce tape recorders into police stations until they can be introduced into every police station <e> <s> i see no reason for that <e> <s> if you have a police station which is ill-equipped and does not have a tape recorder and if you continue to record as we have been recording up to now by a policeman taking it down in writing that would make the situation no worse than it is today <e> <s> but in all the police stations where you have a recorder you will have the advantage of the objective record which a tape recorder involves <e>", "<cs> falkee and dunkirk or wherever it was <e> <s> has the noble earl considered what the cost is in this country and in scotland of all the trials within trials that go on <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson will correct me if i am wrong but sometimes a trial within a trial can go on for days and even for weeks at a time <e> <s> what about all that expenditure of public money <e>", "<cs> i do not know how they manage in scotland <e> <s> am i to understand that there are no policemen in scotland who ever attribute to an accused person something that he has not said <e> <s> am i to believe that in scotland there is never an occasion when an accused person wrongly accuses the police of having tampered with the evidence <e> <s> if that is the case then of course you do not have any trials within trials in scotland but i should be surprised if the situation in scotland was so different from what it is in this country <e>", "<cs> may i first pursue the legal point <e> <s> although the noble and learned lord has endeavoured to explain three or four times i still do not see how he reconciles section or section for that matter with this particular clause <e> <s> i do not know whether this is either the time or the place to enter into an argument on legal interpretation of a statute but i am still satisfied that clause is wrong <e> <s> let me go over the matter again <e> <s> section deals with the case of any person who has been arrested on any criminal charge <e> <s> that is the person we are dealing with a person who has been arrested and because he has been arrested has been charged <e> <s> it is at that moment that section says that the police must immediately notify his solicitor <e>", "<cs> would it be proper and appropriate for me to intervene at this moment to ask the government what their intentions are for the continuation of this debate <e> <s> i do that for this reason <e> <s> there are no amendments down to clause and the next clause upon which we are going to embark is clause <e> <s> i think it will be agreed on all sides of the committee that that is a clause of first importance and it does not seem possible that we could give proper consideration to all the amendments that have been put down to it in particular if i may mention it the first amendment to clause which is in the name of the noble and learned lord lord wheatley <e> <s> it would be impossible for this committee at this time of night to give proper consideration to that clause and i would therefore ask the government whether they think it would be appropriate to adjourn this debate now and resume it upon the next convenient day <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with practically every word that the noble and learned lord has just spoken and i am confirmed in my belief that it is a great pity that we should be embarking upon a debate of this importance at this hour of night <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has made it perfectly clear that this clause raises matters of very considerable principle and importance <e> <s> if one looks at the marshalled list of amendments one finds that a variety of methods have been proposed for the amendment of this clause <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has been speaking not upon his own amendment which is no <e> <s> but upon the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord wheatley and we are still waiting to know what he will have to say about that <e> <s> then one finds that i and my noble friend lord wigoder have suggested amendment no <e> <s> and we are proposing further amendments nos <e> <s> and which are of a different character from those proposed by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> then we find amendment no <e> <s> which is proposed by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> all these matters if we are to get this right ought to be debated at length and with proper consideration <e>", "<cs> i am also anxious to co-operate in this matter and in view of what has been said i shall not be moving my amendments <e> <s> but i should just like to ask one question in passing and before we adjourn <e> <s> i take it that the fullest opportunity will be given at a later stage to consider all the possible solutions there are which have been offered and put forward for the amendment of this <e>", "<cs> my lords if other cuts are to be inflicted may we have an absolute assurance from the noble baroness that no mortal injury will be done to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether the situation in english law is not this that if a witness for the defence is summoned to the court on <e>", "<cs> did the noble and learned lord say that so far as the prosecution is concerned this matter is covered by section and by section of the act <e>", "<cs> am i not right in thinking that if one looks at section and i have had the opportunity to look at it only briefly one sees that the procedure which applies is as follows <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one point to that <e> <s> i think i am right in saying the noble and learned lord will correct me if i am wrong that there is the following difference between the proceedings for <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws his amendment if that is his intention perhaps i may raise a question about what the lord advocate said just now <e> <s> he said that there was no difference in meaning between the words contained in the bill and the words proposed by the noble and learned lord lord fraser <e> <s> to my simple mind there is a substantial difference in their effect <e> <s> the words proposed by the noble and learned lord are <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finishes may i ask this <e> <s> it follows the question asked by the noble earl lord selkirk about who initiates this application to the court <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock if i understood him correctly said it would be up to the court to decide whether they want to initiate this procedure <e> <s> surely the court are not going to do it on their own unless they have some reason to suppose that the convening of an intermediate diet if those are the right words would be useful helpful and have some point <e> <s> the court would not of its own initiative invoke the procedure <e> <s> does it not follow necessarily that the procedure would be invoked either by the prosecutor because he has some reason to think that the procedure would be useful or by the accused or his solicitor because he thinks the procedure would be helpful to the accused <e> <s> if that is the case what harm is there in carrying through this experiment to see how it works out <e> <s> the legal aid will be resorted to and expense will be incurred only if one of the parties at any rate to the procedure thinks that this procedure has some merit and purpose in their particular case <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could comment on whether i have got it right <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might make a purely technical point <e> <s> does the noble earl consider that the words that he proposes should be inserted under the proviso in clause would be better inserted after the word removed in line rather than after the word removed in line <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might make an observation or two about the procedure in england in summary trials when one is presented with a difficulty of this kind <e> <s> i have always understood and i think that the law today is as it has <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add an intermediate point between the view of the government and the views which have been expressed on this side of the committee <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wheatley surely went to the heart of the matter when he said that there is a problem here which has to be dealt with and is not being provided for at the present time but nevertheless the solution which is offered by the government is full of difficulties <e> <s> that is the situation as i <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about that last suggestion is that if the court is trying to find out objectively what the real circumstances of the accused are with a view to considering whether or not they should send him to prison surely a statement emanating from the counsel <e>", "<cs> i rather hesitate to intervene but i have been provoked into doing so by the words which have just fallen from the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> there is a major question here and also a minor question <e> <s> it seems to me that the provision which we have in our law in england at the present moment whereby a judge may and it is optional for the judge make a recommendation as to how long a person sentenced to life imprisonment should in fact remain in prison really is quite illogical <e> <s> it is certainly contrary to the christian principle that everyone is capable of redemption because it assumes that the judge when speaking about what is to happen in or years time and whether or not that particular individual will then <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could follow that <e> <s> if the situation is that the court gives an indication to a convicted person that if compensation is forthcoming he may be put on probation or given an absolute discharge that puts that defendant in an entirely privileged position as compared with the defendant who is in no position at that stage to make compensation because he does not have the money <e> <s> therefore in his case the offer will not be available <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said earlier that something i had said seemed to him to support his argument <e> <s> may i return to that for a moment <e> <s> the situation i was posing was this suppose some offender is brought in for having stolen some property or something and then he pleads guilty or is convicted <e> <s> the court then have to decide what to do with him <e> <s> if they think that the appropriate penalty would be for him to make compensation and then to be put on probation then if i understood the noble lord rightly earlier he was saying that if the defendant was in the position of being able to indicate to the court that he was able to make compensation then the court might appropriately put him on probation or even give him an absolute discharge <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point he has told us what he thinks is the position with regard to the witness i wonder if i may now ask what he thinks the position is with regard to the suspect if the police officer fails to carry out the proper routines <e>", "<cs> the fault was mine my lords i did not get up in time to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am very much obliged for what the noble earl has said and i am quite content to leave it in the way he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords if it does not embarrass the government too much i should like to say that i am on their side in this issue <e>", "<cs> i take the view that once you establish a principle and the government have adhered to this up to now that the moral duty of the citizen to give information to the police should at any rate in this respect be turned into a legal duty and that a citizen asked to give his name and address by a policeman should be under a legal duty to do that and of course i do not like that assumption but accepting it and that is what is in the bill it seems to me entirely unreasonable to make that an offence and yet deprive the police officer of the power to arrest somebody who in fact commits that offence <e>", "<cs> my lords in due course it may well be the law of england <e>", "<cs> my lords not only have the noble earl and the lord advocate introduced a new reading of the clause but as i read it it goes even further and reads even better than anything that was proposed in committee from this side of the house <e> <s> it is only right to acknowledge that this is one more admirable example of the way in which noble lords on the government front bench have listened to the pleas made to them and we are all hoping that we shall continue this stage of the bill in the same happy spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord mansfield for having made this small drafting amendment he was already aware of the error on the last occasion and it was not necessary for me to draw attention to it <e> <s> however i should like to take this opportunity of asking him a question not very dissimilar from one i asked in relation to some earlier admenments namely what is the position if a constable fails to comply with the requirements as it were the preliminaries before taking a person to a police station <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged i am glad to know i can do it <e> <s> i do not want to misinterpret <e> <s> i only wanted to quote the final question and answer <e> <s> mr dewar asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to prolong this debate certainly not by going into these technical questions that have been raised about the viability of a cheap system of tape recording <e> <s> i would only say that it strikes me as absolutely extraordinary that in the last quarter of the th century in the days of the computer the micro-chip and so on it is past the wit of man to invent a simple little machine which can record what has been said in a room and then to put a seal upon it in order that nobody can interfere with it <e> <s> if that is not possible to us then surely our technological revolution is not quite so admirable as it is claimed to be <e>", "<cs> my lords presumably one could go on with that argument for ever <e> <s> but the first point about it is this <e> <s> in the ordinary way the only people who will have the opportunity of tampering are the police and if the police are inclined to tamper with a machine how much more would they be inclined to tamper with the evidence under the present arrangements by which all they have to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene in a debate which is not on my own amendment but i cannot see the logic of the argument that is being advanced in support of this amendment <e> <s> i remember only too well that about years ago we had a major debate in the house on whether we should confirm the abolition of the death penalty <e> <s> if i remember rightly the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside took part in that debate <e> <s> the same thing was done on that occasion <e> <s> on the recommendation of the noble lord lord brooke of cumnor who was then mr henry brooke if i remember rightly when the death penalty was abolished it was provided that the abolition should cease to have effect unless within five years by affirmative resolution it was decided to continue it <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember on second reading when we raised this matter of who should conduct an examination and ask the questions that it was said then that this procedure of reviving the judicial examination was being done primarily for the benefit of the accused so that he would have an early opportunity if possible to clear himself altogether of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the appropriate amendment in view of what the noble lord has just said would be not to leave in the word explanation but rather to leave in the word comment and eliminate the others <e> <s> i say that for this reason <e> <s> if a person is brought up at this judicial examination and then asked to give an explanation of the matters referred to in the charge or anything of that kind that is automatically is it not <e> <s> an infringement of the principle that everybody is to be regarded as innocent until he has been proved to be guilty because the very words that the accused should be given an opportunity to put forward any explanation that he has to give presume that he has something to explain <e> <s> surely that is a presumption which is contrary to the general presumption of law that not only is he entitled to remain silent but also that it is no business of his to offer explanations about his conduct at any rate until he comes to be tried <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might comment upon two aspects of this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said quite rightly that it is of course difficult to find satisfactory words particularly when you come to paragraph ii the nature and particulars of that defence <e> <s> in the case of the alibi he said that as he saw it the way in which those words would apply was this <e> <s> if the accused person says yes i was elsewhere at the time then the procurator fiscal should be allowed to go on and say where were you <e> <s> and possibly who were you with <e> <s> and so on <e> <s> i do not see very much objection to that <e> <s> i do not know exactly what the procedure is in england at the present moment but as the noble and learned lord will probably know there is a provision in this country whereby if a person is intending when he gets up to the crown court to plead an alibi he is required to give notice of that alibi some seven days before the hearing in order that the police may have the opportunity of checking on it <e> <s> so far as i know under that procedure he has not got to give particulars of who he was with <e> <s> so far as i know he only has to say where he was and when in order that the police can make their inquiries <e> <s> i would have thought that would have been sufficient in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise two matters <e> <s> one is purely a matter of information <e> <s> under this new subsection at the top of page of the marshalled list i understood the noble and learned lord to say that if the accused at the judicial examination says i do not want to answer a question no one will have the opportunity later of commenting upon his refusal unless something is averred at the trial which conflicts or about which he might have been expected to give an explanation if the question had been put to him and he had replied to it <e> <s> what is the situation if this happens at the beginning of a judicial examination when the procurator fiscal gets up and begins to ask his first question what happens if the accused then saysi do not want to answer any questions and the matter therefore comes to a conclusion <e> <s> does the prosecutor then go on and say i shall put my questions to you in order that you can say to each one that you will or will not answer it <e> <s> if that happens i can understand that the system will work <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble and learned lord <e> <s> since i spoke i have been advised that the proper word is declinature <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say only that i am very much obliged to the noble earl for having inserted this amendment which expresses very much better than my original amendment what we both have in mind <e> <s> it is entirely in accord with the way in which the amendments proposed throughout the passage of this bill have been received by the front bench <e> <s> this is yet another example of the admirable and very satisfactory way in which the government have listened to the arguments which have been raised and i am very much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord boston of faversham in thanking the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> the noble lord may agree with me that the statement really falls into two parts <e> <s> the first part deals with what has properly been described by the noble lord lord boston as the crisis in our prison system and although the statement does not use that word i think it is clearly the view of the government that we are faced with a situation of very great gravity <e>", "<cs> my lords before i withdraw the motion i should like first to thank all those who have taken part in the debate particularly my noble friends for the way in which they have filled out the wide gaps which were left when i sat down <e> <s> as i said at the very beginning this debate has been justified if only because it has evoked that speech to which we have just listened from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be prepared to indicate to the house how many civil service man hours were involved in extracting and preparing the information given in response to this question <e> <s> can he furthermore tell us what relevance that information has to the working of the rent acts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether there is the slightest prospect of speakers on the housing bill confining themselves to minutes and if they did would not this be wholly unprecendented in the history of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on from that he tells us that there is a programme in the home office to provide more bail hostels <e> <s> could he give us an indication as to how many places will be available under this programme and what the time-scale for the programme is <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is not perhaps of all that importance but i was going to ask the noble and learned lord whether he considers as a matter of english grammar that you can accelerate a process of consolidation <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in support of my noble friend on a rather different ground from the one on which he has put the matter to the committee <e> <s> it seems to me and i do not know whether i am the only person in the committee who has this reaction that subsection which the amendment seeks to delete is almost unprecedented in the legislative history of this country <e> <s> if one looks at the clause one finds that subsection paragraphs <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord in order i hope to help him <e> <s> i should like to draw his attention to clause which provides that <e>", "<cs> may i follow the noble lord before the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter because there is something i want to withdraw <e> <s> when i interrupted the noble lord lord stewart and drew his attention to clause of the bill i was in error <e> <s> it is correct that the particular subsection we are talking about does come under the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> i accept that and i apologise to the committee for having temporarily at any rate misled them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i wonder whether i might be allowed to intervene for one moment simply to say this i am sure that my brother michael would be very glad to be associated with all the tributes that have been paid to the virtue of this house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> before the minister finally sits down on this matter he has now undertaken to see whether he can find an answer to the questions which were addressed to him by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> but in a little while as i understand it this committee will be asked to vote on this amendment <e> <s> it cannot be left like that <e> <s> the noble lord has asked certain questions to which a factual answer can be given <e> <s> no answer has been given and i understand that in a few minutes time we shall be invited to go into the lobbies without any satisfactory answers or indeed any answer at all having been given to these vital questions <e> <s> i suggest to the committee that that is a wholly unsatisfactory state of affairs <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend says what he will do may i say that i have listened to this discussion and i find myself in two minds about it <e> <s> there are obviously a lot of arguments on both sides but i fear that my noble friends amendment is defective in one particular <e> <s> the amendment provides that the commission may if it thinks fit direct that the names of the parties shall not be publicised <e> <s> this is not a court of law <e> <s> when a court of law in its discretion says that the name of the victim of a blackmailer is not to be published and then someone disobeys that as a nephew of mine did some years ago he can be brought up for contempt of court but i know of no <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help thinking that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey was a little ungenerous to the government <e> <s> i recognise that there has been long and anxious consideration about the clause <e> <s> however it should be recognised that the clause which was introduced originally by the government in this house was closely examined and that during the course of the debates the govenment gave way on a number of matters and incorporated various things for which we on these benches and on the opposition benches had asked <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact is it not <e> <s> and the noble and learned lord will be able to tell us that over the years ever since the act was passed successive lord advocates have given as the reason for not authorising prosecutions of consenting adults in scotland for acts committed in private the view that they are not prepared to take action which would be contrary to what has since that time been the law of england <e> <s> they have not given as a reason for their failure to prosecute the fact that they cannot get the evidence or the corroboration <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong this debate for a minute longer than it need last <e> <s> indeed i am anxious that we should get to a division if we are going to have a division at all <e> <s> everything that can be usefully said on the subject has already been said <e> <s> i am not going to say anything about the merits of the matter because that has already been most admirably said by the noble lords lord shackleton and lord boothby <e> <s> i have nothing to add to that <e>", "<cs> it depends what representations we get from northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i do not know what representations the noble lord had from scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a comment about that <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary because if that is right then the minister if he likes to do so can stand up when the debate has proceeded only a little while and thereby effectively terminate the debate <e> <s> what is happening here today in my submission is a pretty shabby business altogether <e> <s> i was present on the previous occasion when we discussed this question in committee <e> <s> we had then a very full debate a much fuller <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that was an interruption of what i was saying <e> <s> before the noble lord lord sandys got up just now in order to bring this debate to an end my noble friend lord simon had made two or three attempts to speak <e> <s> there has not been any intervention in this particular debate from these benches <e> <s> although my noble friend lord simon attempted to get up to speak on our behalf he was interrupted and prevented from doing so by the noble lord lord sandys <e> <s> i only say this in conclusion <e> <s> i am not discussing the merits of this matter one way or another <e> <s> but i will say this <e> <s> if after full debate in committee in this house when all the arguments have been deployed the government is defeated i would have thought that the proper and sensible thing for them to do if they are so embarrassed by the amendment which has been carried would be to take the matter up in the other place when it goes back there and not bring it up again in this house <e> <s> that is all i want to say about that matter <e> <s> i suggest that it is improper that there should not be a full debate especially upon a matter on which the verdict went against the government on the earlier occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to add my warm congratulations to those already extended to the two noble earls who have made their maiden speeches today <e> <s> a month or two ago when we were discussing the composition of this house i offered the view that the contribution made by peers who are here by hereditary right was a very substantial one to the affairs of the house and that opinion has been fully endorsed by the speeches that we have heard from the noble earls <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws the amendment i should like to make one suggestion for the consideration of the noble and learned lord when he is looking at the matter again <e> <s> might not this subsection be made to conform with what appears in clause <e> <s> might it not be made better to conform if instead of inserting the words a substantial before the word risk we were to put in after the words risk of the words serious prejudice <e> <s> that would make it comply and conform with the words in the earlier clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister for not being in my place when he rose to speak though i am glad to say i had the opportunity of hearing his remarks about section of the order which is my particular concern and i hope it is appropriate for me to make a few general observations about that <e> <s> some years ago i cannot remember in what connection i moved an amendment in your lordships house to try to amend the law which requires a person remanded in custody prior to conviction or committal to be brought before a magistrates court every eight days <e> <s> i argued on that occasion as indeed everybody who practices the law in the magistrates courts of this land knows very well that in many cases the appearance of an accused person in that way is absolutely pointless <e> <s> it is pointless unless he has some application to make to the court as for example an application for bail or a renewal of an application for bail <e> <s> it is quite pointless for him to be brought before the court as a pure formality <e>", "<cs> i am obliged my lords but i am afraid the vote went against me <e> <s> i was about to urge that possibly that matter might be reconsidered after this period of years <e> <s> i argued then i do not think it is in dispute that in many of these cases where a person is brought before the court in that way every eight days it serves no useful purpose from the accuseds point of view unless as i say he has an application to make as to bail <e> <s> in a great number of cases this must be repeated in our magistrates courts prior at any rate to the introduction of this order every day in hundreds of instances <e> <s> people are carted about the country from prison to magistrates court put in the dock the prosecution the police apply for a further remand in custody the man is asked whether he has any objection he says he has none and he is then taken down to the cells and carted back to the place from which he came <e>", "<cs> i should like to make three comments if i may and also to make one thing clear if it is not clear already to the committee which is that this is possibly the only matter in the world on which my noble friends on these benches are not absolutely united <e> <s> they are almost united <e> <s> it is arguable whether almost united is or is not a grammatical error <e> <s> however i will leave that on one side and i think i speak now on behalf of the great majority of my colleagues <e> <s> i very much welcome both amendments and i should like to ask a question of both the noble lord lord craigton and the noble lord lord underhill in order to clear my mind somewhat <e> <s> i am in favour of both amendments <e> <s> i think there is great virtue in the proposal that the nature conservancy council shall serve this notice upon people telling them that it is a site of special scientific interest and stating also what the interest is <e> <s> there is great virtue in that <e> <s> i also think that there is considerable virtue if it were to follow upon that in attaching the terms of this section of the bill to all sssis and then leaving it to the secretary of state if he thinks fit to make exclusions <e> <s> i should have thought that that would go a very long way to overcoming any of the administrative difficulties about which we have been hearing this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to know if i could from both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord craigton whether the two amendments can be combined together <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak for one moment to deal with this suggestion made by the noble lord opposite that you could have a case in which the offence had been committed involuntarily by somebody who did not properly understand the situation <e> <s> there are i suggest two answers to that <e> <s> one is that if one looks at the provisions of this clause one sees very clearly that the owner or occupier of land will know perfectly well whether the secretary of state has in fact designated his land as land which is of particular value for flora and fauna and the rest and thereafter if he wants to undertake an operation of course he has to put in his application <e> <s> then his application is considered by the planning authority or by the minister <e> <s> so there is not the slightest chance that he could afforest a stretch of land without knowing what he was doing <e> <s> further than that if you did have a case in which the defendant could show in subsequent proceedings that he had been genuinely mistaken that would obviously be a circumstance which the court would consider in deciding whether to impose the additional penalty of having to restore the land <e> <s> so i would <e>", "<cs> may i add just three sentences in support of everything that the noble lord lord melchett has said <e> <s> i do not want to add anything to the argument <e> <s> i agree with him that this clause is a bad cosmetic operation and is likely to prove absolutely futile in conserving these valuable places <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be impressed by the fact that this expression of opinion comes from all sides of the house <e> <s> this is not a party matter but it is a matter of desperate concern and disappointment to practically every conservationist body in the country that the government have not been able to produce anything more effective than this <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord melchett replies i wonder whether i might add a postscript to what the noble lord lord houghton has been saying <e> <s> i shall make a suggestion to the noble lord lord denham in a minute which i hope will help him with the business so perhaps he will listen to the two or three sentences that i want to say before i deal with that <e>", "<cs> i will try to confine what i have to say to two sentences <e> <s> they deal with what the noble earl said about the consultation procedures which are very familar to me <e> <s> we have had them on dartmoor for many years <e> <s> the noble earl is perfectly right in saying that generally speaking they have worked quite well <e> <s> if this amendment were carried it would in no way threaten or detract from those procedures <e> <s> those consultations will go on as before <e> <s> the fault with the procedures is that the understanding on which they are based does not bind the individual <e> <s> there is nothing to stop an individual if he is so minded from going ahead with his afforestation projects without even informing the national park committee <e> <s> that is the defect of the procedure <e> <s> so there is nothing to be lost if the minister will agree to accept this amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> it will be observed that when we come in a moment to the amendments which stand in the name of the noble viscount lord ridley and others we are there recommending that with moorland conservation orders it should be the negative procedure not the affirmative procedure <e> <s> one of the reasons why i think that that is right is because i do not believe it to be sensible that if ministers are proposing to make an order under clause making the order apply to acres of land in exmoor i do not think it is reasonable that both houses should be asked to discuss this and carry an affirmative resolution <e> <s> i think it is something with which these houses ought not to be concerned <e> <s> under the negative resolution procedure anybody who is interested and concerned and who thinks that something is wrong has every opportunity of raising the matter <e> <s> therefore i do not think there is much to be said for the noble lord proposal <e>", "<cs> i was going to hold out a little longer and if lord sandford has risen to his feet just now i would have been very happy to let him go ahead of me because he can speak with much greater authority upon this matter than i can <e> <s> but there are one or two small contributions that i should like to make to this debate which will be partly an attempted reply to what we have heard from lord de la warr and partly in <e>", "<cs> yes thank you very much <e> <s> i agree with that <e> <s> of course on the sssis and these moorland conservation orders we are at one <e> <s> they are at great risk <e> <s> the two most important debates in the whole of this bill were on the amendments which we put down on clauses and <e> <s> i have spoken for longer than i had intended <e> <s> may i conclude with something which i hope may allay the fears and anxieties and i dare say that there are fears and anxieties among the farming community <e> <s> it was indicated to me this morning by somebody in the corridor that there were some devon farmers here today who are anxious and concerned about the implications of these amendments <e> <s> may i make it clear how many safeguards there are in the proposals we are making <e> <s> first there cannot be any activation of these compulsory procedures unless both ministers that is the secretary of state for the environment and the minister for agriculture are agreed in designating the critical areas of land <e>", "<cs> i accept that rebuke <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i have certainly gone on for too long and i will not spoil the matter by pursuing it any further <e> <s> but could i conclude by saying that in spite of the rebuke i am wholly in support of what the noble viscount lord ridley is proposing <e>", "<cs> may i add one word before my noble friend replies <e> <s> two or three years ago i had the opportunity of initiating in your lordships house a debate on the ridgeway and we had a very full discussion at that time <e> <s> i should like to say that i have listened with great interest and indeed satisfaction to the assurances that have been given by the noble lord lord bellwin because i think it is the most forthcoming statement we have had about the problem of these greenlanes from any government in the last years and of course i know perfectly well that it is sincerely meant <e>", "<cs> may i add one suggestion to that <e> <s> i am not entirely satisfied with what the minister has said about this amendment and about its being quite unnecessary <e> <s> i ask your lordships to consider this situation <e> <s> let us suppose that there is a contest as to whether a right of way does or does not exist and then an inspector holds an inquiry in order to ascertain the facts <e> <s> let us further suppose that the person who is trying to resist the right of way draws attention in the course of his argument to the fact that the right of way does not appear upon any map <e> <s> if this amendment which the noble lord is recommending were carried it would be perfectly open to the inspector to say i am sorry i cannot listen to any evidence about that because that is not evidence on the matter at all <e> <s> in the absence of this amendment and looking at the clause as it is now framed i suggest that the inspector would be in some doubt as to whether he was entitled to refuse to consider the fact that perhaps over a long period of time the way had never appeared upon a map <e> <s> i suggest that this amendment would eliminate doubt on that matter and could do no possible harm <e>", "<cs> in view of the attitude which the noble and learned lord has taken it would be clearly foolish to try to pursue the matter any further today but may i comment upon one thing which fell from his lips <e> <s> he said at the very beginning about the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mishcon that he thought it would introduce a new and unhappy ill-feeling between the two professions <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would consider this is it not rather undesirable that as matters <e>", "<cs> greatly to my regret i feel that the noble and learned lord and i are at cross-purposes here because if i understand the matter aright legal aid has nothing whatever to do with it <e> <s> the case in which an interim payment can arise is where a is suing b a wins the day and receives judgment on the matter of liability and the question of quantum is perhaps left open <e> <s> at that stage the court has power to make an order in favour of a against b ordering that b shall make a payment on account of the damages which a is entitled to recover <e> <s> that has nothing whatever to do with costs <e> <s> but when it comes to costs the order for an interim payment of costs would relate to the costs which were owed by b to a under the judgment <e> <s> so as i understand it the question of any burden on the legal aid fund does not arise in any way <e>", "<cs> i am a little horrified at the gross discrepancy between the calculations of the noble and learned lords department and the calculations that have been made by the law society <e> <s> it is true that the law societys calculations were made i think in but i hope that inflation has not been so outrageous in the intervening period that the figure has climbed up to <e> <s> i wonder whether between now and the report stage the noble and learned lord would allow the representatives of the law society to consult with his department upon the matter of cost because i think that the law society might be able to make some useful suggestions on how the matter might be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for more than a minute <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble baroness lady elliot that so far as i know nobody who has supported this amendment and this proposition throughout the debates that we have had has ever suggested that the farming community are not interested in conservation <e> <s> i have never heard that suggested by anybody <e> <s> what we are concerned about and this is what the noble baroness does not appear to understand is not the problem of dealing with the farmers who have a sense of responsibility the problem is dealing with the very tiny minority who have no sense of responsibility and who if they can will pursue their own interests regardless of the broader public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted only to indicate that i know as little about this matter as evidently does the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two comments on that speech <e> <s> the first refers to the merits of the matter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said rightly that the number of people who might want to avail themselves of the right to apply to the crown court and have legal aid in support of that would probably be between and a year <e> <s> that is the calculation of his own department <e> <s> if it be right that people who would apply if given the chance are now being thwarted from being able to do so and have to rely only on the wholly unsatisfactory system of having to go to a high court judge in chambers that means that the number of people who are suffering injustice at the moment is about <e> <s> i do not see that the injustice is any less because the figure is not <e> <s> if people are being treated unfairly and improperly that seems to me to be a blot on the system and the object of my little amendment is try to put it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could take the opportunity to ask one fairly simple question of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the words used here are legal advisers <e> <s> i wonder whether there is anything in this bill which defines the meaning of the phrase legal advisers <e> <s> whether there is or is not does it in fact mean the persons solicitors and if it does mean the persons solicitors why do we not say so <e> <s> could it in fact have a wider meaning than that and could it embrace somebody else as for example an amateur adviser or possibly even learned counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have the leave of the <e>", "<cs> my lords while that may be all very well is it not a little humiliating to this house that whereas we have used as one of the excuses for our existence the fact that we are a revising chamber that lot has now fallen upon the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to detain the house for only a few moments <e> <s> i shall refrain from the temptation to discuss any further the merits or demerits of this bill <e> <s> i should like in a few moments to ask the government some questions about how the bill will be dealt with in the later stages of committee report and third reading <e> <s> perhaps i can express what i want to say in the form of three propositions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i associate my noble friends with what has been said in congratulation to the noble viscount <e> <s> he has performed a very valuable service <e> <s> we endorse everything that has been said on that account <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to everything that the noble lord lord boston of faversham has said about this subject but at the end of it i am afraid i do not share his alarm at the extension of this imprisonment temporary provisions act for a further months <e> <s> he said as i understood it at the beginning that he thought that under this temporary act the home secretary was taking to himself what he called i think draconian powers which were a threat to the civil liberties which we in this country enjoy <e> <s> with one exception to which i will make some reference in a minute i do not know of anything which has been done under this act which has infringed anybodys liberty at all and i cannot see any reason why in the next months if this act is given a further extension for that period what has not occurred during the last months should occur during the next months <e>", "<cs> my lords that is only another illustration of the fact that the people in my party disagree very often and now we have the additional advantage that we can fall out with the sdp <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all join with the noble lord lord mischon in expressing the thanks of the house to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the remarkable piece of exposition which we had at the beginning of this debate <e> <s> i was particularly grateful for it because i have been trying to read the bill over the last day or two <e> <s> great stretches of it remain a complete mystery <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest attention to what the noble baroness has just been saying <e> <s> i was indeed anxious to know what advice she was going to give to her noble friends as to how they should deal with this bill <e> <s> i listened to her final remarks and i came to the conclusion that she is going to vote against the second reading of the bill <e> <s> i hope that i am wrong about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged and very relieved to hear that the noble baroness at any rate is not going to oppose the bill at this stage because it would be perfectly possible at a later stage if she so wished to move an amendment which would introduce an amended form of the subsection which we find so objectionable <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the distinction but with respect i do not understand that argument <e> <s> i can see no reason if this bill goes through in a short period of time in this house and then goes to the other house and i hope goes through on the nod there why that should discourage the government from introducing more general legislation incorporating the sort of amendments the noble baroness wants <e> <s> she is very much more skilled as a politician than i am i am an innocent in these matters but i do not see why the government should be persuaded to hold their hand simply because the noble lord lord monson gets his bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord tell us first how many applications are refused in bombay in the course of a year and secondly why it is when once a refusal has been decided upon that it takes longer than say half an hour to draw up the explanation as to why the refusal has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords does it follow from that that in the case of only refusals in the course of the year it took an average of eight months to prepare the explanatory statement as to why the refusals were made <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order may i inquire whether this bill will take the place of the existing statutes of the realm <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always been a hit mystified by the procedures in this house when we are considering a private bill and i am bound to say my state of mystification has not been reduced by the arguments to which we have been listening so far <e> <s> as i understand it the procedure is this if somebody promotes a private bill the first question which has to be decided by this house is whether it is going to give it a second reading and send it to a select committee <e> <s> that matter has already been decided because the bill was given a second reading and sent to a select committee without any argument or dispute <e> <s> i listened particularly to the argument the noble lord lord morris was advancing that this is an unnecessary bill to do something that could have been done by other means and the noble lord lord beswick said much the same thing <e> <s> if that is right that would have been an argument which should have been advanced against second reading <e> <s> if it is a waste of public money to send this bill to a select committee they ought to have opposed it at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord is speaking for his own benches <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene as i understand it he is saying that part iii is useful and ought to be carried through but the argument which was addressed to us previously by lord beswick in particular was that the purposes of the bill could be accomplished without a private bill <e> <s> is it not the case that the purposes of part iii could have been accomplished without a private bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord is about to sit down but following on that point am i right in thinking that the promoters have to satisfy the select committee of all the matters contained in the preamble <e> <s> is it right that in the preamble to this bill it is said that the objects of this act cannot be attained without the authority of parliament <e> <s> i merely put to the noble lord the chairman of committees a matter of fact it will be the business will it not <e> <s> of the promoters to substantiate that claim when they come before the select committee <e>", "<cs> may i draw attention to one small matter <e> <s> these two amendments that we are talking about relate to two quite different matters <e> <s> the first amendment and the noble baroness who moved the amendment i think did not refer to this at all <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness did i beg her pardon <e> <s> i did not hear it <e> <s> the first amendment is to insert the words or political after religious <e> <s> if i understood what the noble lord was saying from the front bench he is disinclined at the moment to accept that <e> <s> when he comes to reconsider the whole matter i hope he will think better of that <e> <s> it is an important matter <e> <s> if the political meetings are not included then it would be dangerous for the labour party to conclude their conferences by singing the red flag because that would clearly be incidental to a political meeting <e> <s> they would be opening themselves to penalties for not having applied for a licence <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will in due course consider that it is right to include political meetings <e>", "<cs> may i say a word or two in support of fire precautions <e> <s> it is some time since i was actively engaged in practice before a magistrates court but my recollection of licensing law is and i think it is the same today as when i was practising that whenever an application is made for the grant of a licence or whenever an application is made by a licensed premises for some physical alteration in the premises it is incumbent upon the magistrates to take the opinion of the fire officers upon the proposed alterations or upon the state of the premises as a whole <e> <s> therefore i cannot see there is very much virtue in the argument which the noble lord was making <e> <s> as far as i know these arrangements which have been in existence for a long time have worked satisfactorily and there is no reason to support that the magistrates are not a satisfactory body for making decisions of that kind <e>", "<cs> i never like to look a gift horse in the mouth and certainly i should be ready to withdraw the amendment at this stage but i hope that i am not precluded from making one or two observations on the noble lords arguments <e> <s> he said if there were a rigid system whereby on every occasion when a demolition is contemplated the local authority must consult the undertakers as to whether there are any electric gas or water installations involved that would impose a heavy burden upon the authority <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot at all understand that view <e> <s> the amendment does not specify the way in which the consultations must take place <e> <s> if it is a mandatory requirement that in every case where a demolition notice is contemplated automatically the local authority must communicate with the statutory undertakers the authority could do that perfectly well by lifting up the telephone if it chose <e>", "<cs> i will look at that <e> <s> i am completely ignorant of the terms of the act which the noble lord quoted <e> <s> i am glad that i am not moving a third amendment because the noble lord becomes less forthcoming the longer we go on <e> <s> i am grateful for the answer <e> <s> on this occasion i shall not do anything other than to ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene for a moment in order to give my unqualified support to what has been said by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on this matter <e> <s> i do not say that because i shall shortly be moving some amendments myself and hoping to curry favour with him <e> <s> i only want to say a word or two about the argument that has been used namely that they have had this system in scotland since i think and that there is no reason to suppose that it has not worked perfectly admirably <e> <s> i should have thought that there is every reason to suppose that it has not worked admirably because as the noble and learned lord has said today the scottish courts are being called upon to answer unanswerable questions <e> <s> who is to know what indignation there may be in some of these cases where an award of so much is given to one person and an award of half that amount is given to another <e> <s> this is an argument which is used far too often in this house and elsewhere that they have done this in other countries in the past and it seems to have worked all right <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i said at the beginning that i had had it in mind to move both amendments at the same time <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would permit me then to speak now in support of my second amendment and then what he has to say which is already written down will be relevant <e> <s> this is an amendment which in my view is of some importance <e> <s> part i the part of the bill we are now dealing with is concerned with the amendment of the law on civil liability for personal injuries and the law on damages in such cases <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged for that reply <e> <s> i never intended to press the amendments <e> <s> there is i think one small point of misunderstanding in that there is no real relationship between the first amendment and the second amendment <e> <s> the first amendment is designed simply to clarify the existing law inviting the noble and learned lord as lord chancellor to produce a formula for calculating the maintenance provided to the injured person by the state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i need the leave of the house to reply but may i first of all apologise profoundly to the noble and learned lord for not having read his letter until now <e> <s> if there is any greater disaster in life than not hearing from the noble and learned lord it is to get a letter from him and then for it to go astray <e> <s> i should like to apologise on my own behalf and on behalf of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not in order <e> <s> i will withdraw that <e> <s> i am sorry if i have offended against <e>", "<cs> my lords it was actually and the noble earl has put that point of view with great clarity <e> <s> perhaps i could explain in a little more detail what i meant when i said just now that unless a contractor does in certain circumstances give the necessary notice to the local authority and he is presumed to have done so because he is the agent of the local authority that fact may be known in one department of the local authority but may never come to the attention of the building control officer who is the person who is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl and the government for having considered the representations i made on this matter on the last occasion and for having come up with this proposal of their own <e> <s> let me say at once that my objectives and the objectives of the government are precisely the same we are both concerned to avoid in the case of demolition work damage to the gas and electricity installations that may be there we are both concerned to avoid public danger <e> <s> the difference between the noble earl and myself is a difference as to how to go about it <e> <s> what i originally proposed was that the notification should be made to the contractor by the local authority that they should be obliged to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the government for having taken into consideration what i said on the last occasion although i am sorry that on this occasion i do not really think that what the government are now proposing to do really meets my point at all <e> <s> indeed in some ways i am afraid that this is a retrograde move <e> <s> in order to explain that let me say first that this series of amendments are amendments to what is now section b subsection <e> <s> perhaps i might read that to your lordships <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking to them both <e> <s> i thought that the noble earl was dealing with them both at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i made the mistake just now of thinking that the noble earl was talking on all three amendments <e> <s> again i am grateful to him for explaining the governments view but i still beg leave to disagree with him <e> <s> the question may arise and i think it does arise why is it that it has been felt necessary to deal with electricity in a different way from gas <e> <s> when one looks at the noble earls amendment at paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine myself simply to the issue and the question of immunity <e> <s> as the noble lord lord nugent has disclosed already i was the minority voice on the matter of immunity and not for the first time in my life i found myself in a minority of one <e> <s> in those circumstances i hope that the house will think it not inappropriate at any rate that i should indicate in the briefest possible terms the reasons why i came to the conclusion which i did <e> <s> i am sorry to use the phrase not inappropriate because it is a double negative and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept that <e> <s> i am glad to hear that the matter is regarded as one of some concern by the home office and that is some consolation at any rate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the minister for his explanation of this order <e> <s> it is a highly technical subject on which i should hesitate to embark but i am very much relieved to know from the minister that this order is being asked for approval on the basic principle that it is going to bring the planning law of northern ireland more into line with the law which prevails in england and wales <e> <s> that is a principle which my noble friends and i strongly support and about which i should like to say a few words on the next order when the minister produces it <e> <s> i do not have any questions of the noble earl and am very grateful to him that this order is to be brought before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the happy position of agreeing with every word that the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has spoken <e> <s> he started off by saying quite rightly that this was certainly not a party political issue <e> <s> i was particularly glad that yesterday in the other place this was a matter of a free vote and there was no attempt to line up the political parties <e> <s> because it is not a party political matter i speak today for myself rather than for my noble friends but i suspect that the majority of my noble friends like me will welcome this order <e> <s> indeed some of us including myself believe that it is long overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords oscar wilde once said as i recall that a man would need to have a heart of stone to be able to read the story of the death of little nell without laughing <e> <s> in much the same sense i would say to the house that one would need to have a heart of stone not to sympathise with the noble lord who is going to reply to this debate <e> <s> indeed at this late hour i do not want to try to contribute to the argument but i think the unstarred question which the noble lord lord wells-pestell has put raises another question that is whether what takes place in your lordships house and in the debates in this house really matter because here tonight we have had a debate in which no single voice has been raised in support of the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that it is a little unfortunate that a report of this importance running to only pages should cost the general public net <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the matter of the ordnance survey <e> <s> i should like to open my remarks by agreeing with the minister in thanking the noble lord lord shackleton for having brought the matter before the house <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity to say and i am sure that this will be supported from all sides of the house that it is very nice to see the noble lord back again we see too little of him <e> <s> i want to start with a remark that will receive universal agreement but i do not think that i shall proceed much further on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak in this little debate tonight with considerable diffidence because i have no special knowledge of the grendon experiment and i stand at the disadvantage of following on the two speeches to which we have listened <e> <s> no one who interests himself in the problems of penal reform can fail to share the alarm which is expressed in the noble lords question <e> <s> i am not sure that alarm is the right word <e> <s> i think despair might be a more appropriate word <e>", "<cs> is it necessary to have clause at all <e>", "<cs> before the discussion comes to a conclusion may i make a further point in support of what the noble lord lord mishcon says <e> <s> is not the material word in clause in this context the word dissemination <e> <s> is not that word wholly inappropriate to giving advice to a particular individual <e> <s> is not the whole effect of this subsection if you read it together enabling the registrar and requiring the registrar to disseminate circulars of information and advice to the general public <e> <s> is not the point that the noble and learned lord was making in the first place correct <e> <s> that there is nothing at the present moment in the bill which specifically authorises empowers and requires the registrar to give advice in individual cases <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord tell us the paragraph from which he is quoting because i want to follow it <e>", "<cs> my lords about one matter there is no doubt <e> <s> everybody who listens to this debate and who takes part it in will respect the motives that have prompted the noble earl lord onslow and the noble lord lord renton to promote this bill <e> <s> secondly i am at a very considerable disadvantage in speaking immediately after the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it is hazardous at any time to follow him but it is particularly hazardous when we are discussing a matter of legal importance and he has managed to say practically everything that i was intending to say <e> <s> therefore my speech will be very largely simply a matter of underlining very briefly some of the points which he has already made <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from these benches may i say that when anything is proposed to the house by the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack and at the same time is commended to the house by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i think the house will agree that it must be right <e> <s> at any rate that is the view that we share on <e>", "<cs> my lords a few days ago when i was out of london i was asked whether i would say a few words from these benches about this bill today <e> <s> i was then in some doubt as to whether i could undertake the task and at that stage i had not seen the bill <e> <s> but i was greatly reassured when i learned that the bill was being promoted by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> we have all learned over the years that if some case is being advocated promoted or defended by the noble baroness it is almost certain to be all right <e> <s> the only thing that causes me some surprise from time to time is that the noble baroness apparently finds herself at ease on those reactionary benches in spite of the wisdom of her speeches in this house and her devotion to all good causes <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether if we should say no to this proposition it will form part of the tory partys manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion when we debated this matter on th may i spoke briefly from these benches giving all the support i could to the noble baroness and her bill <e> <s> i certainly do not intend on this occasion to try and repeat what little i said on that other occasion <e> <s> however i should like to thank her as i did originally not only for her initiative in producing this bill but now for her perseverance in promoting it again in this new parliament and again as i did previously i wish the bill well <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine my remarks to one point only <e> <s> it is a legal point and on that account may not be very popular <e> <s> it is not a criticism of the bill but expresses the belief that if any high hopes or expectations have been raised and i am speaking now only about clause that this is a major advance those expectations may be disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords when i am called upon to speak in a second reading debate at this late hour i tend to be oppressed by the thought that everything that can properly be said has been said and sometimes much else besides <e> <s> but it is not idle courtesy to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor or to the others who have taken part in this debate to say that this has been a most useful debate because it has enabled us to identify the issues raised by this bill and indeed to identify to a large extent the matters which we shall be considering later in committee at report and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to take part briefly in this important debate partly because it does not often happen in this life that one is able in a debate to find oneself in a position where there is everything to be said on one side and nothing to be said on the other <e> <s> that is one reason why i take satisfaction in joining in the debate <e> <s> nothing could be more ridiculous than the words free pardon <e> <s> both words are inappropriate <e> <s> pardon is obviously inappropriate if you are exonerating somebody who has been wrongly convicted <e> <s> what does free mean <e> <s> does it mean that he has not paid for it <e> <s> this is something which in a small way brings the law into disrepute <e> <s> i have known cases where people have been convicted for speeding and what has happened is that the police have followed them taken their speed over a certain distance and then it has been found subsequently that the police misunderstood the distance that they got it wrong <e> <s> therefore for all the people who have been concerned with that particular car or that particular police officer over that particular distance the conviction has to be cancelled <e> <s> therefore they are granted a free pardon <e> <s> my lords i should hesitate to use in this house the sort of language that is used by people who find themselves in that situation <e> <s> i have the greatest possible pleasure in supporting this motion <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord withdraws the amendment as i imagine he is about to do may i just make this observation <e> <s> it is well known to those who practise in this field that there is a power in the court to award maintenance in favor of children who are undergoing higher education above the age of <e> <s> that i fully understand but it does not seem to me to be a full answer to the noble and learned lords contention for this reason that what section provides is that in considering the matter of maintenance first consideration shall be given to the welfare of any child of the family who has under the amendment of the noble and learned lord not attained the age of <e>", "<cs> i took the view when i was considering this part of the bill that the best course was to strike out all reference to conduct <e> <s> that would mean deleting paragraph <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord moves on from that point may i remind him that the law commission themselves when they were considering this particular matter <e> <s> considered that the real question at issue was the wifes earning capacity <e> <s> the words i would quote in support of that are that when they were setting out what are called the policy objectives the second of the policy objectives was described by them in this way <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is of course quite right in saying that the words of the clause are on the face of them even-handed as between the husband and the wife <e> <s> but the practical reality of the matter is that these words are of particular concern to the wife <e> <s> this was amply recognised by the law commission when they were considering this matter and that i suggest was the reason why when they were stating the second proposition with which they were concerned they described it in this way <e>", "<cs> i hesitate at this late stage in this little debate to intervene at all but i am left in some doubt as to where we now stand <e> <s> i presume that if we accept the advice of the noble and learned lord that we should wait and see what new language the draftsman produces that would mean that this afternoon and this evening we shall not be discussing any further the principle behind this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> before the amendment goes any further i wonder whether i might ask the noble and learned lord elwyn-jones a question <e> <s> he will know that amendment no <e> <s> in the names of lord mcgregor of durris myself and lady faithfull is in similar terms but differs from his in that it gives some indication of the sort of information we think ought to be collected <e> <s> the noble and learned lords amendment fails to give any indication about what sort of information is required or that the lord chancellor would be under a duty to collect <e> <s> can i ask him what attitude he takes to our amendment and whether he thinks that his is better than ours <e>", "<cs> i may add that i am waiting to hear what the noble and learned lord has to say with bated breath <e>", "<cs> i take it that the noble and learned lord is going to ask for this amendment to be withdrawn in view of what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said that the bias of his mind at present if monitoring and research were going to be carried out was to have the monitoring of the whole operation of the act and not merely of part ii <e> <s> the only observation i have to make about that and it is because the noble and learned lord has said more than once during this debate that it is important if we can to adhere to the recommendations of the law commission who considered this matter in detail is to read again the words of the <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody will disagree with what the noble and learned lord said in opening that nobody could introduce a motion of this kind with greater authority and experience than the noble lord who has done so <e> <s> he referred to what had been done by margery fry whose work laid the foundation of this report <e> <s> i do not think he would want it to be forgotten that another contribution was made and that was a report prepared by a committee of the society of justice which was published in and which i think it is fair to say was the framework upon which this scheme was based <e> <s> i am sorry to see that the noble lord has just left the chamber for a moment or two but i wanted to put that on record and to remind the house that the chairman of that committee was the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> as long ago as he had already made himself the champion of victims of violent crime <e> <s> i take some pleasure in reminding the house of that report from justice because at the moment by a curious set of chances i am temporarily the chairman of the council of justice although i played no part whatever in the preparation of the report to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to follow a speech of that kind and it may well be thought by the house that this matter has already been discussed enough <e> <s> but i should like to add a word or two for one reason <e> <s> that is because as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale remarked in the committee stage as he said i was the only person who recommended that conduct should be disregarded altogether <e> <s> i think that inadvertently he does me a minor injustice because we never got round to my amendment when i was proposing that conduct should be disregarded altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite right but the noble and learned lord has jumped in too soon because what i was about to say was that he had said that i was the only person who took that view and that that was carrying the matter too far because it was not a debate upon my amendment and therefore it was impossible to judge whether i had any support from other parts of the committee but that is a very minor matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it almost inconceivable that i should have missed any words that fell from the lips of the noble and learned lord but if i have done so i apologise <e> <s> the other point he made was that if you were to ask the court to take into consideration exceptional circumstances they would have to be circumstances which existed at the time when the court made its decision <e> <s> that i do not think the noble and learned lord said this evening but i hope that i have interpreted him correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so using the words that dr johnson used on one occasion it was the result of pure ignorance <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord has not yet seen the article he has a surprise in store for him <e> <s> certainly it will make interesting reading for him tomorrow morning over breakfast <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with the words that have fallen from the lips of the noble earl <e> <s> in my view the decision that was made in this case on the matter of costs raises a question of general importance and one of particular importance about the procedures which are followed before select committees <e> <s> very briefly i should like to recite the history of the matter slightly differently from the way is which the noble earl recited it but i hope not distorting it in any way <e> <s> it went like this <e>", "<cs> before this amendment is either not proceeded with or withdrawn may i suggest there are two other reasons which have not yet been mentioned as to why it would be the best course for the noble lord lord mishcon to accept the advice of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby and not press this amendment at this stage but bring the matter up again if he sees fit at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> the two reasons which i would advance are these <e> <s> the whole basis and mechanism of this bill is not to make the manufacture of video nasties an offence but rather to make the offence that of supplying <e> <s> i wonder how if we extend this to the export trade we are going to catch the exporter <e> <s> at what stage is he supplying <e> <s> is he supplying when he ships the goods abroad <e> <s> if that is what happens what is there to stop him <e> <s> how are we going to catch him and bring a prosecution in this country <e> <s> it obviously cannot mean supplying abroad selling it in a shop in paris for example because that is not within our jurisdiction at all <e> <s> therefore i suggest that there is this really practical problem as to what is going to be the effect if this amendment is carried <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord let us know whether any fee is payable on the registration of such a person <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord lord mishcon for a moment because the committee may be under a misunderstanding <e> <s> the noble lord has referred constantly to parts i ii and iii when i think he means sections and <e>", "<cs> no my lords but i am looking at the noble lords own amendment in which he refers to sections and <e> <s> that is what i thought he was referring to in his remarks to the minister <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord understand that i am trying to help him <e> <s> i am not being critical of him in any way <e> <s> if he will look at his own amendment he will see that it refers to sections and <e> <s> those are the present clauses and <e> <s> the effect of the noble lords amendment as i understand it and i entirely approve of it is that the code of practice will be required to cover all the matters which are referred to in the present clauses and <e> <s> i entirely support what the noble lord is saying about that but i think that in referring to parts i ii and iii he must have been bewildering the committee because the bill as a whole is divided into parts and he cannot be referring to parts i ii and iii in this particular connection <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i could try to come to the assistance of the minister because i think that he is right about this and that a lot of what has been said on this side of the committee is incorrect <e> <s> as i understand it if we look at clause we find in subsection the circumstances in which the clause shall have effect <e> <s> as i understand it subsection is an attempt to define a road check <e> <s> it says that a road check is <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause i wonder whether i may put a question to the minister about subsection <e> <s> i agree with what he said just now about its not being very informative for the public to be told how many vehicles were stopped or the duration of the road check but the two matters referred to in this subsection that is the reason for authorising each check and the result of each of them are matters in which the public would be extremely interested <e> <s> what i do not fully understand is what is meant by the words the result of each <e> <s> do they mean that if a road check is set up and nothing comes of it it has to be stated that the road block was ineffective <e> <s> that is not necessarily so <e> <s> do they mean that if somebody is arrested or some information is obtained by the road check that is what is supposed to be given as a result of the road check or what <e> <s> i should like to know what the government have in mind when they talk about the result of each <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to follow the noble and learned lord who has just spoken <e> <s> he was rightly complaining of the enormous complexity of the law upon arrest and detention <e> <s> i would only seek to remind him that four years ago we discussed all these matters in connection with scottish law <e> <s> if i may say so we made a very much better job of it than has been made by this government in this bill <e> <s> if one cares to look at the criminal justice scotland act one will see that the whole matter of arrest and detention which is dealt with in this bill in i have not counted them about clauses or two parts of the bill are dealt with in the scottish act in two clauses only <e>", "<cs> i think it would be convenient if i intervened at this point before the minister seeks to reply because i want to deal with some of the remarks that the noble baroness made in the course of our discussions on the previous amendment <e> <s> i have already taken the opportunity of drawing to the attention of the committee the astonishing ways in which some of the provisions of this bill contrast with similar provisions in the scottish act of <e> <s> here we have vet another example of how the government dealt with the matter in one way in scotland but now propose to deal with the matter in a quite different way in england and wales <e> <s> under section of the scottish act of it is quite clearly provided that the maximum period for which a person may be detained under similar provisions to the ones which we are discussing here is six hours <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gifford has said we shall come to that later in the bill <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly because i should like to say a word or two before the noble lord lord mishcon concludes the debate <e> <s> there is one matter which will probably be agreed in all parts of the committee <e> <s> it is as my noble friends have said and as the noble and learned lord lord denning has said that this is the crucial part of the bill <e> <s> the question of the right to silence is a crucial part of the crucial part <e> <s> i was a little disturbed to hear the noble lord the minister talk about this debate as bickering <e> <s> that is a very odd phrase to apply to the discussion of what has always been regarded as one of the basic rights of the individual <e>", "<cs> i shall not be particularly troubled about particular words that the noble lord used <e> <s> i should like however to say something about what was stated by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> he reminded us that it has been considered by lord justice lawton that the time may have come when we should introduce into the law of this land the right of interrogation of the suspect when in custody and when in detention <e> <s> i should like to say a word or two again i am doing this at the risk of repeating myself about what was done in scotland in <e> <s> this is an interesting aspect of what the noble and learned lord lord denning was talking about <e> <s> it is true that the scottish bill went some way down what the noble lord lord mishcon has called the road that the noble and learned lord has spoken about <e> <s> the scottish bill set out what was to happen to a person on being detained in a police station <e> <s> it stated <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that i have not got that degree of support that i might have hoped for and therefore i am not going to carry this matter to a division <e> <s> but i would still invite the noble lord to consider if he will the arguments which have been advanced <e> <s> probably the best thing i can do in endeavouring to give a brief answer to what the noble lord has said is to quote to him the conclusions which were arrived at by the majority of the royal commission <e> <s> their words are very much more potent than any that i could use <e> <s> they did not accept the argument of the noble lord that this amendment would <e> <s> in fact increase the number of arrests for <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in this debate with some hesitation because i had come here intending to make a speech along certain lines <e> <s> it has become unnecessary for me to do that in view of the admirable way in which this amendment and the other amendments which are connected with it were put to your lordships by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i wanted to take the opportunity to try if i can i do this with the greatest possible temerity to deal with two points made by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene because the noble lord may be pursuing a misconception <e> <s> what view the law society took of the matter at this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> would he consider this <e> <s> if under our proposals in amendment no <e> <s> a the suspect in the police station asks for a solicitor to be sent for and if the solicitor then turns up and the police officer in charge of the matter it would be a superintendent under the bill and an inspector under our amendment then says to the solicitor i dont want you to inform anybody that this man is under arrest and the reason i dont want you to do that is because whatever it may be the solicitor is then apprised of the fact that he must not communicate with the wife and <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that i might have the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting into a state of some little confusion but there are a few things i wanted to say about these three proposed amendments and in particular about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> some reference has already been made by the noble lord <e> <s> lord hutchinson to the fact that this amendment has been sponsored by justice and is an amendment to which justice attaches the very greatest importance <e> <s> i do not know what is the attitude of the law society on his matter except what has been disclosed to us by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however let me tell him and the house that if the law society takes the view that amendment no <e> <s> is going too far that is not a view which is shared by a great number of solicitors and members of my profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house may be under a slight misapprehension <e> <s> i have looked at this and i do not think amendment no <e> <s> is in fact a paving amendment to no <e> <s> <e> <s> if your lordships will look at subsection of clause you will see that the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is to take out some words from that subsection and it transfers those words which are words defining the meaning it transfers those words to clause which is the interpretation clause <e> <s> instead of putting the words in subsection of clause it transfers them i think quite properly to clause thereby making that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord withdraws the amendment the insertion of or instead of and would be a major alteration of the whole purpose of this new clause <e> <s> the sidenote if that is the proper word for it reads confessions by mentally handicapped persons <e> <s> if we were to accept the noble and learned lords suggestion to take out the word and from line and to insert in its place the word or we should reach the situation in which the clause would apply to anybody under the age of whether or not he was mentally handicapped <e> <s> that seems to me to be an entirely unintended extension of the new clause which has been put before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it would not be the wish of the house that i should prolong these proceedings for more than a minute or two <e> <s> however i should like to take the opportunity to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this discussion not least noble lords who have taken the other view <e> <s> i could indeed agree with the noble earl lord iddesleigh when he said that he hoped the hearing before the joint select committee would not be a rehearsal of all the arguments and so on that went on before the public inquiry <e> <s> i share that view very strongly <e> <s> what i hope is that the select committee will see it as their business to pronounce not upon the detail of this matter but upon the general principles which are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i allowed my name to be put down to speak upon the second reading of this bill only with some hesitation and my trepidation has not been done away with by discovering the high company that i am keeping when i look at the list of speakers <e> <s> i do not know which is more unnerving to be preceded by the lord chancellor and an ex-lord chancellor or to be followed by the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson of ewell <e>", "<cs> i have listened of course with the greatest care to what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has had to say <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the beginning that as a solicitor who has been in practice now for approaching years i agree with him absolutely that there has never been any difficulty in getting one firm of solicitors to act or to sue another firm of solicitors where they are asked to do so <e> <s> but listening to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor as a solicitor myself i was most desperately anxious to agree with him if i could because i am anxious to believe indeed i hope to believe that at long last a satisfactory remedy is being provided by this bill for a client who makes a complaint against a solicitor <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words to what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> whether it is right or wrong to have a two-tier profession of the kind which is suggested i suggest that it is an entirely new concept <e> <s> i cannot think of any parallel to that proposition <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that if that is to be done and if we are to set up a two-tier system surely that is not a matter that ought to be decided by the rules drawn up by the council surely that is a matter that ought to be decided by parliament and surely most of all it is a matter that ought to be decided in this house as the bill goes through and ought not to be delayed beyond the next stage of this bill <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord a question <e> <s> the second part of the clause says <e>", "<cs> may i revert in a sentence or two to the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> i cannot regard the noble and learned lords answer to that as entirely satisfactory <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord regard it as satisfactory for example that it should be permitted to the law society to make their own rules as to who they might associate with and then present them for the approval of the lord chancellor <e> <s> the noble and learned lord says it is all right <e> <s> you need not worry <e> <s> i shall not permit licensed conveyancers to associate with people whom they should not associate with <e> <s> but of course unhappily and this is one of the disasters of this life the noble and learned lord will not be with us for ever and should this very important matter of whom licensed conveyancers should be allowed to do business with and to work with be left to the discretion of the lord chancellor at some future date <e> <s> i suggest that it ought to be spelled out in the bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will at any rate be prepared to consider that possibility <e>", "<cs> if the words unprofessional conduct have governed the conduct of solicitors for so long and have apparently worked perfectly well would it not be preferable in place of the words proposed to refer simply to unprofessional conduct by licensed conveyancers <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble and learned lord will forgive me for saying at this late hour of the night that i find that answer entirely unconvincing <e> <s> i still hope that before we finish with this matter the noble and learned lord will be prepared to consider it again <e> <s> however

fulfilled <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all sure that i understand what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is recommending that we

amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he nods his head <e> <s> as i understand it that would mean that we would go back to the beginning and we leave the definition of what we are talking about entirely open and at large and give no guidance to anybody as to what we are talking about <e> <s> i do not think that that is a satisfactory solution <e>", "<cs> my lords it would obviously not be at all acceptable to the house that i should pursue this matter tonight <e> <s> i will not attempt to answer what the noble and learned lord has said except to make one observation <e> <s> we have heard of the possible proliferation of actions if legal aid were to become available for defamation especially against newspapers <e> <s> i take that illustration to demonstrate what the noble lord says is contrary to common sense <e> <s> let us consider the case of a newspaper which makes an entirely false accusation of fraud against an individual of small means <e> <s> that is about as damaging a thing as one could imagine happening to him worse then being knocked down by a bus <e> <s> the noble and learned lord says no we could not allow that applicant to have the advantage of legal aid even if it means that he will never be allowed to pursue his claim <e> <s> that is an illustration which renders obvious the unsatisfactory nature of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have support from one quarter of the house <e> <s> this is a much narrower issue than the one we dealt with just now <e> <s> it results from a case which was recently before the court of appeal called <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall not argue with the noble and learned lord upon a mere matter of fact <e> <s> i have not got the statutory instrument by me now to refer to but no doubt the noble and learned lord has already referred to it himself and he will no doubt agree with me that there is not a word in that statutory instrument which authorises police federation funds to be used to support a policeman in a defamation proceeding <e> <s> there is not a single word in that statutory instrument which limits the money to money which has been subscribed by the members <e> <s> the terms of the statutory instrument are entirely at large <e> <s> they enable the appropriate committee of the police federation to use police federation funds for the specific purpose of supporting a policeman in a libel action <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has been particularly fortunate in my view in having this bill presented to us by the noble viscount the leader of the house <e> <s> not only has he explained it all with great clarity but i think it only right to say that while he is only a recent convert to the belief that we have to put this business of interception upon a statutory basis nevertheless he has been involved in this problem for many years and i do not think anybody who has had the opportunity of looking back over the history of this matter will be in any doubt about the anxiety that the noble viscount has always shown that whatever we do in this matter we must at all costs preserve the liberty and privacy of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords if i suggested that the noble lord did not develop this point better than i did i was gravely at fault <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say just a few words from these benches <e> <s> it seems to me and to my colleagues that these three amendments are a genuine and real attempt to meet the criticism of the former clause <e> <s> i had hoped that we were going to let this go through with complete unanimity <e> <s> i was going to say to the committee that i hoped we should go on as we had started <e> <s> that has not quite happened because the noble and learned lord lord denning has raised this interesting point <e>", "<cs> i enjoy one very special advantage in the committee on this occasion if your lordships care to look down the marshalled list you will see that wherever my name appears it is immediately under that of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the result is that throughout the rest of this debate whenever he speaks i shall be merely following in his footsteps <e> <s> that is an advantage in one way but a disadvantage in another because the noble lord always covers the matter so eloquently and so fully that there is nothing left for me to say when he has finished <e> <s> i have been trying to dredge up something new beyond that which the noble lord has been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might intervene for one moment in order to try to clarify in my own mind one of the issues which appears to emerge from the argument to which we have been listening <e> <s> as i understand it the argument the noble viscount advances is basically this <e> <s> there is a fundamental difference of principle between the provisions of clauses to and clause <e> <s> he says that it would be quite inappropriate for the tribunal to consider whether the arrangements which are made by the secretary of state have in any particular case been complied with and have been conformed to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first associate myself with all that has been said about the usefulness of this debate upon this bill in this house <e> <s> to the extent that that is true it is very largely because of the attitude that has been taken from the beginning by the noble viscount the lord president of the council <e> <s> the house is in my view deeply indebted to him for the way in which he has managed this bill and for the way in which he has been prepared to listen and to accept an argument when he has found it has force <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i have listened to the last speech from the noble and learned lord lord denning with increasing misunderstanding if i may put it like that <e> <s> that is because i had the pleasure it was a pleasure of going to the exhibition that was laid on <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the noble and learned lord there <e> <s> he was there apparently picking up all the information he could garner <e> <s> he told me that he did not know anything about it when he went there but he appears to be entirely convinced by the exhibition <e> <s> i will come back to that exhibition in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords sir peter mills is perfectly capable of looking after himself <e> <s> it would be ridiculous if we could not discuss this matter without any reference to what was said in the house of commons a week or two ago by any of the members there <e> <s> how can we have a satisfactory discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave that matter there <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept every word of that <e> <s> indeed i hope that i said nothing to disagree with it <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that the noble viscount the lord president of the council has acted in good faith throughout <e> <s> i am sure of that <e> <s> but if of course the secretary of state had decided before rd april that he was going to strike down the committees ruling ought he not to have told the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house any longer <e> <s> i have gone on longer than i should have done <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the first popular applause i have had from the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make two observations in the debate <e> <s> i fully agree with what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said when he explained the matter to us <e> <s> the reform incorporated in the new arrangements for legal aid is a noble stand and one which will be of great benefit not only to those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in a police station but to the police themselves <e> <s> if a solicitor stands by a mans side when he is being interrogated with the opportunity to advise him that will eliminate almost certainly what today happens all too often <e> <s> when a case comes to court the defendant denies an alleged confession which he is supposed to have made and the time of the court is taken up for hours and sometimes for days on end inquiring as to whether the confession was true or false <e> <s> in the great majority of cases all that will be eliminated if there is a duty or any other solicitor present at the mans side <e> <s> therefore i very much welcome what has been done and i pay tribute to the way in which the noble and learned lord has steered the matter through and presented the regulations to us today <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody will regret it more than i that the noble and learned lord lord denning has had to cry off and will not be speaking to the house in this debate <e> <s> he told me that he had another engagement which he had to keep <e> <s> i deplore it particularly of course because i think it leaves me the solitary englishman who has had the temerity to take any part in this discussion <e>", "<cs> may i say one word about this matter before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate replies to this debate <e> <s> i cannot add anything to the weight of the argument which has been expressed beginning with the noble earl lord selkirk and indeed followed by every succeeding speaker <e> <s> everybody is agreed that it would be wholly inappropriate for us to be tied down at the very beginning of the discussion to the sort of board which is contemplated in clause of this bill and that we should be able now or later on to revert to this matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words in support of the remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we are dealing with a clause which is described as the duties of the board we are dealing with duties <e> <s> if it is provided as it is provided here that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may simply point out that if this amendment were accepted it would go quite a long way to meeting the proposals that were made earlier under amendments nos <e> <s> and all of which were imposing additional powers and duties on the board <e> <s> many of those powers and duties that we sought to give to the board could be better exercised by this independent advisory committee <e> <s> in view of the splendid record that the advisory committee has had in england and a succession of lord chancellors have given their evidence and testimony to that effect it would go a long way to meet some of the criticisms that have been made up to now about the board if the government were able to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly from these benches in respect of this matter <e> <s> on first reading the provision in clause i had doubts about whether i had properly understood it <e> <s> i did not believe that it could be so draconian as it apeared <e> <s> however having listened to the words that have been spoken and the surprise and astonishment already expressed i am comforted to believe that i did understand it <e> <s> this is not a matter that is concerned simply with legal aid in scotland it concerns the way we legislate <e> <s> it is really something of a constitutional issue <e> <s> according to my understanding subsection by which the secretary of state can make regulations about the class and so on of proceedings and about proceedings where legal aid shall be available and proceedings where it shall not governs the whole of part iv except possibly clause <e> <s> clause purports to set up what are the occasions when there is automatic availability of criminal legal aid <e> <s> but the whole thing is prefaced by being subject to the regulations of clause <e> <s> if one turns over the page and looks at clause there we find what is meant to be the definition of the right to legal aid in summary proceedings and there again it is qualified at the beginning by clause <e> <s> finally when one comes to legal aid in appeals in clause one finds exactly the same position <e> <s> at the top of the page it says subject to regulations and so on <e>", "<cs> i very much hesitate to express any view about scottish procedure but my belief is that this clause might have exactly the opposite effect to that which is intended <e> <s> if there were the same situation in the english courts i should suppose that the accused person would be advised by his solicitor to plead not guilty in order that he could get the legal aid certificate and then perhaps change his plea at a later stage <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words in support of that proposition <e> <s> subsection does not enable the secretary of state merely to advise the board or give the board guidance as to how it should interpret the words in the interests of justice <e> <s> it says that the secretary of state may prescribe the factors which will be absolutely binding <e> <s> there will be no discretion left in the board at all <e>", "<cs> my lords in his remarkable speech the noble lord lord paget has called into question in a very grave manner the way in which under our present dispensation we attempt to deal with cases where there is reason to believe that there has been some miscarriage of justice in the criminal courts and he has cited a number of cases one of course in particular being the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord give way <e> <s> in any of the cases which have been investigated by justice or indeed by the bbc is he asserting that in any single case there is any evidence that anybody tried to interview the jury <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were discussing this subsection in committee it was universally condemned <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord mishcon expressed grave doubts about its advisability <e> <s> that seems to have been reinforced by what has been said today <e> <s> surely it is correct to say that it is utterly unnecessary to have such a clause <e> <s> the clause in effect says subject to the qualifications that we have heard from the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that the secretary of state may if he feels inclined give advice from time to time to the board but that the board shall be under no obligation to accept it or to act in accordance with it <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree with the noble lord lord underhill that this is an amendment of considerable importance and i should like to explain how the clause and the amendment will operate in the case of exeter airport <e> <s> exeter airport is owned by devon county council and the council has been concerned as the bill has been going through parliament as to what the outcome will be for devon and exeter airport <e> <s> it still does not know whether the secretary of state will exercise his discretion provided in the bill as it now stands with regard to a threshold of million turnover and make a direction to the council with regard to exeter airport <e> <s> the council is worried as to what the situation will be if he does <e>", "<cs> i should like to pursue that for a moment <e> <s> is it not right that under clause the one just quoted by the noble lord whether the secretary of state decides eventually to give a direction to any council is a matter within his discretion <e> <s> it does not automatically happen <e> <s> he is quite entitled is he not because it is may and not shall to say to himself that he will exclude exeter because there are special circumstances there even though exeter comes within the million threshold <e> <s> that seems to be the defect in what the noble lord said about the right of local authorities to make representations to the secretary of state about why he should not make a direction or what sort of direction he ought to make <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am a little disappointed by the ministers reply but i am grateful to him for dealing with the matter so fully <e> <s> the best i can do is to say only this i cannot understand why the government have produced clause in order to prohibit what they regard as a serious evil because the only reason why the clause is in the bill is that the government think that to link the ancillary services with the loan is against the public interest <e> <s> yet the minister will not have it that it is equally against the public interest for a building society to say to a prospective borrower look you can have access to all our ancillary services our conveyancing services and the rest but only on condition that you take a loan from us <e> <s> that seems quite similar in principle <e> <s> it is an example of the linking of the ancillary services with the loan and it seems to me that it is just as objectionable as the evil with which clause at present deals <e> <s> having said that unless the minister would care to say anything further in reply i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> since the next items of business when we finish this motion are the amendments standing in my name i would be very unpopular if i inflicted any speech on the committee at this stage <e> <s> however i should not like it to be thought that i do not have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said by the noble lords lord morris and lord hacking and particularly by the noble lord lord houghton whose support and assistance i very much welcome <e>", "<cs> i thank every noble lord who has taken part in this little debate <e> <s> there are only two things that i need say before i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> first i very much appreciated the comments made by the noble lord lord broxbourne <e> <s> i think that it is the kindest thing he has said to me in years from the days when we used to engage together in the oxford union <e> <s> the noble lord rightly said that the limitations that we seek to impose are not in any way impressive and that many of them are an exact reproduction of <e>", "<cs> the noble lord rose too quickly to allow me to associate myself with what the noble lord lord williams had said <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may say a few words in support of my noble friend lord hutchinson <e> <s> i also think that it would be convenient if we also consider amendment no <e> <s> which stands in his name and mine <e> <s> all the matters spoken to by the noble lord lord plant and others and this matter are all part of the same issue <e>", "<cs> may i make one point in support of what the noble viscount lord colville has been saying <e> <s> it seems to me that under clause as it is drawn at the present moment the offence which is dealt with there can be committed in two ways <e> <s> one way is if a party which has intent to cause the person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used then uses language or behaviour of the kind which is prohibited here <e> <s> that part of the clause creates an offence which is absolutely dependent upon there being a wrongful intent on the part of the offender <e> <s> but when one goes to the test <e>", "<cs> my lords we have overshot the noble and learned lord the lord chancellors time mark <e> <s> i therefore think we ought to bring this debate to an immediate conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bear those last words closely in mind and try to adapt myself to the noble lords proposition <e> <s> first of all however even though it is some time since we had the pleasure of listening to them i should like to join in the congratulations which have been so deservedly offered to the two maiden speakers <e> <s> it does not often happen in this house that in one debate we have the pleasure of listening to two maiden speeches of such quality demonstrating such thoughtful understanding of the subject of this debate and if i may say so delivered with such eloquence <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> the only other act to which i need refer but it is one of the most important ones is the control of pollution act <e> <s> how does the system work now with this multiplicity of enactments all bearing upon the subject and of course all the planning legislation which relates to hazardous substances <e>", "<cs> with all these amendments being put to the committee may i record my pleasure and the pleasure that will be felt from the grave by the brothers fowler the authors of <e>", "<cs> before we finish this little debate i wonder whether i may draw the attention of the committee to one aspect which seems to me to be profoundly undemocratic <e> <s> under the provisions of paragraph which concerns the power of the secretary of state to direct the making or alteration of a scheme it is provided as we all know now that if a person requests a local authority to make or alter a simplified planning zone scheme but the authority refuses to do so or does not within the period of three months from the date of request decide to do so then he may subject to subparagraph require it to refer the matter to the secretary of state <e> <s> if one reads on one finds that if the secretary of state thinks fit he can impose a direction upon the local authority that it shall adopt a scheme which is to his satisfaction <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on that very important point <e> <s> in other parts of this bill as indeed in other acts of parliament the local authority is treated as a plural a number of persons <e> <s> if that is right does it not follow that who is appropriate <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e>", "<cs> i attach much importance to what the noble lord lord montagu says because it is very much in his province <e> <s> he has probably had more experience of these matters than anybody else in the committee <e> <s> i give due weight to what he has said to us today <e> <s> but i am still left in this doubt <e> <s> is it desirable <e>", "<cs> of course i readily accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am most obliged to the noble lord for the consideration that has been given to the matter <e> <s> i assure him that his remarks will be very much welcomed by the people on behalf of whom i moved the amendment <e> <s> we are very much obliged <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as may have been foreseen i indeed withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if it is still the intention of the noble and learned lord to withdraw this amendment may i make a purely practical point <e> <s> as i understand it the noble earl says that there is no need to worry because the genuine gypsy is already protected under the terms set out at the beginning of clause <e> <s> consider this in a purely practical way <e> <s> supposing the law remains as it is unamended and supposing then that somebody makes an inflammatory statement about gypsies or a section of gypsies that it is decided to institute a prosecution and that comes before a magistrates court what are they going to make of the open words of this clause if unamended <e>", "<cs> before this matter is taken to a vote and i certainly hope that my noble friend will do that because i think the answer that we have received is entirely unsatisfactory perhaps i may take the point which has just been made by the noble earl <e> <s> i make this point <e> <s> if you look at clause it would be ludicrous to put in there the words which are going to be put into section <e> <s> it would be ludicrous to say <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say too on behalf of myself and i believe on behalf of the majority at any rate of my noble friends that we agree with the argument of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and very much hope that this amendment will not be carried to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all sure that i can add very much to the arguments that have been addressed to the house by my noble friend lord hutchinson <e> <s> this is a very important matter but it is also an extremely complicated matter <e> <s> i very much doubt whether those of your lordships who have not had the opportunity to study this matter in some detail will be able to come to any really informed opinion upon these matters <e> <s> however at the same time i cannot help thinking that they are indeed of very considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may add two comments to what has already been said <e> <s> it is sometimes supposed that we in the legal profession welcome uncertainty being written into the law because we can subsequently make a field day of it <e> <s> i do not believe that that is true of the profession but certainly whenever unnecessary uncertainty is introduced into our law it is quite contrary to the public interest because it enables people to put up false defences and to obscure the real issue <e> <s> it is not only in the interests of the profession it is also in the interests of the public that the law should be as explicit and certain as it can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just one point and argument to those that have been advanced by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> we have all seen this squalid graffiti in all parts of london particularly in the part where i reside during the week which is south of the river in the neighbourhood of kennington and brixton where we are plagued with this evil <e> <s> one virtue of the proposal which the noble lord makes is that if this amendment is carried we should then be in the happy position of being able to report offensive material of this kind to the local authority <e> <s> at present i do not think that the ordinary citizen knows what he can do to enable the removal of this material from walls and so on <e>", "<cs> i intervene in this discussion with some hesitation on various counts one of which is that i am totally ignorant of the mysteries of local government finance <e> <s> but the debate on this amendment raises a matter which i think is within my comprehension and which is something that all members of the committee can comprehend and make a useful judgment upon <e> <s> in one way what we are discussing today is the meaning of words <e> <s> what do the words mean <e>", "<cs> my lords it strikes me as a little odd that we should have this proposal coming from the opposition front bench because whenever we discuss prisons we were discussing them only recently in this house there appears to be a general agreement upon two matters <e> <s> the first is that a great number of people in prison today need not be in prison <e> <s> secondly the fact that we in this country as compared with most other countries of the ec at any rate have a higher proportion of people in prison seems to be an argument for reducing rather than increasing the number of cases in which we think it necessary to send people to prison <e> <s> i can only say that i hope that the noble lord will not press the amendment because i do not think that he will get any assistance from us <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that just over two years ago my noble friend lord wigoder introduced a motion calling upon the government to introduce legislation for the repeal of section of the official secrets act and that that motion was argued and debated in this house and accepted without a division <e> <s> what more must we do in order to ensure that the government will act <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been made clear to the house the select committee was divided upon this issue <e> <s> it was divided in the proportions of three to two <e> <s> i was one of the minority of two and i hope that it is permissible and possibly even helpful if i follow the lead of the noble lord lord alport and explain briefly to the house why i came to the conclusion i did <e>", "<cs> my lords the leaflet to which the noble lord has referred sets out if i am correct or different matters <e> <s> the noble lord finds himself able to criticise it in three limited particulars <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see that that is a false manifesto or a misrepresentation of the situation <e> <s> however i do not want to get involved in controversy with anyone least of all the noble lord <e> <s> i urge on the house that we should hesitate a long time before we deliberately reject what are now transparently and openly the wishes of the people of swanage in the matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean of beswick has enumerated a number of important authorities which support the amendment <e> <s> i should like to add devon county council which shares the concern so admirably expressed by surrey county council <e> <s> the problem is particularly acute in devon <e> <s> it is a large area mostly of rural character and has a large number of small schools <e> <s> it would be in great difficulty if it were obliged to contract out the functions which are at present performed by caretakers carrying out both caretaking and security duties <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a few sentences to what has already been said <e> <s> one of the advantages of following the noble lord lord graham of edmonton in any debate is that he has usually said everything there is to be said before one rises to ones feet <e> <s> however i intervene very briefly <e> <s> the minister will remember that in committee the noble lord lord dean of beswick quoted some figures which had been provided to him by the surrey county council <e> <s> they were the number of primary schools in surrey which were likely to be affected by this part of the clause <e> <s> in no less than out of a total of primary schools there was a caretaker-cleaner the major part of whose duties was cleaning and not caretaking <e> <s> therefore those were all <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word from these benches in support of what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> it is a matter for congratulation and gratification that the government have adhered to the convention <e> <s> the only question which i wish to ask concerns a matter of fact <e> <s> as i understand it this order is made under section of the international organisations act <e> <s> that section enables representatives of international organisations and other persons to have conferred upon them by order in council certain privileges and immunities <e> <s> those privileges and immunities are to be set out and specified in the order <e> <s> that is precisely what is being done here <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl will welcome any support from me but i should like to add a few words in support of what he had to say about the principles behind the amendment <e> <s> incidentally in taking this view i do not expect to make myself very popular on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by echoing the tribute that has already been paid to the noble lord lord bancroft and the committee for what is a very remarkable and progressive report <e> <s> perhaps i may also congratulate the noble lord on his ability to present the skeleton of such a vast report within the compass of about minutes <e>", "<cs> this amendment is very largely covered by the next one which appears on the marshalled list <e> <s> in those circumstances it is not moved <e>", "<cs> i should like to offer a few observations on clause <e> <s> it is of immense importance because it seeks to outline and define the obligations of an authorised person and a solicitor <e> <s> more importantly it seeks to provide safeguards for the interests of the lay client <e>"]
